            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My aspiration to engage in the realm of social work is deeply rooted in my desire to assist vulnerable children who have experienced abuse or neglect, as well as to offer support to struggling families. The qualities I bring to this field encompass dedication, respect, and a strong ethical stance, all of which are integral not only to my professional life but also to my personal values.\n\nGrowing up, I witnessed numerous individuals retreat from confronting their issues, often employing suboptimal coping mechanisms. This compelled me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although uncertain about my career trajectory post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I decided to take some time to explore my options. During this period, I visited a friend whose young guest, a sixteen-year-old boy, was nervously perched on her couch. She shared that he was fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, I learned of his attempt to involve the authorities. Moved by his plight, I offered assistance and visited his parents’ residence, where I spoke with the police about my concerns. Despite their limited options, the police requested that I speak with the parents. Upon questioning, the parents appeared apprehensive and attributed their son's behavior to manipulative tendencies. This encounter sparked my serious consideration of a career in social work.\n\nAnother pivotal value in social work is the pursuit of social justice. Society often professes the importance of individuality but struggles to uphold this in practice. If we mourn individual losses, why do we strive for uniformity?

I am committed to a life dedicated to social justice and will continue to embody these principles in my future endeavors.",
            "This report delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The Biological model centers around genetic traits, inherited health aspects, and physiological factors. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines environmental influences and their impacts on various demographics, including race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review explores insomnia through the lens of these models, examining selected research pieces to elucidate each model. The research findings are then critically evaluated for their individual strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, secondary sleep disorders related to other mental conditions, or those resulting from medical issues or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias involve abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. Sleep disorders linked to mental conditions stem from Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders are due to medical complications or substance intake. The following review concentrates on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with a focus on their relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetics, inheritable factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons influence sleep/wake states. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be translated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype were inheritable, it could influence sleep, and alterations to the receptor could negatively affect daily life, including school, career, and tasks requiring focus.",
            "This document explores three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the condition is offered. Subsequently, the diagnosis process is detailed, including common indicators, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with guidance for educators in inclusive classrooms on supporting students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. More specifically, it involves the CNS's perceptual processing of audible data and the neurobiological activity underlying this processing, as reflected in electrophysiologic auditory responses (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process sounds accurately. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but experience difficulty deciphering or distinguishing between sounds.\n\nThe earliest known reference to CAPD, initially called \"auditory imperception\", dates back to the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered tests for children with communicative challenges in 1954. Kimura later introduced dichotic testing and developed a model for the physiological basis of dichotic perception in 1961. A national conference in 1977 further fueled research on CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD are diverse: individuals may struggle to pinpoint or hear sounds in space, differentiate between simultaneous sounds, recognize sound patterns, or detect changes in speech (like sarcasm). They may also struggle with blocking out sounds, synthesizing sound clues, or determining the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves assessing auditory function through systematic observation and performance on various tests. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists administer these tests, using diverse measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. No single tool guarantees consistent diagnostic success, and the causes of CAPD remain unknown. Common tests involve presenting multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking individuals to identify specific items, while advanced tests measure responses to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the theme of disguise and its consequences is a recurring motif. While masquerade can be a tool for deception, it is ultimately a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows one to escape the truth, but on the other, it can lead to a permanent loss of identity. The challenge lies in choosing between self-preservation and maintaining relationships. Disclosure can lead to alienation, and not all will respond with understanding or forgiveness.\n\nThe matter of deception in gender role reversal is particularly intricate. Why would someone adopt a disguise and assume the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's a survival mechanism, a way to protect herself. Arriving in a strange land, she dons male attire to safeguard her safety: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Yet, this masquerade isolates her from women, cutting her off from potential allies. Moreover, her convincing portrayal as a man causes Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138).\n\nDespite the intrigue, some might argue that this play serves as a catalyst for suppressed emotions. The characters' responses to Viola/Cesario, especially Olivia and Orsino, reveal hidden feelings. Orsino, for instance, struggles with his unexpressed desires: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). Olivia's swift shift from romantic interest to familial affection—“A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)—suggests a deeper, less superficial understanding.",
            "The grim legacy of German colonial rule is undeniably marked by its harsh treatment, most notably the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. The German colonial enterprise, however, cannot be reduced to such a singular narrative. It was a complex tapestry of varying policies and administrative styles, as varied as its geographical landscape. Educational initiatives across the colonies mirrored this diversity. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British found a sizable population of educated Africans, and contemporary accounts also commended German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa, now Namibia, starkly contrasted. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives through state schools, the task of educating the indigenous population in South West Africa was predominantly left to missionary societies with limited government backing. The colonial government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing a robust system of state schools and substantially supporting and regulating missionary institutions. These educational policies had profound and lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\" A myriad of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent educational experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular focus on recent research exploring the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous population.\n\nA plethora of literature exists on the topic of education within the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were penned in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily sought to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language texts expanded on this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as the most relevant to this paper. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and attributes many of the distinctions to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nUnlike other German colonies, South West Africa boasted a moderately temperate climate, with much of its landscape covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Over the course of a century, the categorization of Popular Music has expanded to encompass a multitude of genres, making a comprehensive list quite challenging. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nearly all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and beyond—have developed numerous sub- and sub-sub-genres within their domain. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most versatile and emotionally expressive genres in the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from the wide spectrum of emotions it embodies, often leaning towards darker sentiments. Diverse in nature, Heavy Metal quickly demonstrated its flexibility, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nIn modern Heavy Metal, the sheer number of niche groups has made it difficult to pinpoint precisely what constitutes the genre. It has adopted themes from numerous other genres, yet like all creative movements, it has its roots. To comprehend the Heavy Metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the Heavy Metal movement and why it exists as more than just a genre.\n\nMetal can be seen as a movement that embraces darkness. It is often characterized by increased intensity—more bass, louder volume, greater volatility, and theatricality. Musicians in Metal bands exhibit exceptional instrumental proficiency, which is evident in their music. Moreover, Metal is intrinsically linked to drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s fueled the creation of many innovative, otherworldly records, with musicians using drugs as a catalyst for their compositions. The genre's dark, visceral qualities were a striking departure from the more mainstream, less intense popular music of the time. Later generations of Metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify the darker emotional undertones that are a hallmark of the Metal movement. This song, considered by some to be one of the earliest Heavy Metal tracks, was a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones track. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to produce similarly intense music, resulting in a heavier sound for \"The White Album.\"",
            "Prior to the inception of Surrealism's dreamlike canvases, Henri Rousseau was already sculpting his own visions, both practically and spiritually. \"The Dream,\" his 1910 masterpiece, does not merely depict a woman in a trance amidst a dream landscape; it is a manifestation of Rousseau's personal aspirations and aspirations as an artist. From the outset, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, yet he faced an internal conflict: to adhere to or imitate existing artistic styles for acceptance, or to forge his own unique path. Analyzing \"The Dream\" through this lens necessitates an understanding of Rousseau's life story.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844. His father, a tinsmith and hardware merchant, enjoyed middle-class prosperity. With no formal art training, he worked as a customs inspector until the age of forty. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infants left him with only one daughter, Julia, and deep sorrow. He turned to painting for solace and new beginnings, unlike his contemporaries who often idealized the peasantry in their art. Instead, Rousseau was a folk artist with the hopes and dreams of a humble commoner.\n\nRousseau's longing for art world acceptance becomes clearer when considering his background: he was untrained, started late in life, and worked alongside many established, talented artists. Recognition only came around the time Matisse was gaining prominence. In \"Modern French Painters,\" author Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau sought to create a conventional work that would gain admission to the Artiste Français, showing their contrasting motivations and approaches.",
            "Numerous philosophical minds have posited that ethics and aesthetics share an intrinsic bond, with truth and beauty intertwined in a symbiotic dance. It strikes me as plausible that at a quintessential level, this union is not coincidental. As John Keats expounded in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our knowledge is predominantly shaped by education or life's experiences, it seems we derive appreciation for ethics and aesthetics in a more profound, less explicit manner. Both fields, in essence, seek to elucidate rather than dictate. Our exploration of virtue and beauty is largely an attempt to comprehend why certain art or action is deemed so, rather than a set of rules for judgement or creation. It's a conundrum: the scrutiny of art or morals often fails to encapsulate their essence. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance. Although discussions might revolve around techniques like perspective, contrast, or cultural relevance, these elements don't encapsulate why it's considered great. Instead, we often hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it\" preceding more detailed explanations. I propose that both art and morality possess this enigmatic quality, a je ne sais quoi that transcends description. Flannery O'Connor, in her wisdom, asserted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, morality defies complete articulation. Ludwig Wittgenstein's musings align: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This transcendental nature, this ineffable quality, is the most potent attribute of both art and morality, and it's this shared trait that fosters a connection between them. We experience morality and art most powerfully at a subliminal level, a Kantian noumenal realm where they touch our souls, yet elude full explanation. This connection is especially pronounced in literature, as McKean posits, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The contemporary Germany stands as a formidable power, a nation that bears a distinctive cultural identity, stretching from the shadowed heights of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic seashore of Kiel. This unique culture permeates cities like Cologne along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and into the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Given this rich cultural tapestry, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Germany today is the product of diverse influences and tribes.\n\nThe ancient homeland of the Germans, Germania, is shrouded in mystery regarding the origins of its name. Tacitus, a Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from the Tungri, a Germanic tribe who once crossed the Rhine and clashed with Gauls, although this assertion is debated. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, utilized the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine. The Gauls themselves might have imparted this name, or it could be traced to a spear in their language or the Old Irish term for 'shout', signifying the Germans' warlike nature (OED, 2010).\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous, untainted by foreign influence, as few would choose to migrate to Germania's harsh climate and lands. The Romans, too, primarily sent expeditions to Germany for resources and occasionally led land campaigns, but they generally returned to their vast empire (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17). As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the empire's fringes, trading goods and skills within the Roman army's ranks.",
            "I gazed down, my thoughts emptied and mind clear, at the sight before me. Unwavering, my consciousness assessed the scene, each detail carefully scrutinized but not understood. Thoughts darted in and out of my mind, swift and fluid, as if they were witnessing the scene vicariously rather than engaging with it. I had always aspired to capture the beauty of art with my hands, and a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" had been my guide. The book taught me to simplify complex scenes by framing them in a square, transforming a bustling kitchen into a simple bowl of fruit.\n\nHowever, as I stood there, the sight of the bowl was too much to process. The grandeur of artistic greats like Picasso and Monet was a stark contrast to the reality of my task. The beginnings of my artistic journey, I thought, had now been reduced to this: the mess in the toilet at Rite Aid.\n\nI picked up my rag, feet planted firmly, tie knotted tightly, and stared at the offending substance. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, then I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand like a glove. I dipped my hand into the bowl, my mind filled with the tranquility of a mother preparing Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "The alarming statistics reveal that adolescents behind the wheel are at a significant risk. A confluence of factors contributes to this stark fact, particularly the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not fully equipped to navigate the perils of driving. Naivety about driving, coupled with overconfidence, often leads to catastrophic outcomes, including fatal crashes, rollovers, and speeding incidents. The presence of peers in the vehicle exacerbates these risks, as evidenced by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center.\n\nIn attempts to bolster teen driver safety, many states, including California, have implemented provisional licenses that impose driving hour restrictions and restrictions on minor passengers. However, these measures are insufficient. The crux of the problem lies in the collective inability of young drivers to manage the inherent risks adequately. Experts suggest that even at 18, teens may not be fully prepared for the responsibilities of driving. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman indicates that adolescents up to the age of 19-20 often engage in thrill-seeking behaviors, which can translate into risky driving habits.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, a simple legislative solution could be proposed. Schools could offer early driver education classes, but no individual under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, contingent upon completing a certain number of practical driving hours, a common requirement in many states. By delaying full driver's license issuance until at least 19 years old, we can potentially reduce the prevalence of deadly accidents on our roads.\n\nThe proposed legislation isn't unprecedented, but it could significantly impact safety nationwide. If implemented, it would provide a uniform standard for teen drivers, addressing the issue of adolescent risk-taking and improving overall road safety.",
            "Sifting through the Library of Congress’s archive of antique Edison films, I chanced upon a collection of fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films primarily rely on artistic editing to create illusions. My analysis was centered around documenting the poetic elements common in most trick films and investigating the anomalous traits present in a few of the later ones. The majority of trick films from this era are confined to a static stage within a frontal proscenium, eschewing camera movement, and utilizing long and medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equates to one film. However, some films from the early 20th century dared to deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\nA striking characteristic shared by these trick films is their filming within a stationary interior set framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining fixed in position. This composition, deeply rooted in theatrical conventions and vaudeville magic acts, restricts figures to horizontal movements, with characters entering and exiting the frame without the camera following. Consider the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors move back and forth along the horizontal axis, exiting the frame without the camera tracking them.\nThis static composition also lends itself to predominantly long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all trick films in the Edison collection, echoing the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors remain in the middle ground, avoiding camera movements that would necessitate close-ups.\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot equals an entire film. This constraint limits their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also constrains their dramatic or narrative potential, with many focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with minimal storytelling. However, it's crucial to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot does not equate to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" may comprise several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Study The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) to see how the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film appears as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "In a region where the surname Taylor is of considerable renown, John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and fervent advocate for the Republican cause. His primary occupation as an agriculturalist, coupled with a short-lived foray into politics, shaped him into a steadfast exponent of personal liberties and government structure. His passionate commitment to agrarian pursuits served as the cornerstone for his perspectives on governance, influencing his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial framework.\n\nJohn Taylor, with considerable foresight, believed the United States held a singular chance to forge an optimal government system, unencumbered by indigenous traditions. He strongly held that the natural rights of individuals are interdependent and should lie beyond the purview of the government. He posited that the \"state of nature,\" where physical prowess and cunning ruled, would not be acceptable in a civilized society.\n\nTo cultivate this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent goodness and evil in human nature. He espoused a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is wielded by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalistic excess. He maintained that a government founded on such principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administrators' avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was inherent in human nature but only considered malevolent when it led to the detriment of the collective good. He saw the necessity of a good government to control man's natural evil, yet it should be closely supervised to prevent the infusion of corrupting principles.\n\nTaylor, along with many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, with no powers exceeding those explicitly outlined. Recognizing the potential despotism of a powerful Federal government, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, more explicitly describing the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "In revisiting Figure 17, a sharp decline in commuter log submissions was observed during the third month of the project. This was somewhat disconcerting, yet the reason remains elusive. The arrival of winter in a New England setting likely contributed to the drop, as it discourages commuting by bicycle or on foot. The end of the fall semester in December also plays a role, as students and faculty are preoccupied with final tasks, causing the commuter log to fall off the radar. Additionally, December signifies the beginning of the holiday season, leading to a one-month break for students and faculty, during which campus visits are not necessary. The resumption of classes in late January might also contribute to February's low log count. Naturally, projects like these often experience an initial surge followed by a gradual decline. To counteract this, a special challenge week, the \"Carpool Challenge,\" was implemented in March, which successfully boosted log submissions. The project faced two primary obstacles: the inherent appeal of driving one's car and the need to provide incentives to encourage alternative commuting methods. Various rewards, such as gift certificates to local businesses, were distributed. Larger prizes, like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, might have further boosted engagement. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but varying the offerings could have potentially increased participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mirror an index, commodity, or a basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund, along with the advantages of single stock ownership, such as selling short, buying on margin, and purchasing even a single share in any transaction. While these benefits are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than most mutual funds. However, they also come with a downside: a commission is charged for each trade, just as with stocks. Additionally, ETFs offer a broad range of funds, but it is prudent for smart investors to assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will investigate the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to ascertain if owning a single ETF approximates the benefits of holding a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether there are more optimal configurations of these same stocks that could yield a better Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo make our analysis manageable, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio consist solely of these ten stocks in the proportions established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations for Beta and return are presented in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it is evident that the return of a portfolio made up of just the top ten holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, indicating a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF. These preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, it is essential to verify if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" deemed one of his finest works, incorporates a curious reference to \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines 6 and 56. This term, traced back to Virgil, originally denoted an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world for the Greeks. While Virgil certainly employed the term, Poe's usage might also be attributed to a more contemporary source. Poe was deeply engrossed in German literature, a fact evident in his familiarity with Goethe's works, specifically his poem \"Mignon.\" Karl J. Arndt's analysis in \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights striking similarities between the two poems, suggesting Poe's imitation of Goethe. This connection becomes clearer when one considers the poem \"The King of Thule\" from Faust's second part, written by Goethe and later adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe's repeated use of \"Thulé\" in his writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" further underscores this linkage. The poem \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" mirroring the dark, lonely landscape and haunting imagery of Goethe's poem. The speaker's description of Thule, with its shrouded world and absence of color, echoes the despair of the King of Thule following his wife's death. Additionally, Poe's respect for Tennyson, who admired Goethe, likely exposed him to the latter's works through various reproductions after their initial publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could an injured patron of a grocery store, who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill, potentially secure punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice because he was made aware of the spill twice and neglected to address it for half an hour due to dining? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To sustain such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were deliberately harmful and showed a willful disregard for the probable consequences. Palmer could argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm given previous incidents but failed to remedy the situation. While the claim of malicious intent may not be irrefutable, it remains plausible given the history of slip-and-fall accidents in the store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, alerted his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on a dinner break and \"didn’t have the time\" to deal with the spill. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin of the same issue, and his response remained the same. By 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, resulting in a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five similar incidents had been reported in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we are assessing whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a non-contractual breach if the defendant's actions were \"oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, despicable conduct committed with a willful disregard for the safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "In the late summer of 2008, I participated in a course on Islamic studies at CBC, where the topic of Islam's hostility towards other religions sparked considerable debate. This discussion, now four years later, remains pertinent. The post-9/11 media landscape has seen a shift from a critical view of Islam and extremism to one of remarkable tolerance in the United States. For instance, the election of a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim heritage, would have been unthinkable in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to contradict my understanding of his character. Historical accounts suggest that Muhammad employed force to convert tribes to Islam, yet his biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble. People supposedly came to believe in his teachings on their own accord after he displayed humility.\n\nThere are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For example, the story of the multiplication of mutton and milk for forty men is reminiscent of Jesus' feeding of the five thousand. Such narratives suggest a deliberate attempt to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, who lived by his truths and miracles, rather than proving them. This dilution of Jesus' life and miracles is concerning, as it seems to appropriate his legacy.\n\nMany stories in the biography are presented as oral accounts through multiple intermediaries, which can undermine their credibility. They may intend to validate the narratives, but the use of third-party accounts makes them appear more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a pious, benevolent, and wise figure. However, historical accounts portray him as a powerful and assertive individual. Given this, it's intriguing to consider whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs held by Jesus during his mortal life did not endure in the evolution of Christian thought following his demise. A historical overview reveals a trajectory where Christianity has gradually drifted from its roots. The modern world exhibits an increasing consciousness and progressive inclination, with traditionalists maintaining their resistance to novel ideas, though they may not significantly influence the whole. Among Christians, there is an anticipated surge in historical consciousness. This awareness will fuel a desire to differentiate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the essence of the religion's founder. This process may take years or centuries, but it is unavoidable: a return to Christianity's original form is inevitable. A movement will emerge, systematically stripping away layers of doctrine, as if time itself is rewinding, until only the seeds Jesus planted remain. When this tide sweeps through America and Europe, it will inspire multitudes to emulate the practices of Jesus' era, and the church will stand as a beacon. However, as the theological clock reverses, the current proliferation of Christian diversity will give way to uniformity. Regional, denominational, and divisive differences will yield to commonalities. History is replete with such reversals. The Christian faith, once shunned and persecuted by the Roman Empire, later became its dominant religion. Likewise, America transitioned from racial oppression to racial leadership. The pending reversal in Christianity will unravel this history, seeking its source, and unifying belief and practice. This transformation will hinge on interpreting Jesus' words symbolically, not literally. Thus, what changes transpired since Jesus' life?\n\nA deep dive into history reveals that Judaism, Christianity's theological predecessor, was at the core by the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were integral components of this religion. The Jewish populace was not unified, encompassing groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common folk",
            "In \"The Jungle,\" Upton Sinclair elucidates the intrinsic nature of humanity as inherently egoistic and self-serving. Individuals prioritize their own well-being over others, particularly those they deem lower, in their pursuit of prosperity and success. Sinclair's novel exemplifies this through the owners and managers of vast factories. Their singular focus is on expanding their empire, unconcerned with collateral damage or the suffering they inflict. Sinclair's description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" signifies the extensive wreckage caused by their avarice. They are oblivious to the harm these factories impose, be it the toxic smog or the filth from the animal enclosures.\n\nMoreover, these managers and owners exhibit no regard for their workers' welfare. Their primary objective is to maximize profits, as evidenced by Sinclair's phrase, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subject employees to exorbitant hours and summarily dismiss them without compensation or support, exploiting the lack of protective laws or regulations during that time. The workers, trapped in this grim system, are likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Various authors employ distinct methods to cultivate a specific atmosphere or perspective in their readers towards significant themes. Fitzgerald, in his masterpiece \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs several of these techniques with notable efficacy. He frequently combines adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to foster a particular ambiance around key subjects. Additionally, he invests symbols with specific meanings and employs them to convey these same sentiments. Fitzgerald utilizes this strategy extensively with colors, most notably gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald ascribes significance to these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later employs these meanings to evoke a sense of familiarity or importance around crucial elements.\n\nWhite/gray represents uniformity, with white conveying a sense of elegance and social standing, and gray signifying age and faded prominence. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning early in the novel through repetitive use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently depicted in white attire, ranging from Daisy's “white girlhood” (19) to Jordan's “white dress” (45). Even minor characters, like the dog-seller, are described as “a gray old man” (27), reinforcing the association of gray with aging and faded importance. The valley of ashes is characterized by “gray cars” and “gray land” (23), further solidifying this connection.\n\nAfter establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify insignificance or mundanity around certain subjects. This technique first manifests in relation to Daisy. After a prolonged absence of significant color use, Daisy is described as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform, desired object to Gatsby. Fitzgerald reinforces this impression with multiple instances where Daisy is depicted in white attire, such as her “white dress” (115) before Tom and Gatsby's altercation, and her “gray haze of fur collar” (18).",
            "The region of San Diego County is renowned for its agricultural prowess, largely due to its warm, sunny climate. The area cultivates a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organically grown community-supported agriculture products is considerable within the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations boasting lengthy waitlists. Additionally, organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such an operation could provide multiple benefits, including taking advantage of government programs, enhancing wildlife habitats, and creating revenue streams through tours and educational programs.",
            "The influence of culture on negotiating dynamics is substantial. Defined as much by what it excludes as what it includes, culture is neither uniform nor singular. Generalizations like \"all Russians are unyielding\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify cultural nuances. A skilled negotiator should focus on understanding how a culture's values and attitudes can shape discussions at the table. When encountering foreign cultures, one naturally compares them to their own, which can guide the approach. Exploring a culture's history or uncovering its biases can aid comprehension. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, acceptance and working within its parameters, especially with a weaker position, is crucial. Even when negotiating on foreign turf, respecting local traditions and beliefs can smooth cultural obstacles and drive progress.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that culture isn't confined to national borders. A nation's corporate culture can vary widely. For example, some companies prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture reveals itself in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and attitudes toward employee philanthropy. American corporate culture alone demonstrates this diversity, with differences across regions and environments. Some cultures appear more uniform, but a deeper dive is necessary to uncover their intricacies.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally vital. If a culture values saving face or collective harmony, a negotiator will avoid public shaming. Conversely, cultures that prioritize tough bargaining may resist early settlements. Keeping these considerations in mind before negotiations begins is important. However, gaining personal insights about an opponent can also enhance the negotiation process.",
            "The text \"There is no God\" is uttered by the fool, as expounded in Psalm 14 and St. Anselm's argument. Thomas Aquinas, another notable figure, also adheres to this belief. To compare their respective arguments, we must assume they both uphold the existence of the God of the Bible. Disregarding a deity that differs from this specification would hinder the comparison, as their arguments are centered on this singular concept. Despite their individual merits, neither truly establishes a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, as presented, emphasizes the pursuit of understanding through faith, asserting that God's existence is inherent in our minds. While his reasoning can seem convoluted, his core premise is that God's proof is found within our own comprehension. This notion, often labeled as faith, disregards the need for external evidence.\n\nIn contrast, Aquinas argues for the existence of God through rational thought and empirical evidence, eschewing faith entirely. This approach could enhance Christian outreach by swaying potential converts through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments, each demonstrating God's logical necessity. For instance, if one is missing a puzzle piece, one can deduce its existence and features without seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, an individual who would later be recognized as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he chose to withdraw from worldly affairs, achieving enlightenment. The spiritual path he paved gave birth to Buddhism, which today stands as the most traditional branch, known as Theravada Buddhism. Now nearing its twenty-five-hundredth anniversary, the religion has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. Consider the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. This event involves both monks and laypeople, holding symbolic importance despite Buddha's teachings never mentioning such rituals. This dynamic evolution extends from superficial traditions to the very essence of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community—both monastic and lay—has adapted its core beliefs over time, a process influenced by internal and external factors, both those that aid and those that hinder.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently employed in this discussion. Here, internal forces refer to those stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often due to negative perceptions. Benign forces are those that do not intend to aid or harm, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will recur throughout this exploration.\n\nTo begin, let us delve into the fundamentals of Theravada Buddhism—its core doctrines. Buddhists find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, essentially the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts includes the Sutta Pitaka containing all Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka with its disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with its metaphysical components. These include concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognizing these leads to escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and thus ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, including five precepts for laypeople (no killing, no lying, no stealing, no misconduct, no intoxicants) and more for monks. The core doctrinal principle is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a prolonged rivalry that lasted for five decades, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry, as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145), reached its summit with the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the U.S. triumphed and annexed Texas and the Southwestern territories. Other skirmishes between these two nations also occurred, finally tapering off before the onset of World War I. The roots of this discord were complex, involving cultural, religious, and material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is a common phenomenon among neighboring nations. Shared borders often breed rivalries due to conflicting interests, as seen in the case of the U.S. and Mexico, and other similar historical rivalries (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41). Like Mexico and Cuba, these nations share geographical proximity to the U.S. and have historically been adversaries, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained cordial relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious tensions have historically fueled such rivalries, including that between the U.S. and Mexico. Frahm (2001, p. 86) observes that Americans' opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century mirrored their earlier aversion to Catholicism and monarchy. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry, much like the Cold War, was both ideological and competitive over vital interests. The mutual mistrust could be traced back to the historic animosity between the English and Spanish, which lingered as a barrier to friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. within this 57-year period. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, such as border raids and other frontier problems. Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes that these issues persisted until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders. The rivalry gradually subsided as Mexico's dependency on the U.S. became evident, and finally ended as U.S. ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, a sudden, unforeseen ailment struck me, rendering me unexpectedly incapacitated. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession as an anchor against the instability and uncertainty I felt as a child, driven by the belief that illness and the need for care would always be present. Yet, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I was drawn to nursing for the steady foundation it offered.\n\nAt 46, now, I find myself disabled, with little savings and no employment prospects. Life has become a daily battle, a relentless struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-respect. After fifteen years of relying on disability benefits, I have nothing left to call my own. The love and support from my family and a handful of friends have been my lifeline. When life's storms hit, it's humbling to realize how helpless one can feel, even with inner strength.\n\nMy experience teaches me that emergencies, both grand and minute, are inevitable. No matter how well-equipped or prepared one is, some challenges are simply too vast to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that Americans should not rely solely on ailing government systems, I advocate for a return to mutual trust and assistance, encouraging us to support one another rather than isolating ourselves. The spirit of our nation was not founded on rugged individualism but on compassion, respect, and shared resources.\n\nSo, while preparing is certainly wise, I urge you to also build connections in your community. Stock your disaster kit, equip yourself with first aid supplies and emergency rations, but also reach out to those around you. In times of crisis, we are stronger together than we are alone.",
            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there limitations or boundaries that shape the trajectory of evolutionary change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical terms even the simplest organic shapes.\" This sentiment persists today, though mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through developmental and evolutionary lenses (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation explores the interplay of mathematical modeling with ontogenetic and phylogenetic transformations in Prunum, complemented by experimental studies, to illuminate the underlying mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. X-radiographic images of Prunum species were utilized to quantify parameters that could model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). Hypothetical shell morphologies were created to interpret the range of possible morphological shifts in Prunum. These results are integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain deeper insights into macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a spiral-tube structure traversing through 360 degrees of space, with each turn of the shell called a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and the line separating each whorl is termed a suture. The largest whorl, the final whorl, is called the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the base is the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nTo count whorls, first observe the shell from the apical view to locate the first suture, then draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count whorls from this line, approximating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a progression of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced through the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted graphically and mathematically, allowing parameters to be varied and thus modifying the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has shown little improvement. While the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have been insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortcomings will be explored below, indicating a need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than focus solely on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen a rise in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this category includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in case of complications, contributing to the high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Improvements in this indicator are therefore somewhat deceptive, overshadowing the remaining work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by healthcare professionals. Data on postnatal care is incomplete but indicates low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%, but urban areas have higher rates (7%) compared to rural areas (2%), highlighting disparities in healthcare access. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with the poor facing greater challenges accessing healthcare, likely due to financial barriers.\n\nConsidering future steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most crucial question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific strategies or fortify the entire healthcare system, focusing on pre and postnatal care for mothers and children? While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, they may also lead to funding imbalances, draw human resources to better-funded areas, and result in duplicated and uncoordinated services.",
            "Victorian literature is distinguished by its intricate focus on details and its penchant for aristocratic themes. Two texts, however, diverge from this norm: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works incorporate an element of enigma and eccentricity, uncommon among their peers, which enriches the characters' personas and elucidates their motivations and emotions.\n\n“Amidst a flurry of bewildering and perplexing notions, they flooded his mind. He seemed to be still traversing the path with Sikes and Crackit, engaged in heated argument: the very words they uttered echoed in his ears; and when he snapped back to awareness, … he found himself conversing with them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the report of fire arms; and there erupted a cacophony of cries and shouts; lights danced before his eyes, and chaos reigned, as an unseen force hurriedly bore him away. Throughout these swift visions, an indistinct, unsettling awareness of discomfort lingered, gnawing at him unceasingly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these tales, the element of mystery is often woven through dream sequences or dreamlike states, each with its own unique content and purpose. In Oliver Twist, these anomalous occurrences frequently unearth insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his pain, and his comprehension of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences it anew, as if in a dream, as he unsuccessfully seeks assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events, his dire health, and the persistent discomfort, as well as his hallucinatory encounters with Sikes and Crackit. The shooting is overpowering; his senses are numbed, and he fails to notice the “unseen hand” bearing him away; he relives his despair, now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. Given this, the question arises: whose will brought about his misfortune? It certainly was not his own. This shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over any event's outcome, even when his life is at stake. An underlying sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, one might assume Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it began – and night descended upon him again; night so protracted, yet so fleeting; long in its dreadful silence and brief in its hurried hours.”",
            "Some time back, I engaged in an after-school program assisting young students. I endeavored to support them in their academic challenges, with a particular aptitude for English and reading. I was summoned by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, likely in the third or fourth grade, experiencing difficulties with reading. I soon noticed an unusual pattern: he could pronounce certain letters flawlessly while others left him baffled. Intrigued, I discovered that Adrian, despite his monolingual English, was struggling with the alphabet. This realization was a turning point, as his mother, who spoke only Spanish, revealed that Adrian's true impediment was not language proficiency but familiarity with the English alphabet.\n\nThis anecdote underscores the challenges posed by language barriers in education, especially in California. Even a child who speaks fluent English can face significant obstacles in reading due to a limited understanding of the alphabet. The solution, in Adrian's case, was straightforward: enhanced tutoring in English, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students with limited English, the path to proficiency is more intricate, demanding a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, for instance, could be beneficial for all students, not just those for whom Spanish is their first language. Research shows that these programs can boost academic performance. Yet, there's a misconception that these programs are wasteful and mainly advantageous to a minority. In reality, if implemented universally, these programs could benefit all students. How can we achieve this? Mandating all teachers to be bilingual isn't feasible, but we could certainly incorporate bilingual assistants or tutors into classrooms.",
            "The journey of spirituality is a path each individual traverses, influenced by familial narratives and personal introspection. Some embrace the teachings of organized religion, while others reject them, claiming a self-reliant understanding of existence. Regardless of the chosen path, the pursuit of spiritual understanding leaves an indelible mark on our identities. We search for illumination in darkness, seeking clarity amidst the shadows.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my father responded, eyes reflecting the rain's relentless descent as we sat on the porch, puffing away. The tin roof hissed above us, while the gutters gushed water around us. He was gaunt, his hair thinner than I recalled, as he stared into the rain. It was a look I'd seen before, both distant and reminiscent. I felt isolated, anxious, unable to voice my fears about his impending departure. I embraced him, pulled my chair closer, and gazed into the falling rain together.\n\nMy father left us in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his life but failed to alleviate his pain. I couldn't fathom the reasoning behind this delay, nor the divine architect who might have been responsible. In the hushed silence of the night, I offered no supplications. If a higher power existed, it seemed to have lost interest in my life.\n\nI'd chosen not to witness his transition. The image of my creator slowly ceasing to be was too much to bear. Instead, I clung to memories of his life, not his death. I was his sole child, understanding him better than any other. I knew he wouldn't wish for me to be a witness to his final moments. I curled up in my bed for three days, awaiting news of his passing. Ironically, no one bothered to inform me of his death. I was the last to know.",
            "The traditional Gothic Novel, as Ian Watt posits in his seminal work The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is an apparent oxymoron, a phrase that combines 'Old-New.' This literary mode has been subject to both severe criticism and high praise, often labeled as having no substantial depth, yet simultaneously lauded for its 'terrible sublime' quality. The inaugural Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, deftly weaves together themes of both 'ancient' and 'modern' romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre, and a new literary technique. Walpole employs 'old' theatrical elements and 'new' mimetic nature in 'modern' novels to present his 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, yet the term 'gothic' at the time of Otranto's publication was used to denote various peoples, styles, and eras, viewed as archaic or unsophisticated in contrast to 'modern' societal and literary advancements. The fusion of theatrical 'Gothic' elements and the new novel format, which offers a more personal glimpse into character psychology, is what has sustained Gothic's longevity, making it appear both obsolete and fresh to a reader distant in time. One quintessential Gothic theme is chivalry, the medieval ideal of knightly training, which the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, preserves and refines. Chivalry is pivotal to Gothic writers, embodying the classic knight as brave, honorable, and competent, a contrast to the perceived decline in societal morality. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil and facing unfair accusations, may have felt the supposed virtue of the Gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This is evident in his character Frederic, who exudes chivalric qualities: a prince, a sufferer, and a perceived victim of infidels, with exaggerated gallantry and courtesy, exemplifying the emerging Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain orchestration, a sequence of activities, involves the transport of goods from the point of customer request through the raw materials phase, production, and distribution until it reaches the customer. The concept of supply chain orchestration was introduced in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. Oliver described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customers' needs swiftly and effectively. Six crucial components constitute a supply chain: production, procurement, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase of the supply chain, forms its bedrock. Here, managers determine the 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' of production. To ascertain customer preferences, managers analyze market trends. Once the market's demands are understood, managers decide which products to manufacture and in what quantities. Subsequently, they select the most suitable production site, considering both volume and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction. After establishing the production location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Thorough planning is paramount in production, as any oversight can lead to significant time and monetary losses. For instance, I previously worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee attire to receiving shipments, was meticulously outlined in a process manual. This structured approach ensured smooth operations without directional ambiguity or confusion.\n\nThe second key component of supply chain orchestration is procurement. It involves strategic decisions to define a facility's core competencies and establish outsourcing partnerships. A single product might span multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, labor, and expertise. Managers must identify the most suitable division for each production process. Outsourcing work to external companies can enhance speed, quality, and flexibility while keeping costs low or maintaining cost-effective levels.",
            "On a bustling city street, a lone figure stands with a handmade sign, bearing an enigmatic message. The sign reads, \"Hitler lives in Burma.\" Burma, a nation in Southeast Asia, is governed by a repressive military regime that seized control in 1962, suppressing dissent until recent times. In 2007, a series of demonstrations, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted, led by monks and eventually joined by the public. Violent clashes ensued, with the military junta targeting monasteries and journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, who was killed in September 2007. Official reports of deaths stand at 13, but defecting Colonel Hla Win claims thousands more were killed. This is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, numerous regimes have sought to stifle dissent. Early emperors of Rome and Japan, and even the current U.S. President, have been accused of exercising undue power. Notable examples include the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where the death toll ranges from a few hundred to over 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias and the government systematically murdered Tutsis and moderates. Hitler's Third Reich is another infamous case, where Jews were systematically persecuted and killed across multiple countries.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on jazz can be attributed to his extensive career and his adeptness in directing his orchestra. Ellington's role on the piano, though often understated in the pieces chosen for this task, does not diminish his prowess as a composer. He excelled in crafting intricate and multifaceted compositions that spotlighted the unique talents of his band members. This ability to form a setting for soloists to freely improvise, alongside his skill in writing carefully arranged sections and phrases that called upon the distinctive styles of band members, allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra. By mastering the individual voices of his musicians and their interplay within the ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation with a reference to \"Creole Love Call,\" a piece where voice is used as a jazz instrument. This is an early instance of Ellington's use of voice to add nuance and color without the constraint of lyrics. \"Creole Love Call,\" a slow, measured twelve-bar blues piece with six choruses, demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. The choruses unfold as follows:\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound at the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and underscores several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece's climactic chorus, where the reeds commence the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique for a solo.\n\nEllington's use of voice to infuse the piece with an extra layer of tone color is a characteristic trait found throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing melds the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a staple in Ellington's orchestra, being employed effectively to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Ever since her mid-teens, she harbored an insatiable yearning for a certain something. This craving had not been quenched even after three years. At 17, she had resolved that she sought a person, not a possession, but no one had piqued her interest. Boys had attempted to woo her, but none had succeeded. She puzzled over this, but her contemplations yielded no satisfying explanations. Life went on, she questioned her desires, and she lived.\n\nHer home was typically tranquil, her parents being calm and harmonious. Arguments were rare, save for when she asserted her independence. Today, however, peace was disturbed. Walking through her rooms in search of inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. Her mother was on the floor, in obvious pain. \"Mom? What happened?\" she cried, rushing to her side. \"Take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. She gently lifted her mother and drove her to the hospital, her mind racing.\n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital filled her nostrils as she waited, anxiety gnawing at her. Her mother had been reaching for a vase when she fell off a step stool.",
            "Research has revealed that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternative Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a reduced likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, including stroke-related mortality. This modified Med diet emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with monounsaturated fats (preferring them over saturated fats), and fish, and decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Limited alcohol consumption is permitted as part of this diet.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and risks of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Furthermore, an intervention trial showcased the Med diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in those who are obese. However, prior studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, using the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort of 121,700 female nurses from 11 US states, followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, an aMed diet score was calculated from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs), which assess nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of participants maintained involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Missing records resulted in cases being classified as \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so categorized. Body mass index, smoking, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for random variations and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a significant economic downturn, characterized by a substantial rise in unemployment, a collapse in the housing sector, and the demise of numerous large corporations. This recession persists to this day, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? The crisis was engendered by a combination of self-serving political choices and an immature, insufficient financial framework. Under duress, financial institutions were coerced into providing sub-prime loans, while Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and package these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves lacking in capital reserves, leading to the ripple effect across the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this financial turmoil were sown during the Clinton presidency in 1999. In an effort to secure a second term, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis a decade later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted this outcome in 1999, noting that Fannie Mae, under pressure from the administration and shareholders, was being pushed to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals. Holmes foretold that the corporation might face similar difficulties as the savings and loan industry in the 1980s, which ultimately proved accurate.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the introduction of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments interwove various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leveraging. When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities were left in disarray. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, equating to approximately 30% of the USA’s GDP in 2007. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was liquidated, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to transition into heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the opening chapters. The part where you, as the author, soar with your literary quill, captivating your readers with a mesmerizing narrative. Or, the section where your audience starts yawning and clicking the \"Back\" button, muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin, herself, has been known to let out an exasperated sigh at her screen when faced with an excessive information dump, and not even the fun kind.\n\nExposition, to put it plainly, is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers, you are likely aware of the classic advice: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet, Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in lengthy passages where nothing of significance unfolds, or worse, where too much happens. Exposition is the mischievous sprite whispering in your ear to get the background out of the way to reach the exciting bits (not to be confused with the cunning imp urging you to share every single detail of your characters' pasts).\n\nExposition, in essence, is conveying information to the reader, often using straightforward language. In the realm of film, exposition occurs when a character recites a lengthy monologue to another, akin to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, the exposition is delivered by the author.\n\nConsider this: while reading a story, you learn that the protagonist encountered her love at a particular place and time, they were wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed before her very eyes. You would not anticipate this whole sequence to span two pages, during which they only utter a few lines each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, making his love for her evident through his words and actions. Similarly, the heroine should reflect his presence in her life, demonstrating how it transformed and enriched her (especially if the story later declares this to be true). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to empathize with his fate and gain insight into the heroine's personality: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and aspirations as seen through his lens, and more. You would mourn his demise with her, becoming more connected to her plight.\n\nIn brief, you must provide substance to the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they wed, he perished.\"\n\nAs a wordsmith, you must offer that substance. (*glances at the metaphor, sighs, presses on*) There are times when it is tempting to speed past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he served in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a convenience store, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys weekends spent fishing, secretly yearns for the day he owns the store, and had eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, aired live on August 13, 2011, was NBC 4. The headline focused on a man in Ashley, Ohio who allegedly stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was shown in a mugshot that suggested a sinister demeanor. The news segment was brief, covering the basics of the incident and the suspect's arrest. I found the coverage proportional, given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second report was about a shooting that occurred in the Sharon Woods area, injuring an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. The incident remained unsolved at the time, with an SWAT team conducting the investigation. This story was brief as well, which I believe might be due to the fact that the victim was a young black man from a minority neighborhood—in contrast to the often more extensive coverage given to similar incidents involving white victims. This disparity in media attention has been a recurring observation of mine.\n\nAnother story discussed the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, with details about the incident's location and the bullet's caliber, a .22 from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. I also noted a report about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay within the mid to low eightsies. This segment was brief but served to pique viewers' interest.\n\nThe next story involved a robbery at a convenience store on Clime Road, where a dark-skinned black man was said to have stolen items while wearing a hooded sweatshirt. Notably, the suspect's race was emphasized and his physical characteristics described in detail. This seemed disproportionately extensive compared to other descriptions.\n\nLastly, a story about convicted drug kingpin Rene Rodriguez was covered. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, the news report mentioned \"300 months.\" This phrasing was curious, as it sounded harsher than the actual sentence. The mention of his Hispanic ethnicity seemed unnecessary in relation to the story.",
            "The connection between siblings is profound, an unyielding and immutable bond. This alliance harbors a spectrum of feelings: adoration, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Siblings comprehend one another, far more than others, and can perceive themselves mirrored in their sibling's gaze. It is in the direst circumstances that this bond's essence is laid bare, whether in its benevolent or malevolent form. When these emotions surface, they exact a significant price. Part of comprehending the feelings engendered by this fraternal tie is grappling with their repercussions. When one gazes into their sibling's eye and sees their own reflection, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they genuinely are. Their actions and the outcomes they incur reveal their true self. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and its accompanying emotions. Amidst a lush, vividly depicted landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disillusionment collides with intense pride in the pivotal scene, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through explicit characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and their view of the world, both of which profoundly influence their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are epitomized by a singular emotion: pride. From their initial adventure together, to their final, fateful outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearns for a brother who could master all his worldly skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" He dreams of a brother who could accompany him on adventures like \"…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…\" Regrettably, these aspirations are dashed, as Doodle's frail heart makes it unlikely he will even survive, let alone participate in strenuous activities. This realization is a crushing blow to the protagonist, whose mind is steeped in fantastical dreams, and it sparks anger within him. He even contemplates suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, offering a glimmer of hope. This reveals that his malicious intent was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he harbors an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The mind, a labyrinthine, imaginative data manipulator, has seen its metaphorical parallels evolve with technological progress. From rudimentary to contemporary times, it has been likened to a wax tablet, a scroll of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into the intricacies of the brain, remember that these analogies maintain their utility but can lead to misconceptions. Information absorption begins with stimuli from the sensory organs, translating physical inputs like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into neurochemical signals. The brain's algorithms manipulate this data through both bottom-up and top-down approaches. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box on a white backdrop, bottom-up processing compiles simple cues such as color, angle, and border location to recognize the box. Top-down processing then refines this recognition, aiding in identifying it as a black box rather than a hole. This layered processing continues, with attention acting as a gatekeeper, deciding which data to prioritize. For example, while walking, your brain processes every blade of grass, yet a robust attention system prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, your name, even whispered in a noisy environment, stands out.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first retain it. Several memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded differently based on its type. Verbal input can be stored visually (structural), aurally (phonemic), or semantically (meaning). Once stored, it needs maintenance. Some studies suggest that working memory, with a brief retention time of about 20 seconds, is sustained by a short-lived electrical loop in specific neurons. Long-term memory is theorized to be maintained by certain protein structures. Various models exist on how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, linked based on relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" could be linked to \"table,\" which could be further linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley, through his dystopian novel Brave New World, critiques the impending menaces of technological advancement and the capitalist framework that upholds it. In this society, collective harmony is prioritized over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to prioritize instant satisfaction. Citizens are largely pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, who dictates ideological conformity. Analyzing the text through a Marxist lens highlights the author's reservations about the evolution of these systems. Concepts such as homogenization and reification underscore the flaws in the economic landscape of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned via Marxist principles, including false consciousness. The common populace remains oblivious to their economic realities, driven by personal gain rather than collective awareness. This is manipulated by the World Controller, who controls the consumption drive through hypnopædia. The lower classes, Delta and Gamma, for instance, lack self-determination, focused instead on indulgence. Hegemony, where one dominant class subjugates others, is evident here. The lower classes, unwittingly, embrace the ideology supporting capitalism and consumerism. Even the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, largely accept their positions. Interactions between individuals are superficial, mirroring shallow relationships. Emotions are curtailed, with conversations skewing towards physical attributes. The societal class structure's acceptance of their roles reflects Marxist views on the proletariat, content in their economic status as long as they consume and comply.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, which translates to about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, particularly for those who reside in East Halls, tucked away in the eastern corner of the campus. My freshman year, I was placed in a dorm room there, and trekking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations such as the Willard building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather wasn't cooperating. According to a former student around my age, the area around East Halls used to be vast open space, but it has since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments as the campus has expanded. As a result, commuting between points has become increasingly cumbersome. What's the most effective solution? I believe it's the bicycle. However, just having bikes won't solve the issue; the campus infrastructure must also accommodate cyclists.\n\nSpeaking with a friend who resumed cycling after a break, he expressed that bicycles are a convenient mode of transportation. \"They're great,\" he claimed, \"for a few years, riding a bike wasn't cool, but it's the fastest way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for health, bicycles offer an efficient means of travel, as one can cover 30 miles with a bowl of oatmeal and some effort. Currently, I live off-campus, equidistant from the center of the university as some dorms. My best decision this year was to purchase a bike. Instead of walking the 25-minute journey to Thomas building, I can now reach it in 5 minutes on a bike. However, the direct route via Pollock Road isn't always straightforward, making it challenging to traverse. While walking also has its merits, I find it impractical due to my busy schedule. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option, costing me an additional 30-40 minutes per day, which adds up to over two and a half hours weekly, besides the time spent commuting to other classes and appointments."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My aspiration to engage in the realm of social work is deeply rooted in my desire to assist vulnerable children who have experienced abuse or neglect, as well as to offer support to struggling families. The qualities I bring to this field encompass dedication, respect, and a strong ethical stance, all of which are integral not only to my professional life but also to my personal values.\n\nGrowing up, I witnessed numerous individuals retreat from confronting their issues, often employing suboptimal coping mechanisms. This compelled me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although uncertain about my career trajectory post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I decided to take some time to explore my options. During this period, I visited a friend whose young guest, a sixteen-year-old boy, was nervously perched on her couch. She shared that he was fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, I learned of his attempt to involve the authorities. Moved by his plight, I offered assistance and visited his parents’ residence, where I spoke with the police about my concerns. Despite their limited options, the police requested that I speak with the parents. Upon questioning, the parents appeared apprehensive and attributed their son's behavior to manipulative tendencies. This encounter sparked my serious consideration of a career in social work.\n\nAnother pivotal value in social work is the pursuit of social justice. Society often professes the importance of individuality but struggles to uphold this in practice. If we mourn individual losses, why do we strive for uniformity? I am an individual who values standing out and challenging societal norms. Throughout my academic journey, I've protested against injustice in various ways: coloring my hair unnaturally, donning clothing that reflected my personality, challenging traditional ear piercing norms, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and advocating against racism and discrimination. I am committed to a life dedicated to social justice and will continue to embody these principles in my future endeavors.",
            "This report delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The Biological model centers around genetic traits, inherited health aspects, and physiological factors. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines environmental influences and their impacts on various demographics, including race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review explores insomnia through the lens of these models, examining selected research pieces to elucidate each model. The research findings are then critically evaluated for their individual strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, secondary sleep disorders related to other mental conditions, or those resulting from medical issues or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias involve abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. Sleep disorders linked to mental conditions stem from Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders are due to medical complications or substance intake. The following review concentrates on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with a focus on their relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetics, inheritable factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons influence sleep/wake states. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be translated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype were inheritable, it could influence sleep, and alterations to the receptor could negatively affect daily life, including school, career, and tasks requiring focus.",
            "This document explores three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the condition is offered. Subsequently, the diagnosis process is detailed, including common indicators, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with guidance for educators in inclusive classrooms on supporting students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. More specifically, it involves the CNS's perceptual processing of audible data and the neurobiological activity underlying this processing, as reflected in electrophysiologic auditory responses (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process sounds accurately. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but experience difficulty deciphering or distinguishing between sounds.\n\nThe earliest known reference to CAPD, initially called \"auditory imperception\", dates back to the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered tests for children with communicative challenges in 1954. Kimura later introduced dichotic testing and developed a model for the physiological basis of dichotic perception in 1961. A national conference in 1977 further fueled research on CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD are diverse: individuals may struggle to pinpoint or hear sounds in space, differentiate between simultaneous sounds, recognize sound patterns, or detect changes in speech (like sarcasm). They may also struggle with blocking out sounds, synthesizing sound clues, or determining the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves assessing auditory function through systematic observation and performance on various tests. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists administer these tests, using diverse measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. No single tool guarantees consistent diagnostic success, and the causes of CAPD remain unknown. Common tests involve presenting multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking individuals to identify specific items, while advanced tests measure responses to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the theme of disguise and its consequences is a recurring motif. While masquerade can be a tool for deception, it is ultimately a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows one to escape the truth, but on the other, it can lead to a permanent loss of identity. The challenge lies in choosing between self-preservation and maintaining relationships. Disclosure can lead to alienation, and not all will respond with understanding or forgiveness.\n\nThe matter of deception in gender role reversal is particularly intricate. Why would someone adopt a disguise and assume the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's a survival mechanism, a way to protect herself. Arriving in a strange land, she dons male attire to safeguard her safety: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Yet, this masquerade isolates her from women, cutting her off from potential allies. Moreover, her convincing portrayal as a man causes Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138).\n\nDespite the intrigue, some might argue that this play serves as a catalyst for suppressed emotions. The characters' responses to Viola/Cesario, especially Olivia and Orsino, reveal hidden feelings. Orsino, for instance, struggles with his unexpressed desires: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). Olivia's swift shift from romantic interest to familial affection—“A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)—suggests a deeper, less superficial understanding.",
            "The grim legacy of German colonial rule is undeniably marked by its harsh treatment, most notably the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. The German colonial enterprise, however, cannot be reduced to such a singular narrative. It was a complex tapestry of varying policies and administrative styles, as varied as its geographical landscape. Educational initiatives across the colonies mirrored this diversity. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British found a sizable population of educated Africans, and contemporary accounts also commended German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa, now Namibia, starkly contrasted. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives through state schools, the task of educating the indigenous population in South West Africa was predominantly left to missionary societies with limited government backing. The colonial government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing a robust system of state schools and substantially supporting and regulating missionary institutions. These educational policies had profound and lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\" A myriad of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent educational experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular focus on recent research exploring the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous population.\n\nA plethora of literature exists on the topic of education within the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were penned in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily sought to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language texts expanded on this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as the most relevant to this paper. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and attributes many of the distinctions to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nUnlike other German colonies, South West Africa boasted a moderately temperate climate, with much of its landscape covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Over the course of a century, the categorization of Popular Music has expanded to encompass a multitude of genres, making a comprehensive list quite challenging. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nearly all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and beyond—have developed numerous sub- and sub-sub-genres within their domain. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most versatile and emotionally expressive genres in the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from the wide spectrum of emotions it embodies, often leaning towards darker sentiments. Diverse in nature, Heavy Metal quickly demonstrated its flexibility, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nIn modern Heavy Metal, the sheer number of niche groups has made it difficult to pinpoint precisely what constitutes the genre. It has adopted themes from numerous other genres, yet like all creative movements, it has its roots. To comprehend the Heavy Metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the Heavy Metal movement and why it exists as more than just a genre.\n\nMetal can be seen as a movement that embraces darkness. It is often characterized by increased intensity—more bass, louder volume, greater volatility, and theatricality. Musicians in Metal bands exhibit exceptional instrumental proficiency, which is evident in their music. Moreover, Metal is intrinsically linked to drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s fueled the creation of many innovative, otherworldly records, with musicians using drugs as a catalyst for their compositions. The genre's dark, visceral qualities were a striking departure from the more mainstream, less intense popular music of the time. Later generations of Metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify the darker emotional undertones that are a hallmark of the Metal movement. This song, considered by some to be one of the earliest Heavy Metal tracks, was a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones track. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to produce similarly intense music, resulting in a heavier sound for \"The White Album.\"",
            "Prior to the inception of Surrealism's dreamlike canvases, Henri Rousseau was already sculpting his own visions, both practically and spiritually. \"The Dream,\" his 1910 masterpiece, does not merely depict a woman in a trance amidst a dream landscape; it is a manifestation of Rousseau's personal aspirations and aspirations as an artist. From the outset, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, yet he faced an internal conflict: to adhere to or imitate existing artistic styles for acceptance, or to forge his own unique path. Analyzing \"The Dream\" through this lens necessitates an understanding of Rousseau's life story.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844. His father, a tinsmith and hardware merchant, enjoyed middle-class prosperity. With no formal art training, he worked as a customs inspector until the age of forty. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infants left him with only one daughter, Julia, and deep sorrow. He turned to painting for solace and new beginnings, unlike his contemporaries who often idealized the peasantry in their art. Instead, Rousseau was a folk artist with the hopes and dreams of a humble commoner.\n\nRousseau's longing for art world acceptance becomes clearer when considering his background: he was untrained, started late in life, and worked alongside many established, talented artists. Recognition only came around the time Matisse was gaining prominence. In \"Modern French Painters,\" author Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau sought to create a conventional work that would gain admission to the Artiste Français, showing their contrasting motivations and approaches.",
            "Numerous philosophical minds have posited that ethics and aesthetics share an intrinsic bond, with truth and beauty intertwined in a symbiotic dance. It strikes me as plausible that at a quintessential level, this union is not coincidental. As John Keats expounded in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our knowledge is predominantly shaped by education or life's experiences, it seems we derive appreciation for ethics and aesthetics in a more profound, less explicit manner. Both fields, in essence, seek to elucidate rather than dictate. Our exploration of virtue and beauty is largely an attempt to comprehend why certain art or action is deemed so, rather than a set of rules for judgement or creation. It's a conundrum: the scrutiny of art or morals often fails to encapsulate their essence. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance. Although discussions might revolve around techniques like perspective, contrast, or cultural relevance, these elements don't encapsulate why it's considered great. Instead, we often hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it\" preceding more detailed explanations. I propose that both art and morality possess this enigmatic quality, a je ne sais quoi that transcends description. Flannery O'Connor, in her wisdom, asserted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, morality defies complete articulation. Ludwig Wittgenstein's musings align: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This transcendental nature, this ineffable quality, is the most potent attribute of both art and morality, and it's this shared trait that fosters a connection between them. We experience morality and art most powerfully at a subliminal level, a Kantian noumenal realm where they touch our souls, yet elude full explanation. This connection is especially pronounced in literature, as McKean posits, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The contemporary Germany stands as a formidable power, a nation that bears a distinctive cultural identity, stretching from the shadowed heights of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic seashore of Kiel. This unique culture permeates cities like Cologne along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and into the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Given this rich cultural tapestry, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Germany today is the product of diverse influences and tribes.\n\nThe ancient homeland of the Germans, Germania, is shrouded in mystery regarding the origins of its name. Tacitus, a Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from the Tungri, a Germanic tribe who once crossed the Rhine and clashed with Gauls, although this assertion is debated. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, utilized the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine. The Gauls themselves might have imparted this name, or it could be traced to a spear in their language or the Old Irish term for 'shout', signifying the Germans' warlike nature (OED, 2010).\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous, untainted by foreign influence, as few would choose to migrate to Germania's harsh climate and lands. The Romans, too, primarily sent expeditions to Germany for resources and occasionally led land campaigns, but they generally returned to their vast empire (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17). As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the empire's fringes, trading goods and skills within the Roman army's ranks.",
            "I gazed down, my thoughts emptied and mind clear, at the sight before me. Unwavering, my consciousness assessed the scene, each detail carefully scrutinized but not understood. Thoughts darted in and out of my mind, swift and fluid, as if they were witnessing the scene vicariously rather than engaging with it. I had always aspired to capture the beauty of art with my hands, and a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" had been my guide. The book taught me to simplify complex scenes by framing them in a square, transforming a bustling kitchen into a simple bowl of fruit.\n\nHowever, as I stood there, the sight of the bowl was too much to process. The grandeur of artistic greats like Picasso and Monet was a stark contrast to the reality of my task. The beginnings of my artistic journey, I thought, had now been reduced to this: the mess in the toilet at Rite Aid.\n\nI picked up my rag, feet planted firmly, tie knotted tightly, and stared at the offending substance. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, then I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand like a glove. I dipped my hand into the bowl, my mind filled with the tranquility of a mother preparing Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "The alarming statistics reveal that adolescents behind the wheel are at a significant risk. A confluence of factors contributes to this stark fact, particularly the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not fully equipped to navigate the perils of driving. Naivety about driving, coupled with overconfidence, often leads to catastrophic outcomes, including fatal crashes, rollovers, and speeding incidents. The presence of peers in the vehicle exacerbates these risks, as evidenced by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center.\n\nIn attempts to bolster teen driver safety, many states, including California, have implemented provisional licenses that impose driving hour restrictions and restrictions on minor passengers. However, these measures are insufficient. The crux of the problem lies in the collective inability of young drivers to manage the inherent risks adequately. Experts suggest that even at 18, teens may not be fully prepared for the responsibilities of driving. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman indicates that adolescents up to the age of 19-20 often engage in thrill-seeking behaviors, which can translate into risky driving habits.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, a simple legislative solution could be proposed. Schools could offer early driver education classes, but no individual under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, contingent upon completing a certain number of practical driving hours, a common requirement in many states. By delaying full driver's license issuance until at least 19 years old, we can potentially reduce the prevalence of deadly accidents on our roads.\n\nThe proposed legislation isn't unprecedented, but it could significantly impact safety nationwide. If implemented, it would provide a uniform standard for teen drivers, addressing the issue of adolescent risk-taking and improving overall road safety.",
            "Sifting through the Library of Congress’s archive of antique Edison films, I chanced upon a collection of fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films primarily rely on artistic editing to create illusions. My analysis was centered around documenting the poetic elements common in most trick films and investigating the anomalous traits present in a few of the later ones. The majority of trick films from this era are confined to a static stage within a frontal proscenium, eschewing camera movement, and utilizing long and medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equates to one film. However, some films from the early 20th century dared to deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\nA striking characteristic shared by these trick films is their filming within a stationary interior set framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining fixed in position. This composition, deeply rooted in theatrical conventions and vaudeville magic acts, restricts figures to horizontal movements, with characters entering and exiting the frame without the camera following. Consider the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors move back and forth along the horizontal axis, exiting the frame without the camera tracking them.\nThis static composition also lends itself to predominantly long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all trick films in the Edison collection, echoing the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors remain in the middle ground, avoiding camera movements that would necessitate close-ups.\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot equals an entire film. This constraint limits their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also constrains their dramatic or narrative potential, with many focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with minimal storytelling. However, it's crucial to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot does not equate to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" may comprise several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Study The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) to see how the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film appears as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "In a region where the surname Taylor is of considerable renown, John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and fervent advocate for the Republican cause. His primary occupation as an agriculturalist, coupled with a short-lived foray into politics, shaped him into a steadfast exponent of personal liberties and government structure. His passionate commitment to agrarian pursuits served as the cornerstone for his perspectives on governance, influencing his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial framework.\n\nJohn Taylor, with considerable foresight, believed the United States held a singular chance to forge an optimal government system, unencumbered by indigenous traditions. He strongly held that the natural rights of individuals are interdependent and should lie beyond the purview of the government. He posited that the \"state of nature,\" where physical prowess and cunning ruled, would not be acceptable in a civilized society.\n\nTo cultivate this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent goodness and evil in human nature. He espoused a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is wielded by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalistic excess. He maintained that a government founded on such principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administrators' avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was inherent in human nature but only considered malevolent when it led to the detriment of the collective good. He saw the necessity of a good government to control man's natural evil, yet it should be closely supervised to prevent the infusion of corrupting principles.\n\nTaylor, along with many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, with no powers exceeding those explicitly outlined. Recognizing the potential despotism of a powerful Federal government, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, more explicitly describing the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "In revisiting Figure 17, a sharp decline in commuter log submissions was observed during the third month of the project. This was somewhat disconcerting, yet the reason remains elusive. The arrival of winter in a New England setting likely contributed to the drop, as it discourages commuting by bicycle or on foot. The end of the fall semester in December also plays a role, as students and faculty are preoccupied with final tasks, causing the commuter log to fall off the radar. Additionally, December signifies the beginning of the holiday season, leading to a one-month break for students and faculty, during which campus visits are not necessary. The resumption of classes in late January might also contribute to February's low log count. Naturally, projects like these often experience an initial surge followed by a gradual decline. To counteract this, a special challenge week, the \"Carpool Challenge,\" was implemented in March, which successfully boosted log submissions. The project faced two primary obstacles: the inherent appeal of driving one's car and the need to provide incentives to encourage alternative commuting methods. Various rewards, such as gift certificates to local businesses, were distributed. Larger prizes, like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, might have further boosted engagement. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but varying the offerings could have potentially increased participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mirror an index, commodity, or a basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund, along with the advantages of single stock ownership, such as selling short, buying on margin, and purchasing even a single share in any transaction. While these benefits are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than most mutual funds. However, they also come with a downside: a commission is charged for each trade, just as with stocks. Additionally, ETFs offer a broad range of funds, but it is prudent for smart investors to assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will investigate the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to ascertain if owning a single ETF approximates the benefits of holding a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether there are more optimal configurations of these same stocks that could yield a better Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo make our analysis manageable, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio consist solely of these ten stocks in the proportions established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations for Beta and return are presented in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it is evident that the return of a portfolio made up of just the top ten holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, indicating a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF. These preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, it is essential to verify if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" deemed one of his finest works, incorporates a curious reference to \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines 6 and 56. This term, traced back to Virgil, originally denoted an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world for the Greeks. While Virgil certainly employed the term, Poe's usage might also be attributed to a more contemporary source. Poe was deeply engrossed in German literature, a fact evident in his familiarity with Goethe's works, specifically his poem \"Mignon.\" Karl J. Arndt's analysis in \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights striking similarities between the two poems, suggesting Poe's imitation of Goethe. This connection becomes clearer when one considers the poem \"The King of Thule\" from Faust's second part, written by Goethe and later adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe's repeated use of \"Thulé\" in his writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" further underscores this linkage. The poem \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" mirroring the dark, lonely landscape and haunting imagery of Goethe's poem. The speaker's description of Thule, with its shrouded world and absence of color, echoes the despair of the King of Thule following his wife's death. Additionally, Poe's respect for Tennyson, who admired Goethe, likely exposed him to the latter's works through various reproductions after their initial publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could an injured patron of a grocery store, who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill, potentially secure punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice because he was made aware of the spill twice and neglected to address it for half an hour due to dining? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To sustain such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were deliberately harmful and showed a willful disregard for the probable consequences. Palmer could argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm given previous incidents but failed to remedy the situation. While the claim of malicious intent may not be irrefutable, it remains plausible given the history of slip-and-fall accidents in the store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, alerted his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on a dinner break and \"didn’t have the time\" to deal with the spill. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin of the same issue, and his response remained the same. By 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, resulting in a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five similar incidents had been reported in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we are assessing whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a non-contractual breach if the defendant's actions were \"oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, despicable conduct committed with a willful disregard for the safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "In the late summer of 2008, I participated in a course on Islamic studies at CBC, where the topic of Islam's hostility towards other religions sparked considerable debate. This discussion, now four years later, remains pertinent. The post-9/11 media landscape has seen a shift from a critical view of Islam and extremism to one of remarkable tolerance in the United States. For instance, the election of a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim heritage, would have been unthinkable in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to contradict my understanding of his character. Historical accounts suggest that Muhammad employed force to convert tribes to Islam, yet his biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble. People supposedly came to believe in his teachings on their own accord after he displayed humility.\n\nThere are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For example, the story of the multiplication of mutton and milk for forty men is reminiscent of Jesus' feeding of the five thousand. Such narratives suggest a deliberate attempt to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, who lived by his truths and miracles, rather than proving them. This dilution of Jesus' life and miracles is concerning, as it seems to appropriate his legacy.\n\nMany stories in the biography are presented as oral accounts through multiple intermediaries, which can undermine their credibility. They may intend to validate the narratives, but the use of third-party accounts makes them appear more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a pious, benevolent, and wise figure. However, historical accounts portray him as a powerful and assertive individual. Given this, it's intriguing to consider whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs held by Jesus during his mortal life did not endure in the evolution of Christian thought following his demise. A historical overview reveals a trajectory where Christianity has gradually drifted from its roots. The modern world exhibits an increasing consciousness and progressive inclination, with traditionalists maintaining their resistance to novel ideas, though they may not significantly influence the whole. Among Christians, there is an anticipated surge in historical consciousness. This awareness will fuel a desire to differentiate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the essence of the religion's founder. This process may take years or centuries, but it is unavoidable: a return to Christianity's original form is inevitable. A movement will emerge, systematically stripping away layers of doctrine, as if time itself is rewinding, until only the seeds Jesus planted remain. When this tide sweeps through America and Europe, it will inspire multitudes to emulate the practices of Jesus' era, and the church will stand as a beacon. However, as the theological clock reverses, the current proliferation of Christian diversity will give way to uniformity. Regional, denominational, and divisive differences will yield to commonalities. History is replete with such reversals. The Christian faith, once shunned and persecuted by the Roman Empire, later became its dominant religion. Likewise, America transitioned from racial oppression to racial leadership. The pending reversal in Christianity will unravel this history, seeking its source, and unifying belief and practice. This transformation will hinge on interpreting Jesus' words symbolically, not literally. Thus, what changes transpired since Jesus' life?\n\nA deep dive into history reveals that Judaism, Christianity's theological predecessor, was at the core by the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were integral components of this religion. The Jewish populace was not unified, encompassing groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common folk",
            "In \"The Jungle,\" Upton Sinclair elucidates the intrinsic nature of humanity as inherently egoistic and self-serving. Individuals prioritize their own well-being over others, particularly those they deem lower, in their pursuit of prosperity and success. Sinclair's novel exemplifies this through the owners and managers of vast factories. Their singular focus is on expanding their empire, unconcerned with collateral damage or the suffering they inflict. Sinclair's description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" signifies the extensive wreckage caused by their avarice. They are oblivious to the harm these factories impose, be it the toxic smog or the filth from the animal enclosures.\n\nMoreover, these managers and owners exhibit no regard for their workers' welfare. Their primary objective is to maximize profits, as evidenced by Sinclair's phrase, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subject employees to exorbitant hours and summarily dismiss them without compensation or support, exploiting the lack of protective laws or regulations during that time. The workers, trapped in this grim system, are likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Various authors employ distinct methods to cultivate a specific atmosphere or perspective in their readers towards significant themes. Fitzgerald, in his masterpiece \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs several of these techniques with notable efficacy. He frequently combines adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to foster a particular ambiance around key subjects. Additionally, he invests symbols with specific meanings and employs them to convey these same sentiments. Fitzgerald utilizes this strategy extensively with colors, most notably gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald ascribes significance to these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later employs these meanings to evoke a sense of familiarity or importance around crucial elements.\n\nWhite/gray represents uniformity, with white conveying a sense of elegance and social standing, and gray signifying age and faded prominence. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning early in the novel through repetitive use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently depicted in white attire, ranging from Daisy's “white girlhood” (19) to Jordan's “white dress” (45). Even minor characters, like the dog-seller, are described as “a gray old man” (27), reinforcing the association of gray with aging and faded importance. The valley of ashes is characterized by “gray cars” and “gray land” (23), further solidifying this connection.\n\nAfter establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify insignificance or mundanity around certain subjects. This technique first manifests in relation to Daisy. After a prolonged absence of significant color use, Daisy is described as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform, desired object to Gatsby. Fitzgerald reinforces this impression with multiple instances where Daisy is depicted in white attire, such as her “white dress” (115) before Tom and Gatsby's altercation, and her “gray haze of fur collar” (18).",
            "The region of San Diego County is renowned for its agricultural prowess, largely due to its warm, sunny climate. The area cultivates a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organically grown community-supported agriculture products is considerable within the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations boasting lengthy waitlists. Additionally, organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such an operation could provide multiple benefits, including taking advantage of government programs, enhancing wildlife habitats, and creating revenue streams through tours and educational programs.",
            "The influence of culture on negotiating dynamics is substantial. Defined as much by what it excludes as what it includes, culture is neither uniform nor singular. Generalizations like \"all Russians are unyielding\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify cultural nuances. A skilled negotiator should focus on understanding how a culture's values and attitudes can shape discussions at the table. When encountering foreign cultures, one naturally compares them to their own, which can guide the approach. Exploring a culture's history or uncovering its biases can aid comprehension. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, acceptance and working within its parameters, especially with a weaker position, is crucial. Even when negotiating on foreign turf, respecting local traditions and beliefs can smooth cultural obstacles and drive progress.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that culture isn't confined to national borders. A nation's corporate culture can vary widely. For example, some companies prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture reveals itself in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and attitudes toward employee philanthropy. American corporate culture alone demonstrates this diversity, with differences across regions and environments. Some cultures appear more uniform, but a deeper dive is necessary to uncover their intricacies.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally vital. If a culture values saving face or collective harmony, a negotiator will avoid public shaming. Conversely, cultures that prioritize tough bargaining may resist early settlements. Keeping these considerations in mind before negotiations begins is important. However, gaining personal insights about an opponent can also enhance the negotiation process.",
            "The text \"There is no God\" is uttered by the fool, as expounded in Psalm 14 and St. Anselm's argument. Thomas Aquinas, another notable figure, also adheres to this belief. To compare their respective arguments, we must assume they both uphold the existence of the God of the Bible. Disregarding a deity that differs from this specification would hinder the comparison, as their arguments are centered on this singular concept. Despite their individual merits, neither truly establishes a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, as presented, emphasizes the pursuit of understanding through faith, asserting that God's existence is inherent in our minds. While his reasoning can seem convoluted, his core premise is that God's proof is found within our own comprehension. This notion, often labeled as faith, disregards the need for external evidence.\n\nIn contrast, Aquinas argues for the existence of God through rational thought and empirical evidence, eschewing faith entirely. This approach could enhance Christian outreach by swaying potential converts through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments, each demonstrating God's logical necessity. For instance, if one is missing a puzzle piece, one can deduce its existence and features without seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, an individual who would later be recognized as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he chose to withdraw from worldly affairs, achieving enlightenment. The spiritual path he paved gave birth to Buddhism, which today stands as the most traditional branch, known as Theravada Buddhism. Now nearing its twenty-five-hundredth anniversary, the religion has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. Consider the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. This event involves both monks and laypeople, holding symbolic importance despite Buddha's teachings never mentioning such rituals. This dynamic evolution extends from superficial traditions to the very essence of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community—both monastic and lay—has adapted its core beliefs over time, a process influenced by internal and external factors, both those that aid and those that hinder.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently employed in this discussion. Here, internal forces refer to those stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often due to negative perceptions. Benign forces are those that do not intend to aid or harm, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will recur throughout this exploration.\n\nTo begin, let us delve into the fundamentals of Theravada Buddhism—its core doctrines. Buddhists find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, essentially the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts includes the Sutta Pitaka containing all Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka with its disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with its metaphysical components. These include concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognizing these leads to escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and thus ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, including five precepts for laypeople (no killing, no lying, no stealing, no misconduct, no intoxicants) and more for monks. The core doctrinal principle is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a prolonged rivalry that lasted for five decades, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry, as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145), reached its summit with the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the U.S. triumphed and annexed Texas and the Southwestern territories. Other skirmishes between these two nations also occurred, finally tapering off before the onset of World War I. The roots of this discord were complex, involving cultural, religious, and material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is a common phenomenon among neighboring nations. Shared borders often breed rivalries due to conflicting interests, as seen in the case of the U.S. and Mexico, and other similar historical rivalries (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41). Like Mexico and Cuba, these nations share geographical proximity to the U.S. and have historically been adversaries, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained cordial relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious tensions have historically fueled such rivalries, including that between the U.S. and Mexico. Frahm (2001, p. 86) observes that Americans' opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century mirrored their earlier aversion to Catholicism and monarchy. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry, much like the Cold War, was both ideological and competitive over vital interests. The mutual mistrust could be traced back to the historic animosity between the English and Spanish, which lingered as a barrier to friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. within this 57-year period. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, such as border raids and other frontier problems. Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes that these issues persisted until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders. The rivalry gradually subsided as Mexico's dependency on the U.S. became evident, and finally ended as U.S. ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, a sudden, unforeseen ailment struck me, rendering me unexpectedly incapacitated. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession as an anchor against the instability and uncertainty I felt as a child, driven by the belief that illness and the need for care would always be present. Yet, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I was drawn to nursing for the steady foundation it offered.\n\nAt 46, now, I find myself disabled, with little savings and no employment prospects. Life has become a daily battle, a relentless struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-respect. After fifteen years of relying on disability benefits, I have nothing left to call my own. The love and support from my family and a handful of friends have been my lifeline. When life's storms hit, it's humbling to realize how helpless one can feel, even with inner strength.\n\nMy experience teaches me that emergencies, both grand and minute, are inevitable. No matter how well-equipped or prepared one is, some challenges are simply too vast to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that Americans should not rely solely on ailing government systems, I advocate for a return to mutual trust and assistance, encouraging us to support one another rather than isolating ourselves. The spirit of our nation was not founded on rugged individualism but on compassion, respect, and shared resources.\n\nSo, while preparing is certainly wise, I urge you to also build connections in your community. Stock your disaster kit, equip yourself with first aid supplies and emergency rations, but also reach out to those around you. In times of crisis, we are stronger together than we are alone.",
            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there limitations or boundaries that shape the trajectory of evolutionary change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical terms even the simplest organic shapes.\" This sentiment persists today, though mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through developmental and evolutionary lenses (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation explores the interplay of mathematical modeling with ontogenetic and phylogenetic transformations in Prunum, complemented by experimental studies, to illuminate the underlying mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. X-radiographic images of Prunum species were utilized to quantify parameters that could model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). Hypothetical shell morphologies were created to interpret the range of possible morphological shifts in Prunum. These results are integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain deeper insights into macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a spiral-tube structure traversing through 360 degrees of space, with each turn of the shell called a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and the line separating each whorl is termed a suture. The largest whorl, the final whorl, is called the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the base is the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nTo count whorls, first observe the shell from the apical view to locate the first suture, then draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count whorls from this line, approximating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a progression of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced through the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted graphically and mathematically, allowing parameters to be varied and thus modifying the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has shown little improvement. While the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have been insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortcomings will be explored below, indicating a need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than focus solely on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen a rise in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this category includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in case of complications, contributing to the high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Improvements in this indicator are therefore somewhat deceptive, overshadowing the remaining work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by healthcare professionals. Data on postnatal care is incomplete but indicates low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%, but urban areas have higher rates (7%) compared to rural areas (2%), highlighting disparities in healthcare access. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with the poor facing greater challenges accessing healthcare, likely due to financial barriers.\n\nConsidering future steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most crucial question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific strategies or fortify the entire healthcare system, focusing on pre and postnatal care for mothers and children? While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, they may also lead to funding imbalances, draw human resources to better-funded areas, and result in duplicated and uncoordinated services.",
            "Victorian literature is distinguished by its intricate focus on details and its penchant for aristocratic themes. Two texts, however, diverge from this norm: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works incorporate an element of enigma and eccentricity, uncommon among their peers, which enriches the characters' personas and elucidates their motivations and emotions.\n\n“Amidst a flurry of bewildering and perplexing notions, they flooded his mind. He seemed to be still traversing the path with Sikes and Crackit, engaged in heated argument: the very words they uttered echoed in his ears; and when he snapped back to awareness, … he found himself conversing with them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the report of fire arms; and there erupted a cacophony of cries and shouts; lights danced before his eyes, and chaos reigned, as an unseen force hurriedly bore him away. Throughout these swift visions, an indistinct, unsettling awareness of discomfort lingered, gnawing at him unceasingly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these tales, the element of mystery is often woven through dream sequences or dreamlike states, each with its own unique content and purpose. In Oliver Twist, these anomalous occurrences frequently unearth insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his pain, and his comprehension of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences it anew, as if in a dream, as he unsuccessfully seeks assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events, his dire health, and the persistent discomfort, as well as his hallucinatory encounters with Sikes and Crackit. The shooting is overpowering; his senses are numbed, and he fails to notice the “unseen hand” bearing him away; he relives his despair, now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. Given this, the question arises: whose will brought about his misfortune? It certainly was not his own. This shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over any event's outcome, even when his life is at stake. An underlying sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, one might assume Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it began – and night descended upon him again; night so protracted, yet so fleeting; long in its dreadful silence and brief in its hurried hours.”",
            "Some time back, I engaged in an after-school program assisting young students. I endeavored to support them in their academic challenges, with a particular aptitude for English and reading. I was summoned by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, likely in the third or fourth grade, experiencing difficulties with reading. I soon noticed an unusual pattern: he could pronounce certain letters flawlessly while others left him baffled. Intrigued, I discovered that Adrian, despite his monolingual English, was struggling with the alphabet. This realization was a turning point, as his mother, who spoke only Spanish, revealed that Adrian's true impediment was not language proficiency but familiarity with the English alphabet.\n\nThis anecdote underscores the challenges posed by language barriers in education, especially in California. Even a child who speaks fluent English can face significant obstacles in reading due to a limited understanding of the alphabet. The solution, in Adrian's case, was straightforward: enhanced tutoring in English, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students with limited English, the path to proficiency is more intricate, demanding a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, for instance, could be beneficial for all students, not just those for whom Spanish is their first language. Research shows that these programs can boost academic performance. Yet, there's a misconception that these programs are wasteful and mainly advantageous to a minority. In reality, if implemented universally, these programs could benefit all students. How can we achieve this? Mandating all teachers to be bilingual isn't feasible, but we could certainly incorporate bilingual assistants or tutors into classrooms.",
            "The journey of spirituality is a path each individual traverses, influenced by familial narratives and personal introspection. Some embrace the teachings of organized religion, while others reject them, claiming a self-reliant understanding of existence. Regardless of the chosen path, the pursuit of spiritual understanding leaves an indelible mark on our identities. We search for illumination in darkness, seeking clarity amidst the shadows.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my father responded, eyes reflecting the rain's relentless descent as we sat on the porch, puffing away. The tin roof hissed above us, while the gutters gushed water around us. He was gaunt, his hair thinner than I recalled, as he stared into the rain. It was a look I'd seen before, both distant and reminiscent. I felt isolated, anxious, unable to voice my fears about his impending departure. I embraced him, pulled my chair closer, and gazed into the falling rain together.\n\nMy father left us in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his life but failed to alleviate his pain. I couldn't fathom the reasoning behind this delay, nor the divine architect who might have been responsible. In the hushed silence of the night, I offered no supplications. If a higher power existed, it seemed to have lost interest in my life.\n\nI'd chosen not to witness his transition. The image of my creator slowly ceasing to be was too much to bear. Instead, I clung to memories of his life, not his death. I was his sole child, understanding him better than any other. I knew he wouldn't wish for me to be a witness to his final moments. I curled up in my bed for three days, awaiting news of his passing. Ironically, no one bothered to inform me of his death. I was the last to know.",
            "The traditional Gothic Novel, as Ian Watt posits in his seminal work The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is an apparent oxymoron, a phrase that combines 'Old-New.' This literary mode has been subject to both severe criticism and high praise, often labeled as having no substantial depth, yet simultaneously lauded for its 'terrible sublime' quality. The inaugural Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, deftly weaves together themes of both 'ancient' and 'modern' romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre, and a new literary technique. Walpole employs 'old' theatrical elements and 'new' mimetic nature in 'modern' novels to present his 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, yet the term 'gothic' at the time of Otranto's publication was used to denote various peoples, styles, and eras, viewed as archaic or unsophisticated in contrast to 'modern' societal and literary advancements. The fusion of theatrical 'Gothic' elements and the new novel format, which offers a more personal glimpse into character psychology, is what has sustained Gothic's longevity, making it appear both obsolete and fresh to a reader distant in time. One quintessential Gothic theme is chivalry, the medieval ideal of knightly training, which the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, preserves and refines. Chivalry is pivotal to Gothic writers, embodying the classic knight as brave, honorable, and competent, a contrast to the perceived decline in societal morality. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil and facing unfair accusations, may have felt the supposed virtue of the Gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This is evident in his character Frederic, who exudes chivalric qualities: a prince, a sufferer, and a perceived victim of infidels, with exaggerated gallantry and courtesy, exemplifying the emerging Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain orchestration, a sequence of activities, involves the transport of goods from the point of customer request through the raw materials phase, production, and distribution until it reaches the customer. The concept of supply chain orchestration was introduced in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. Oliver described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customers' needs swiftly and effectively. Six crucial components constitute a supply chain: production, procurement, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase of the supply chain, forms its bedrock. Here, managers determine the 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' of production. To ascertain customer preferences, managers analyze market trends. Once the market's demands are understood, managers decide which products to manufacture and in what quantities. Subsequently, they select the most suitable production site, considering both volume and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction. After establishing the production location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Thorough planning is paramount in production, as any oversight can lead to significant time and monetary losses. For instance, I previously worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee attire to receiving shipments, was meticulously outlined in a process manual. This structured approach ensured smooth operations without directional ambiguity or confusion.\n\nThe second key component of supply chain orchestration is procurement. It involves strategic decisions to define a facility's core competencies and establish outsourcing partnerships. A single product might span multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, labor, and expertise. Managers must identify the most suitable division for each production process. Outsourcing work to external companies can enhance speed, quality, and flexibility while keeping costs low or maintaining cost-effective levels.",
            "On a bustling city street, a lone figure stands with a handmade sign, bearing an enigmatic message. The sign reads, \"Hitler lives in Burma.\" Burma, a nation in Southeast Asia, is governed by a repressive military regime that seized control in 1962, suppressing dissent until recent times. In 2007, a series of demonstrations, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted, led by monks and eventually joined by the public. Violent clashes ensued, with the military junta targeting monasteries and journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, who was killed in September 2007. Official reports of deaths stand at 13, but defecting Colonel Hla Win claims thousands more were killed. This is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, numerous regimes have sought to stifle dissent. Early emperors of Rome and Japan, and even the current U.S. President, have been accused of exercising undue power. Notable examples include the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where the death toll ranges from a few hundred to over 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias and the government systematically murdered Tutsis and moderates. Hitler's Third Reich is another infamous case, where Jews were systematically persecuted and killed across multiple countries.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on jazz can be attributed to his extensive career and his adeptness in directing his orchestra. Ellington's role on the piano, though often understated in the pieces chosen for this task, does not diminish his prowess as a composer. He excelled in crafting intricate and multifaceted compositions that spotlighted the unique talents of his band members. This ability to form a setting for soloists to freely improvise, alongside his skill in writing carefully arranged sections and phrases that called upon the distinctive styles of band members, allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra. By mastering the individual voices of his musicians and their interplay within the ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation with a reference to \"Creole Love Call,\" a piece where voice is used as a jazz instrument. This is an early instance of Ellington's use of voice to add nuance and color without the constraint of lyrics. \"Creole Love Call,\" a slow, measured twelve-bar blues piece with six choruses, demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. The choruses unfold as follows:\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound at the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and underscores several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece's climactic chorus, where the reeds commence the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique for a solo.\n\nEllington's use of voice to infuse the piece with an extra layer of tone color is a characteristic trait found throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing melds the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a staple in Ellington's orchestra, being employed effectively to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Ever since her mid-teens, she harbored an insatiable yearning for a certain something. This craving had not been quenched even after three years. At 17, she had resolved that she sought a person, not a possession, but no one had piqued her interest. Boys had attempted to woo her, but none had succeeded. She puzzled over this, but her contemplations yielded no satisfying explanations. Life went on, she questioned her desires, and she lived.\n\nHer home was typically tranquil, her parents being calm and harmonious. Arguments were rare, save for when she asserted her independence. Today, however, peace was disturbed. Walking through her rooms in search of inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. Her mother was on the floor, in obvious pain. \"Mom? What happened?\" she cried, rushing to her side. \"Take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. She gently lifted her mother and drove her to the hospital, her mind racing.\n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital filled her nostrils as she waited, anxiety gnawing at her. Her mother had been reaching for a vase when she fell off a step stool.",
            "Research has revealed that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternative Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a reduced likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, including stroke-related mortality. This modified Med diet emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with monounsaturated fats (preferring them over saturated fats), and fish, and decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Limited alcohol consumption is permitted as part of this diet.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and risks of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Furthermore, an intervention trial showcased the Med diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in those who are obese. However, prior studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, using the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort of 121,700 female nurses from 11 US states, followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, an aMed diet score was calculated from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs), which assess nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of participants maintained involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Missing records resulted in cases being classified as \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so categorized. Body mass index, smoking, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for random variations and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a significant economic downturn, characterized by a substantial rise in unemployment, a collapse in the housing sector, and the demise of numerous large corporations. This recession persists to this day, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? The crisis was engendered by a combination of self-serving political choices and an immature, insufficient financial framework. Under duress, financial institutions were coerced into providing sub-prime loans, while Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and package these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves lacking in capital reserves, leading to the ripple effect across the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this financial turmoil were sown during the Clinton presidency in 1999. In an effort to secure a second term, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis a decade later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted this outcome in 1999, noting that Fannie Mae, under pressure from the administration and shareholders, was being pushed to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals. Holmes foretold that the corporation might face similar difficulties as the savings and loan industry in the 1980s, which ultimately proved accurate.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the introduction of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments interwove various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leveraging. When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities were left in disarray. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, equating to approximately 30% of the USA’s GDP in 2007. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was liquidated, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to transition into heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the opening chapters. The part where you, as the author, soar with your literary quill, captivating your readers with a mesmerizing narrative. Or, the section where your audience starts yawning and clicking the \"Back\" button, muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin, herself, has been known to let out an exasperated sigh at her screen when faced with an excessive information dump, and not even the fun kind.\n\nExposition, to put it plainly, is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers, you are likely aware of the classic advice: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet, Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in lengthy passages where nothing of significance unfolds, or worse, where too much happens. Exposition is the mischievous sprite whispering in your ear to get the background out of the way to reach the exciting bits (not to be confused with the cunning imp urging you to share every single detail of your characters' pasts).\n\nExposition, in essence, is conveying information to the reader, often using straightforward language. In the realm of film, exposition occurs when a character recites a lengthy monologue to another, akin to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, the exposition is delivered by the author.\n\nConsider this: while reading a story, you learn that the protagonist encountered her love at a particular place and time, they were wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed before her very eyes. You would not anticipate this whole sequence to span two pages, during which they only utter a few lines each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, making his love for her evident through his words and actions. Similarly, the heroine should reflect his presence in her life, demonstrating how it transformed and enriched her (especially if the story later declares this to be true). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to empathize with his fate and gain insight into the heroine's personality: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and aspirations as seen through his lens, and more. You would mourn his demise with her, becoming more connected to her plight.\n\nIn brief, you must provide substance to the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they wed, he perished.\"\n\nAs a wordsmith, you must offer that substance. (*glances at the metaphor, sighs, presses on*) There are times when it is tempting to speed past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he served in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a convenience store, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys weekends spent fishing, secretly yearns for the day he owns the store, and had eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, aired live on August 13, 2011, was NBC 4. The headline focused on a man in Ashley, Ohio who allegedly stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was shown in a mugshot that suggested a sinister demeanor. The news segment was brief, covering the basics of the incident and the suspect's arrest. I found the coverage proportional, given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second report was about a shooting that occurred in the Sharon Woods area, injuring an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. The incident remained unsolved at the time, with an SWAT team conducting the investigation. This story was brief as well, which I believe might be due to the fact that the victim was a young black man from a minority neighborhood—in contrast to the often more extensive coverage given to similar incidents involving white victims. This disparity in media attention has been a recurring observation of mine.\n\nAnother story discussed the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, with details about the incident's location and the bullet's caliber, a .22 from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. I also noted a report about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay within the mid to low eightsies. This segment was brief but served to pique viewers' interest.\n\nThe next story involved a robbery at a convenience store on Clime Road, where a dark-skinned black man was said to have stolen items while wearing a hooded sweatshirt. Notably, the suspect's race was emphasized and his physical characteristics described in detail. This seemed disproportionately extensive compared to other descriptions.\n\nLastly, a story about convicted drug kingpin Rene Rodriguez was covered. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, the news report mentioned \"300 months.\" This phrasing was curious, as it sounded harsher than the actual sentence. The mention of his Hispanic ethnicity seemed unnecessary in relation to the story.",
            "The connection between siblings is profound, an unyielding and immutable bond. This alliance harbors a spectrum of feelings: adoration, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Siblings comprehend one another, far more than others, and can perceive themselves mirrored in their sibling's gaze. It is in the direst circumstances that this bond's essence is laid bare, whether in its benevolent or malevolent form. When these emotions surface, they exact a significant price. Part of comprehending the feelings engendered by this fraternal tie is grappling with their repercussions. When one gazes into their sibling's eye and sees their own reflection, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they genuinely are. Their actions and the outcomes they incur reveal their true self. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and its accompanying emotions. Amidst a lush, vividly depicted landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disillusionment collides with intense pride in the pivotal scene, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through explicit characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and their view of the world, both of which profoundly influence their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are epitomized by a singular emotion: pride. From their initial adventure together, to their final, fateful outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearns for a brother who could master all his worldly skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" He dreams of a brother who could accompany him on adventures like \"…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…\" Regrettably, these aspirations are dashed, as Doodle's frail heart makes it unlikely he will even survive, let alone participate in strenuous activities. This realization is a crushing blow to the protagonist, whose mind is steeped in fantastical dreams, and it sparks anger within him. He even contemplates suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, offering a glimmer of hope. This reveals that his malicious intent was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he harbors an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The mind, a labyrinthine, imaginative data manipulator, has seen its metaphorical parallels evolve with technological progress. From rudimentary to contemporary times, it has been likened to a wax tablet, a scroll of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into the intricacies of the brain, remember that these analogies maintain their utility but can lead to misconceptions. Information absorption begins with stimuli from the sensory organs, translating physical inputs like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into neurochemical signals. The brain's algorithms manipulate this data through both bottom-up and top-down approaches. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box on a white backdrop, bottom-up processing compiles simple cues such as color, angle, and border location to recognize the box. Top-down processing then refines this recognition, aiding in identifying it as a black box rather than a hole. This layered processing continues, with attention acting as a gatekeeper, deciding which data to prioritize. For example, while walking, your brain processes every blade of grass, yet a robust attention system prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, your name, even whispered in a noisy environment, stands out.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first retain it. Several memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded differently based on its type. Verbal input can be stored visually (structural), aurally (phonemic), or semantically (meaning). Once stored, it needs maintenance. Some studies suggest that working memory, with a brief retention time of about 20 seconds, is sustained by a short-lived electrical loop in specific neurons. Long-term memory is theorized to be maintained by certain protein structures. Various models exist on how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, linked based on relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" could be linked to \"table,\" which could be further linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley, through his dystopian novel Brave New World, critiques the impending menaces of technological advancement and the capitalist framework that upholds it. In this society, collective harmony is prioritized over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to prioritize instant satisfaction. Citizens are largely pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, who dictates ideological conformity. Analyzing the text through a Marxist lens highlights the author's reservations about the evolution of these systems. Concepts such as homogenization and reification underscore the flaws in the economic landscape of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned via Marxist principles, including false consciousness. The common populace remains oblivious to their economic realities, driven by personal gain rather than collective awareness. This is manipulated by the World Controller, who controls the consumption drive through hypnopædia. The lower classes, Delta and Gamma, for instance, lack self-determination, focused instead on indulgence. Hegemony, where one dominant class subjugates others, is evident here. The lower classes, unwittingly, embrace the ideology supporting capitalism and consumerism. Even the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, largely accept their positions. Interactions between individuals are superficial, mirroring shallow relationships. Emotions are curtailed, with conversations skewing towards physical attributes. The societal class structure's acceptance of their roles reflects Marxist views on the proletariat, content in their economic status as long as they consume and comply.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, which translates to about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, particularly for those who reside in East Halls, tucked away in the eastern corner of the campus. My freshman year, I was placed in a dorm room there, and trekking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations such as the Willard building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather wasn't cooperating. According to a former student around my age, the area around East Halls used to be vast open space, but it has since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments as the campus has expanded. As a result, commuting between points has become increasingly cumbersome. What's the most effective solution? I believe it's the bicycle. However, just having bikes won't solve the issue; the campus infrastructure must also accommodate cyclists.\n\nSpeaking with a friend who resumed cycling after a break, he expressed that bicycles are a convenient mode of transportation. \"They're great,\" he claimed, \"for a few years, riding a bike wasn't cool, but it's the fastest way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for health, bicycles offer an efficient means of travel, as one can cover 30 miles with a bowl of oatmeal and some effort. Currently, I live off-campus, equidistant from the center of the university as some dorms. My best decision this year was to purchase a bike. Instead of walking the 25-minute journey to Thomas building, I can now reach it in 5 minutes on a bike. However, the direct route via Pollock Road isn't always straightforward, making it challenging to traverse. While walking also has its merits, I find it impractical due to my busy schedule. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option, costing me an additional 30-40 minutes per day, which adds up to over two and a half hours weekly, besides the time spent commuting to other classes and appointments."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",

The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My aspiration to engage in the realm of social work is deeply rooted in my desire to assist vulnerable children who have experienced abuse or neglect, as well as to offer support to struggling families. The qualities I bring to this field encompass dedication, respect, and a strong ethical stance, all of which are integral not only to my professional life but also to my personal values.\n\nGrowing up, I witnessed numerous individuals retreat from confronting their issues, often employing suboptimal coping mechanisms. This compelled me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. Although uncertain about my career trajectory post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I decided to take some time to explore my options. During this period, I visited a friend whose young guest, a sixteen-year-old boy, was nervously perched on her couch. She shared that he was fleeing his abusive parents. The next day, I learned of his attempt to involve the authorities. Moved by his plight, I offered assistance and visited his parents’ residence, where I spoke with the police about my concerns. Despite their limited options, the police requested that I speak with the parents. Upon questioning, the parents appeared apprehensive and attributed their son's behavior to manipulative tendencies. This encounter sparked my serious consideration of a career in social work.\n\nAnother pivotal value in social work is the pursuit of social justice. Society often professes the importance of individuality but struggles to uphold this in practice. If we mourn individual losses, why do we strive for uniformity? I am an individual who values standing out and challenging societal norms. Throughout my academic journey, I've protested against injustice in various ways: coloring my hair unnaturally, donning clothing that reflected my personality, challenging traditional ear piercing norms, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and advocating against racism and discrimination. I am committed to a life dedicated to social justice and will continue to embody these principles in my future endeavors.",
            "This report delves into the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The Biological model centers around genetic traits, inherited health aspects, and physiological factors. The Sociocultural model, on the other hand, examines environmental influences and their impacts on various demographics, including race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review explores insomnia through the lens of these models, examining selected research pieces to elucidate each model. The research findings are then critically evaluated for their individual strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, secondary sleep disorders related to other mental conditions, or those resulting from medical issues or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias encompass difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep, while Parasomnias involve abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. Sleep disorders linked to mental conditions stem from Axis I or Axis II disorders. Other categories of sleep disorders are due to medical complications or substance intake. The following review concentrates on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with a focus on their relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetics, inheritable factors, and physiological aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons influence sleep/wake states. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be translated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor. A malfunction or absence of this receptor could disrupt sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype were inheritable, it could influence sleep, and alterations to the receptor could negatively affect daily life, including school, career, and tasks requiring focus.",
            "This document explores three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise definition of the condition is offered. Subsequently, the diagnosis process is detailed, including common indicators, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with guidance for educators in inclusive classrooms on supporting students with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. More specifically, it involves the CNS's perceptual processing of audible data and the neurobiological activity underlying this processing, as reflected in electrophysiologic auditory responses (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it is a disorder where the brain struggles to process sounds accurately. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but experience difficulty deciphering or distinguishing between sounds.\n\nThe earliest known reference to CAPD, initially called \"auditory imperception\", dates back to the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered tests for children with communicative challenges in 1954. Kimura later introduced dichotic testing and developed a model for the physiological basis of dichotic perception in 1961. A national conference in 1977 further fueled research on CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD are diverse: individuals may struggle to pinpoint or hear sounds in space, differentiate between simultaneous sounds, recognize sound patterns, or detect changes in speech (like sarcasm). They may also struggle with blocking out sounds, synthesizing sound clues, or determining the sequence of auditory information.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves assessing auditory function through systematic observation and performance on various tests. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists administer these tests, using diverse measures to evaluate auditory-related skills. No single tool guarantees consistent diagnostic success, and the causes of CAPD remain unknown. Common tests involve presenting multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and asking individuals to identify specific items, while advanced tests measure responses to acoustic signals within the ear.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the theme of disguise and its consequences is a recurring motif. While masquerade can be a tool for deception, it is ultimately a double-edged sword. On one hand, it allows one to escape the truth, but on the other, it can lead to a permanent loss of identity. The challenge lies in choosing between self-preservation and maintaining relationships. Disclosure can lead to alienation, and not all will respond with understanding or forgiveness.\n\nThe matter of deception in gender role reversal is particularly intricate. Why would someone adopt a disguise and assume the opposite gender? In Viola's case, it's a survival mechanism, a way to protect herself. Arriving in a strange land, she dons male attire to safeguard her safety: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249). Yet, this masquerade isolates her from women, cutting her off from potential allies. Moreover, her convincing portrayal as a man causes Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138).\n\nDespite the intrigue, some might argue that this play serves as a catalyst for suppressed emotions. The characters' responses to Viola/Cesario, especially Olivia and Orsino, reveal hidden feelings. Orsino, for instance, struggles with his unexpressed desires: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261). Olivia's swift shift from romantic interest to familial affection—“A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)—suggests a deeper, less superficial understanding.",
            "The grim legacy of German colonial rule is undeniably marked by its harsh treatment, most notably the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. The German colonial enterprise, however, cannot be reduced to such a singular narrative. It was a complex tapestry of varying policies and administrative styles, as varied as its geographical landscape. Educational initiatives across the colonies mirrored this diversity. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British found a sizable population of educated Africans, and contemporary accounts also commended German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies.\n\nThe situation in South West Africa, now Namibia, starkly contrasted. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in the education of natives through state schools, the task of educating the indigenous population in South West Africa was predominantly left to missionary societies with limited government backing. The colonial government, however, invested heavily in the education of Europeans, establishing a robust system of state schools and substantially supporting and regulating missionary institutions. These educational policies had profound and lasting impacts on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted substantial numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate.\" A myriad of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent educational experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, with a particular focus on recent research exploring the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous population.\n\nA plethora of literature exists on the topic of education within the German colonial empire. Most of these sources are in German and were penned in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the colonial period. Early works primarily sought to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language texts expanded on this discourse through comparative studies and more detailed analyses. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's study on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as the most relevant to this paper. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and attributes many of the distinctions to the large settler population in South West Africa.\n\nUnlike other German colonies, South West Africa boasted a moderately temperate climate, with much of its landscape covered by arid desert. This relatively hospitable environment attracted a significant European population. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa compared to only 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "Over the course of a century, the categorization of Popular Music has expanded to encompass a multitude of genres, making a comprehensive list quite challenging. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nearly all genres—rap, rock, country, jazz, folk, and beyond—have developed numerous sub- and sub-sub-genres within their domain. Among these, the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock stands out as one of the most versatile and emotionally expressive genres in the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from the wide spectrum of emotions it embodies, often leaning towards darker sentiments. Diverse in nature, Heavy Metal quickly demonstrated its flexibility, leading to the creation of various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a trend that continues to this day.\n\nIn modern Heavy Metal, the sheer number of niche groups has made it difficult to pinpoint precisely what constitutes the genre. It has adopted themes from numerous other genres, yet like all creative movements, it has its roots. To comprehend the Heavy Metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the Heavy Metal movement and why it exists as more than just a genre.\n\nMetal can be seen as a movement that embraces darkness. It is often characterized by increased intensity—more bass, louder volume, greater volatility, and theatricality. Musicians in Metal bands exhibit exceptional instrumental proficiency, which is evident in their music. Moreover, Metal is intrinsically linked to drug use. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-70s fueled the creation of many innovative, otherworldly records, with musicians using drugs as a catalyst for their compositions. The genre's dark, visceral qualities were a striking departure from the more mainstream, less intense popular music of the time. Later generations of Metal drew inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities of the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify the darker emotional undertones that are a hallmark of the Metal movement. This song, considered by some to be one of the earliest Heavy Metal tracks, was a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones track. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their ability to produce similarly intense music, resulting in a heavier sound for \"The White Album.\"",
            "Prior to the inception of Surrealism's dreamlike canvases, Henri Rousseau was already sculpting his own visions, both practically and spiritually. \"The Dream,\" his 1910 masterpiece, does not merely depict a woman in a trance amidst a dream landscape; it is a manifestation of Rousseau's personal aspirations and aspirations as an artist. From the outset, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, yet he faced an internal conflict: to adhere to or imitate existing artistic styles for acceptance, or to forge his own unique path. Analyzing \"The Dream\" through this lens necessitates an understanding of Rousseau's life story.\n\nHenri Rousseau was born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844. His father, a tinsmith and hardware merchant, enjoyed middle-class prosperity. With no formal art training, he worked as a customs inspector until the age of forty. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infants left him with only one daughter, Julia, and deep sorrow. He turned to painting for solace and new beginnings, unlike his contemporaries who often idealized the peasantry in their art. Instead, Rousseau was a folk artist with the hopes and dreams of a humble commoner.\n\nRousseau's longing for art world acceptance becomes clearer when considering his background: he was untrained, started late in life, and worked alongside many established, talented artists. Recognition only came around the time Matisse was gaining prominence. In \"Modern French Painters,\" author Jan Gordon notes that while Matisse feared painting in a clichéd manner, Rousseau sought to create a conventional work that would gain admission to the Artiste Français, showing their contrasting motivations and approaches.",
            "Numerous philosophical minds have posited that ethics and aesthetics share an intrinsic bond, with truth and beauty intertwined in a symbiotic dance. It strikes me as plausible that at a quintessential level, this union is not coincidental. As John Keats expounded in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our knowledge is predominantly shaped by education or life's experiences, it seems we derive appreciation for ethics and aesthetics in a more profound, less explicit manner. Both fields, in essence, seek to elucidate rather than dictate. Our exploration of virtue and beauty is largely an attempt to comprehend why certain art or action is deemed so, rather than a set of rules for judgement or creation. It's a conundrum: the scrutiny of art or morals often fails to encapsulate their essence. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance. Although discussions might revolve around techniques like perspective, contrast, or cultural relevance, these elements don't encapsulate why it's considered great. Instead, we often hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it\" preceding more detailed explanations. I propose that both art and morality possess this enigmatic quality, a je ne sais quoi that transcends description. Flannery O'Connor, in her wisdom, asserted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, morality defies complete articulation. Ludwig Wittgenstein's musings align: \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This transcendental nature, this ineffable quality, is the most potent attribute of both art and morality, and it's this shared trait that fosters a connection between them. We experience morality and art most powerfully at a subliminal level, a Kantian noumenal realm where they touch our souls, yet elude full explanation. This connection is especially pronounced in literature, as McKean posits, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The contemporary Germany stands as a formidable power, a nation that bears a distinctive cultural identity, stretching from the shadowed heights of the Alps in Munich to the Baltic seashore of Kiel. This unique culture permeates cities like Cologne along the Rhine River, through the heart of Germany, and into the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Given this rich cultural tapestry, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Germany today is the product of diverse influences and tribes.\n\nThe ancient homeland of the Germans, Germania, is shrouded in mystery regarding the origins of its name. Tacitus, a Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from the Tungri, a Germanic tribe who once crossed the Rhine and clashed with Gauls, although this assertion is debated. Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, utilized the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine. The Gauls themselves might have imparted this name, or it could be traced to a spear in their language or the Old Irish term for 'shout', signifying the Germans' warlike nature (OED, 2010).\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous, untainted by foreign influence, as few would choose to migrate to Germania's harsh climate and lands. The Romans, too, primarily sent expeditions to Germany for resources and occasionally led land campaigns, but they generally returned to their vast empire (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17). As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they resided on the empire's fringes, trading goods and skills within the Roman army's ranks.",
            "I gazed down, my thoughts emptied and mind clear, at the sight before me. Unwavering, my consciousness assessed the scene, each detail carefully scrutinized but not understood. Thoughts darted in and out of my mind, swift and fluid, as if they were witnessing the scene vicariously rather than engaging with it. I had always aspired to capture the beauty of art with my hands, and a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" had been my guide. The book taught me to simplify complex scenes by framing them in a square, transforming a bustling kitchen into a simple bowl of fruit.\n\nHowever, as I stood there, the sight of the bowl was too much to process. The grandeur of artistic greats like Picasso and Monet was a stark contrast to the reality of my task. The beginnings of my artistic journey, I thought, had now been reduced to this: the mess in the toilet at Rite Aid.\n\nI picked up my rag, feet planted firmly, tie knotted tightly, and stared at the offending substance. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet reflection, then I reached for the toilet paper, wrapping it around my hand like a glove. I dipped my hand into the bowl, my mind filled with the tranquility of a mother preparing Thanksgiving dinner.",
            "The alarming statistics reveal that adolescents behind the wheel are at a significant risk. A confluence of factors contributes to this stark fact, particularly the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not fully equipped to navigate the perils of driving. Naivety about driving, coupled with overconfidence, often leads to catastrophic outcomes, including fatal crashes, rollovers, and speeding incidents. The presence of peers in the vehicle exacerbates these risks, as evidenced by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center.\n\nIn attempts to bolster teen driver safety, many states, including California, have implemented provisional licenses that impose driving hour restrictions and restrictions on minor passengers. However, these measures are insufficient. The crux of the problem lies in the collective inability of young drivers to manage the inherent risks adequately. Experts suggest that even at 18, teens may not be fully prepared for the responsibilities of driving. Research by psychologist Marvin Zuckerman indicates that adolescents up to the age of 19-20 often engage in thrill-seeking behaviors, which can translate into risky driving habits.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, a simple legislative solution could be proposed. Schools could offer early driver education classes, but no individual under 18 should be allowed to operate a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, contingent upon completing a certain number of practical driving hours, a common requirement in many states. By delaying full driver's license issuance until at least 19 years old, we can potentially reduce the prevalence of deadly accidents on our roads.\n\nThe proposed legislation isn't unprecedented, but it could significantly impact safety nationwide. If implemented, it would provide a uniform standard for teen drivers, addressing the issue of adolescent risk-taking and improving overall road safety.",
            "Sifting through the Library of Congress’s archive of antique Edison films, I chanced upon a collection of fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films primarily rely on artistic editing to create illusions. My analysis was centered around documenting the poetic elements common in most trick films and investigating the anomalous traits present in a few of the later ones. The majority of trick films from this era are confined to a static stage within a frontal proscenium, eschewing camera movement, and utilizing long and medium shots, adhering to the rule that one shot equates to one film. However, some films from the early 20th century dared to deviate from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\nA striking characteristic shared by these trick films is their filming within a stationary interior set framed by a frontal proscenium, with the camera remaining fixed in position. This composition, deeply rooted in theatrical conventions and vaudeville magic acts, restricts figures to horizontal movements, with characters entering and exiting the frame without the camera following. Consider the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors move back and forth along the horizontal axis, exiting the frame without the camera tracking them.\nThis static composition also lends itself to predominantly long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from all trick films in the Edison collection, echoing the theatrical tradition where audiences viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage borders. Actors remain in the middle ground, avoiding camera movements that would necessitate close-ups.\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot equals an entire film. This constraint limits their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frames per second. It also constrains their dramatic or narrative potential, with many focusing on brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic and disappearing acts with minimal storytelling. However, it's crucial to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot does not equate to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" may comprise several joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Study The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) to see how the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the film appears as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "In a region where the surname Taylor is of considerable renown, John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and fervent advocate for the Republican cause. His primary occupation as an agriculturalist, coupled with a short-lived foray into politics, shaped him into a steadfast exponent of personal liberties and government structure. His passionate commitment to agrarian pursuits served as the cornerstone for his perspectives on governance, influencing his views on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and even the judicial framework.\n\nJohn Taylor, with considerable foresight, believed the United States held a singular chance to forge an optimal government system, unencumbered by indigenous traditions. He strongly held that the natural rights of individuals are interdependent and should lie beyond the purview of the government. He posited that the \"state of nature,\" where physical prowess and cunning ruled, would not be acceptable in a civilized society.\n\nTo cultivate this ideal society, Taylor believed a government must acknowledge the inherent goodness and evil in human nature. He espoused a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is wielded by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalistic excess. He maintained that a government founded on such principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administrators' avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, was inherent in human nature but only considered malevolent when it led to the detriment of the collective good. He saw the necessity of a good government to control man's natural evil, yet it should be closely supervised to prevent the infusion of corrupting principles.\n\nTaylor, along with many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, with no powers exceeding those explicitly outlined. Recognizing the potential despotism of a powerful Federal government, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation. He viewed the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, more explicitly describing the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "In revisiting Figure 17, a sharp decline in commuter log submissions was observed during the third month of the project. This was somewhat disconcerting, yet the reason remains elusive. The arrival of winter in a New England setting likely contributed to the drop, as it discourages commuting by bicycle or on foot. The end of the fall semester in December also plays a role, as students and faculty are preoccupied with final tasks, causing the commuter log to fall off the radar. Additionally, December signifies the beginning of the holiday season, leading to a one-month break for students and faculty, during which campus visits are not necessary. The resumption of classes in late January might also contribute to February's low log count. Naturally, projects like these often experience an initial surge followed by a gradual decline. To counteract this, a special challenge week, the \"Carpool Challenge,\" was implemented in March, which successfully boosted log submissions. The project faced two primary obstacles: the inherent appeal of driving one's car and the need to provide incentives to encourage alternative commuting methods. Various rewards, such as gift certificates to local businesses, were distributed. Larger prizes, like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, might have further boosted engagement. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project, but varying the offerings could have potentially increased participation.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument designed to mirror an index, commodity, or a basket of assets, similar to an index fund, but with the added flexibility of trading like a stock on an exchange. An ETF offers the diversification benefits of an index fund, along with the advantages of single stock ownership, such as selling short, buying on margin, and purchasing even a single share in any transaction. While these benefits are appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios than most mutual funds. However, they also come with a downside: a commission is charged for each trade, just as with stocks. Additionally, ETFs offer a broad range of funds, but it is prudent for smart investors to assess whether the touted benefits, like diversification, genuinely exist and to what degree. In this analysis, we will investigate the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to ascertain if owning a single ETF approximates the benefits of holding a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks, and whether there are more optimal configurations of these same stocks that could yield a better Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nTo make our analysis manageable, we will focus on the top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF overall, we can use their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and Return, should the portfolio consist solely of these ten stocks in the proportions established by the ETF's holdings. The calculations for Beta and return are presented in the following chart.\n\nFrom the chart, it is evident that the return of a portfolio made up of just the top ten holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, indicating a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF. These preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could offer higher returns with a lower Beta. However, it is essential to verify if the means of these two portfolios are statistically different.\n\nTo determine whether these portfolios are statistically different, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" deemed one of his finest works, incorporates a curious reference to \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines 6 and 56. This term, traced back to Virgil, originally denoted an island north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world for the Greeks. While Virgil certainly employed the term, Poe's usage might also be attributed to a more contemporary source. Poe was deeply engrossed in German literature, a fact evident in his familiarity with Goethe's works, specifically his poem \"Mignon.\" Karl J. Arndt's analysis in \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights striking similarities between the two poems, suggesting Poe's imitation of Goethe. This connection becomes clearer when one considers the poem \"The King of Thule\" from Faust's second part, written by Goethe and later adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe's repeated use of \"Thulé\" in his writings, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land,\" further underscores this linkage. The poem \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" mirroring the dark, lonely landscape and haunting imagery of Goethe's poem. The speaker's description of Thule, with its shrouded world and absence of color, echoes the despair of the King of Thule following his wife's death. Additionally, Poe's respect for Tennyson, who admired Goethe, likely exposed him to the latter's works through various reproductions after their initial publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could an injured patron of a grocery store, who slipped and fell on an applesauce spill, potentially secure punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with malice because he was made aware of the spill twice and neglected to address it for half an hour due to dining? A judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s claim for punitive damages. To sustain such a claim, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were deliberately harmful and showed a willful disregard for the probable consequences. Palmer could argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm given previous incidents but failed to remedy the situation. While the claim of malicious intent may not be irrefutable, it remains plausible given the history of slip-and-fall accidents in the store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, alerted his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on a dinner break and \"didn’t have the time\" to deal with the spill. At 5:15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, informed Martin of the same issue, and his response remained the same. By 5:30 pm, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, resulting in a serious back injury. Before Palmer’s accident, five similar incidents had been reported in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we are assessing whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a non-contractual breach if the defendant's actions were \"oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, despicable conduct committed with a willful disregard for the safety of others. Courts have deemed conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "In the late summer of 2008, I participated in a course on Islamic studies at CBC, where the topic of Islam's hostility towards other religions sparked considerable debate. This discussion, now four years later, remains pertinent. The post-9/11 media landscape has seen a shift from a critical view of Islam and extremism to one of remarkable tolerance in the United States. For instance, the election of a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim heritage, would have been unthinkable in 2001.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography has always intrigued me, as it seems to contradict my understanding of his character. Historical accounts suggest that Muhammad employed force to convert tribes to Islam, yet his biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and humble. People supposedly came to believe in his teachings on their own accord after he displayed humility.\n\nThere are striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For example, the story of the multiplication of mutton and milk for forty men is reminiscent of Jesus' feeding of the five thousand. Such narratives suggest a deliberate attempt to depict Muhammad as a humble prophet, who lived by his truths and miracles, rather than proving them. This dilution of Jesus' life and miracles is concerning, as it seems to appropriate his legacy.\n\nMany stories in the biography are presented as oral accounts through multiple intermediaries, which can undermine their credibility. They may intend to validate the narratives, but the use of third-party accounts makes them appear more dubious.\n\nWhat troubles me most about this work is its attempt to elevate Muhammad as a pious, benevolent, and wise figure. However, historical accounts portray him as a powerful and assertive individual. Given this, it's intriguing to consider whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the true history behind Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and beliefs held by Jesus during his mortal life did not endure in the evolution of Christian thought following his demise. A historical overview reveals a trajectory where Christianity has gradually drifted from its roots. The modern world exhibits an increasing consciousness and progressive inclination, with traditionalists maintaining their resistance to novel ideas, though they may not significantly influence the whole. Among Christians, there is an anticipated surge in historical consciousness. This awareness will fuel a desire to differentiate the doctrines added to Christianity over time from the essence of the religion's founder. This process may take years or centuries, but it is unavoidable: a return to Christianity's original form is inevitable. A movement will emerge, systematically stripping away layers of doctrine, as if time itself is rewinding, until only the seeds Jesus planted remain. When this tide sweeps through America and Europe, it will inspire multitudes to emulate the practices of Jesus' era, and the church will stand as a beacon. However, as the theological clock reverses, the current proliferation of Christian diversity will give way to uniformity. Regional, denominational, and divisive differences will yield to commonalities. History is replete with such reversals. The Christian faith, once shunned and persecuted by the Roman Empire, later became its dominant religion. Likewise, America transitioned from racial oppression to racial leadership. The pending reversal in Christianity will unravel this history, seeking its source, and unifying belief and practice. This transformation will hinge on interpreting Jesus' words symbolically, not literally. Thus, what changes transpired since Jesus' life?\n\nA deep dive into history reveals that Judaism, Christianity's theological predecessor, was at the core by the time Rome took control of Jerusalem in 63 BCE. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were integral components of this religion. The Jewish populace was not unified, encompassing groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and a majority of common folk",
            "In \"The Jungle,\" Upton Sinclair elucidates the intrinsic nature of humanity as inherently egoistic and self-serving. Individuals prioritize their own well-being over others, particularly those they deem lower, in their pursuit of prosperity and success. Sinclair's novel exemplifies this through the owners and managers of vast factories. Their singular focus is on expanding their empire, unconcerned with collateral damage or the suffering they inflict. Sinclair's description, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" signifies the extensive wreckage caused by their avarice. They are oblivious to the harm these factories impose, be it the toxic smog or the filth from the animal enclosures.\n\nMoreover, these managers and owners exhibit no regard for their workers' welfare. Their primary objective is to maximize profits, as evidenced by Sinclair's phrase, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" They subject employees to exorbitant hours and summarily dismiss them without compensation or support, exploiting the lack of protective laws or regulations during that time. The workers, trapped in this grim system, are likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Various authors employ distinct methods to cultivate a specific atmosphere or perspective in their readers towards significant themes. Fitzgerald, in his masterpiece \"The Great Gatsby,\" employs several of these techniques with notable efficacy. He frequently combines adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to foster a particular ambiance around key subjects. Additionally, he invests symbols with specific meanings and employs them to convey these same sentiments. Fitzgerald utilizes this strategy extensively with colors, most notably gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald ascribes significance to these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, and later employs these meanings to evoke a sense of familiarity or importance around crucial elements.\n\nWhite/gray represents uniformity, with white conveying a sense of elegance and social standing, and gray signifying age and faded prominence. Fitzgerald establishes this meaning early in the novel through repetitive use of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently depicted in white attire, ranging from Daisy's “white girlhood” (19) to Jordan's “white dress” (45). Even minor characters, like the dog-seller, are described as “a gray old man” (27), reinforcing the association of gray with aging and faded importance. The valley of ashes is characterized by “gray cars” and “gray land” (23), further solidifying this connection.\n\nAfter establishing these associations, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to signify insignificance or mundanity around certain subjects. This technique first manifests in relation to Daisy. After a prolonged absence of significant color use, Daisy is described as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster” (74), making her seem less like a character and more like a uniform, desired object to Gatsby. Fitzgerald reinforces this impression with multiple instances where Daisy is depicted in white attire, such as her “white dress” (115) before Tom and Gatsby's altercation, and her “gray haze of fur collar” (18).",
            "The region of San Diego County is renowned for its agricultural prowess, largely due to its warm, sunny climate. The area cultivates a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organically grown community-supported agriculture products is considerable within the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations boasting lengthy waitlists. Additionally, organic eggs and milk are in high demand. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such an operation could provide multiple benefits, including taking advantage of government programs, enhancing wildlife habitats, and creating revenue streams through tours and educational programs.",
            "The influence of culture on negotiating dynamics is substantial. Defined as much by what it excludes as what it includes, culture is neither uniform nor singular. Generalizations like \"all Russians are unyielding\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify cultural nuances. A skilled negotiator should focus on understanding how a culture's values and attitudes can shape discussions at the table. When encountering foreign cultures, one naturally compares them to their own, which can guide the approach. Exploring a culture's history or uncovering its biases can aid comprehension. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, acceptance and working within its parameters, especially with a weaker position, is crucial. Even when negotiating on foreign turf, respecting local traditions and beliefs can smooth cultural obstacles and drive progress.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that culture isn't confined to national borders. A nation's corporate culture can vary widely. For example, some companies prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more flexible schedule. Corporate culture reveals itself in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and attitudes toward employee philanthropy. American corporate culture alone demonstrates this diversity, with differences across regions and environments. Some cultures appear more uniform, but a deeper dive is necessary to uncover their intricacies.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally vital. If a culture values saving face or collective harmony, a negotiator will avoid public shaming. Conversely, cultures that prioritize tough bargaining may resist early settlements. Keeping these considerations in mind before negotiations begins is important. However, gaining personal insights about an opponent can also enhance the negotiation process.",
            "The text \"There is no God\" is uttered by the fool, as expounded in Psalm 14 and St. Anselm's argument. Thomas Aquinas, another notable figure, also adheres to this belief. To compare their respective arguments, we must assume they both uphold the existence of the God of the Bible. Disregarding a deity that differs from this specification would hinder the comparison, as their arguments are centered on this singular concept. Despite their individual merits, neither truly establishes a comprehensive basis for belief in God.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument, as presented, emphasizes the pursuit of understanding through faith, asserting that God's existence is inherent in our minds. While his reasoning can seem convoluted, his core premise is that God's proof is found within our own comprehension. This notion, often labeled as faith, disregards the need for external evidence.\n\nIn contrast, Aquinas argues for the existence of God through rational thought and empirical evidence, eschewing faith entirely. This approach could enhance Christian outreach by swaying potential converts through logic alone. Aquinas presents five logical arguments, each demonstrating God's logical necessity. For instance, if one is missing a puzzle piece, one can deduce its existence and features without seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, around the fifth or sixth century BCE, an individual who would later be recognized as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he chose to withdraw from worldly affairs, achieving enlightenment. The spiritual path he paved gave birth to Buddhism, which today stands as the most traditional branch, known as Theravada Buddhism. Now nearing its twenty-five-hundredth anniversary, the religion has evolved significantly since Buddha's time. Consider the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is celebrated. This event involves both monks and laypeople, holding symbolic importance despite Buddha's teachings never mentioning such rituals. This dynamic evolution extends from superficial traditions to the very essence of the faith. The Theravada Buddhist community—both monastic and lay—has adapted its core beliefs over time, a process influenced by internal and external factors, both those that aid and those that hinder.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently employed in this discussion. Here, internal forces refer to those stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while external forces come from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, often due to negative perceptions. Benign forces are those that do not intend to aid or harm, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will recur throughout this exploration.\n\nTo begin, let us delve into the fundamentals of Theravada Buddhism—its core doctrines. Buddhists find solace in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, essentially the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts includes the Sutta Pitaka containing all Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka with its disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka with its metaphysical components. These include concepts like Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognizing these leads to escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and thus ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth rules for life, including five precepts for laypeople (no killing, no lying, no stealing, no misconduct, no intoxicants) and more for monks. The core doctrinal principle is the four noble truths: life is suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes suffering, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico experienced a prolonged rivalry that lasted for five decades, from 1836 to 1893. This rivalry, as noted by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145), reached its summit with the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the U.S. triumphed and annexed Texas and the Southwestern territories. Other skirmishes between these two nations also occurred, finally tapering off before the onset of World War I. The roots of this discord were complex, involving cultural, religious, and material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis is a common phenomenon among neighboring nations. Shared borders often breed rivalries due to conflicting interests, as seen in the case of the U.S. and Mexico, and other similar historical rivalries (Pletcher, 1977, p. 41). Like Mexico and Cuba, these nations share geographical proximity to the U.S. and have historically been adversaries, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained cordial relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious tensions have historically fueled such rivalries, including that between the U.S. and Mexico. Frahm (2001, p. 86) observes that Americans' opposition to fascism and communism in the 20th century mirrored their earlier aversion to Catholicism and monarchy. The U.S.-Mexico rivalry, much like the Cold War, was both ideological and competitive over vital interests. The mutual mistrust could be traced back to the historic animosity between the English and Spanish, which lingered as a barrier to friendly diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes between Mexico and the U.S. within this 57-year period. Most of these disputes revolved around territorial issues, such as border raids and other frontier problems. Schmitt (1974, p. 97) notes that these issues persisted until both nations deployed military forces to secure their borders. The rivalry gradually subsided as Mexico's dependency on the U.S. became evident, and finally ended as U.S. ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, a sudden, unforeseen ailment struck me, rendering me unexpectedly incapacitated. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession as an anchor against the instability and uncertainty I felt as a child, driven by the belief that illness and the need for care would always be present. Yet, despite my dream of becoming a scientist or journalist, I was drawn to nursing for the steady foundation it offered.\n\nAt 46, now, I find myself disabled, with little savings and no employment prospects. Life has become a daily battle, a relentless struggle to maintain my security, safety, and self-respect. After fifteen years of relying on disability benefits, I have nothing left to call my own. The love and support from my family and a handful of friends have been my lifeline. When life's storms hit, it's humbling to realize how helpless one can feel, even with inner strength.\n\nMy experience teaches me that emergencies, both grand and minute, are inevitable. No matter how well-equipped or prepared one is, some challenges are simply too vast to face alone.\n\nWhile I agree that Americans should not rely solely on ailing government systems, I advocate for a return to mutual trust and assistance, encouraging us to support one another rather than isolating ourselves. The spirit of our nation was not founded on rugged individualism but on compassion, respect, and shared resources.\n\nSo, while preparing is certainly wise, I urge you to also build connections in your community. Stock your disaster kit, equip yourself with first aid supplies and emergency rations, but also reach out to those around you. In times of crisis, we are stronger together than we are alone.",
            "Why do creatures evolve as they do? Are there limitations or boundaries that shape the trajectory of evolutionary change? In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson remarked that \"even now, the zoologist has scarcely begun to dream of defining in mathematical terms even the simplest organic shapes.\" This sentiment persists today, though mathematical modeling has been applied to various aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through developmental and evolutionary lenses (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our investigation explores the interplay of mathematical modeling with ontogenetic and phylogenetic transformations in Prunum, complemented by experimental studies, to illuminate the underlying mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change. X-radiographic images of Prunum species were utilized to quantify parameters that could model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995). Hypothetical shell morphologies were created to interpret the range of possible morphological shifts in Prunum. These results are integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain deeper insights into macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a spiral-tube structure traversing through 360 degrees of space, with each turn of the shell called a whorl, which spirals around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and the line separating each whorl is termed a suture. The largest whorl, the final whorl, is called the body whorl. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, while the base is the opposite end. The animal exits the shell through an opening known as the aperture.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation of a shell is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upward.\n\nTo count whorls, first observe the shell from the apical view to locate the first suture, then draw a line dividing the shell into two parts. Count whorls from this line, approximating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be seen as a progression of apertures moving through time and space as the animal builds its shell. The path of the aperture can be traced through the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be depicted graphically and mathematically, allowing parameters to be varied and thus modifying the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Over the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has shown little improvement. While the nation is progressing towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have been insufficient to meet the 2015 targets. The reasons for these shortcomings will be explored below, indicating a need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than focus solely on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen a rise in births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this category includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions in case of complications, contributing to the high number of maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Improvements in this indicator are therefore somewhat deceptive, overshadowing the remaining work to be done. Additionally, there has been a decrease in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by healthcare professionals. Data on postnatal care is incomplete but indicates low rates across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain low, at around 4%, but urban areas have higher rates (7%) compared to rural areas (2%), highlighting disparities in healthcare access. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, with the poor facing greater challenges accessing healthcare, likely due to financial barriers.\n\nConsidering future steps to enhance neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most crucial question is how to best address the lack of services. Should Indonesia adopt program-specific strategies or fortify the entire healthcare system, focusing on pre and postnatal care for mothers and children? While programmatic approaches offer targeted and manageable objectives and faster results, they may also lead to funding imbalances, draw human resources to better-funded areas, and result in duplicated and uncoordinated services.",
            "Victorian literature is distinguished by its intricate focus on details and its penchant for aristocratic themes. Two texts, however, diverge from this norm: Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works incorporate an element of enigma and eccentricity, uncommon among their peers, which enriches the characters' personas and elucidates their motivations and emotions.\n\n“Amidst a flurry of bewildering and perplexing notions, they flooded his mind. He seemed to be still traversing the path with Sikes and Crackit, engaged in heated argument: the very words they uttered echoed in his ears; and when he snapped back to awareness, … he found himself conversing with them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the report of fire arms; and there erupted a cacophony of cries and shouts; lights danced before his eyes, and chaos reigned, as an unseen force hurriedly bore him away. Throughout these swift visions, an indistinct, unsettling awareness of discomfort lingered, gnawing at him unceasingly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nIn these tales, the element of mystery is often woven through dream sequences or dreamlike states, each with its own unique content and purpose. In Oliver Twist, these anomalous occurrences frequently unearth insights into Oliver's inner turmoil, his pain, and his comprehension of the true nature of his surroundings. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he experiences it anew, as if in a dream, as he unsuccessfully seeks assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events, his dire health, and the persistent discomfort, as well as his hallucinatory encounters with Sikes and Crackit. The shooting is overpowering; his senses are numbed, and he fails to notice the “unseen hand” bearing him away; he relives his despair, now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. Given this, the question arises: whose will brought about his misfortune? It certainly was not his own. This shooting underscores Oliver's lack of control over any event's outcome, even when his life is at stake. An underlying sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied, as if old Fagin has begun to break him, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, one might assume Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it began – and night descended upon him again; night so protracted, yet so fleeting; long in its dreadful silence and brief in its hurried hours.”",
            "Some time back, I engaged in an after-school program assisting young students. I endeavored to support them in their academic challenges, with a particular aptitude for English and reading. I was summoned by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, likely in the third or fourth grade, experiencing difficulties with reading. I soon noticed an unusual pattern: he could pronounce certain letters flawlessly while others left him baffled. Intrigued, I discovered that Adrian, despite his monolingual English, was struggling with the alphabet. This realization was a turning point, as his mother, who spoke only Spanish, revealed that Adrian's true impediment was not language proficiency but familiarity with the English alphabet.\n\nThis anecdote underscores the challenges posed by language barriers in education, especially in California. Even a child who speaks fluent English can face significant obstacles in reading due to a limited understanding of the alphabet. The solution, in Adrian's case, was straightforward: enhanced tutoring in English, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students with limited English, the path to proficiency is more intricate, demanding a multifaceted approach.\n\nThe dual language system, for instance, could be beneficial for all students, not just those for whom Spanish is their first language. Research shows that these programs can boost academic performance. Yet, there's a misconception that these programs are wasteful and mainly advantageous to a minority. In reality, if implemented universally, these programs could benefit all students. How can we achieve this? Mandating all teachers to be bilingual isn't feasible, but we could certainly incorporate bilingual assistants or tutors into classrooms.",
            "The journey of spirituality is a path each individual traverses, influenced by familial narratives and personal introspection. Some embrace the teachings of organized religion, while others reject them, claiming a self-reliant understanding of existence. Regardless of the chosen path, the pursuit of spiritual understanding leaves an indelible mark on our identities. We search for illumination in darkness, seeking clarity amidst the shadows.\n\n\"Cardinals,\" my father responded, eyes reflecting the rain's relentless descent as we sat on the porch, puffing away. The tin roof hissed above us, while the gutters gushed water around us. He was gaunt, his hair thinner than I recalled, as he stared into the rain. It was a look I'd seen before, both distant and reminiscent. I felt isolated, anxious, unable to voice my fears about his impending departure. I embraced him, pulled my chair closer, and gazed into the falling rain together.\n\nMy father left us in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The treatments had prolonged his life but failed to alleviate his pain. I couldn't fathom the reasoning behind this delay, nor the divine architect who might have been responsible. In the hushed silence of the night, I offered no supplications. If a higher power existed, it seemed to have lost interest in my life.\n\nI'd chosen not to witness his transition. The image of my creator slowly ceasing to be was too much to bear. Instead, I clung to memories of his life, not his death. I was his sole child, understanding him better than any other. I knew he wouldn't wish for me to be a witness to his final moments. I curled up in my bed for three days, awaiting news of his passing. Ironically, no one bothered to inform me of his death. I was the last to know.",
            "The traditional Gothic Novel, as Ian Watt posits in his seminal work The Rise of the Gothic Novel, is an apparent oxymoron, a phrase that combines 'Old-New.' This literary mode has been subject to both severe criticism and high praise, often labeled as having no substantial depth, yet simultaneously lauded for its 'terrible sublime' quality. The inaugural Gothic Novel, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, deftly weaves together themes of both 'ancient' and 'modern' romances to birth the proto-Gothic genre, and a new literary technique. Walpole employs 'old' theatrical elements and 'new' mimetic nature in 'modern' novels to present his 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, yet the term 'gothic' at the time of Otranto's publication was used to denote various peoples, styles, and eras, viewed as archaic or unsophisticated in contrast to 'modern' societal and literary advancements. The fusion of theatrical 'Gothic' elements and the new novel format, which offers a more personal glimpse into character psychology, is what has sustained Gothic's longevity, making it appear both obsolete and fresh to a reader distant in time. One quintessential Gothic theme is chivalry, the medieval ideal of knightly training, which the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, preserves and refines. Chivalry is pivotal to Gothic writers, embodying the classic knight as brave, honorable, and competent, a contrast to the perceived decline in societal morality. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil and facing unfair accusations, may have felt the supposed virtue of the Gothic era had been lost in contemporary society. This is evident in his character Frederic, who exudes chivalric qualities: a prince, a sufferer, and a perceived victim of infidels, with exaggerated gallantry and courtesy, exemplifying the emerging Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "Supply chain orchestration, a sequence of activities, involves the transport of goods from the point of customer request through the raw materials phase, production, and distribution until it reaches the customer. The concept of supply chain orchestration was introduced in 1982 by a consultant named Keith Oliver. Oliver described the entire process of planning, implementing, and controlling the supply chain to meet customers' needs swiftly and effectively. Six crucial components constitute a supply chain: production, procurement, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business leaders leverage these components to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial phase of the supply chain, forms its bedrock. Here, managers determine the 'when', 'why', 'where', and 'how' of production. To ascertain customer preferences, managers analyze market trends. Once the market's demands are understood, managers decide which products to manufacture and in what quantities. Subsequently, they select the most suitable production site, considering both volume and quality requirements, while ensuring customer satisfaction. After establishing the production location, managers focus on scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance. Thorough planning is paramount in production, as any oversight can lead to significant time and monetary losses. For instance, I previously worked at Wal-Mart and Target, where every aspect of the business, from employee attire to receiving shipments, was meticulously outlined in a process manual. This structured approach ensured smooth operations without directional ambiguity or confusion.\n\nThe second key component of supply chain orchestration is procurement. It involves strategic decisions to define a facility's core competencies and establish outsourcing partnerships. A single product might span multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, labor, and expertise. Managers must identify the most suitable division for each production process. Outsourcing work to external companies can enhance speed, quality, and flexibility while keeping costs low or maintaining cost-effective levels.",
            "On a bustling city street, a lone figure stands with a handmade sign, bearing an enigmatic message. The sign reads, \"Hitler lives in Burma.\" Burma, a nation in Southeast Asia, is governed by a repressive military regime that seized control in 1962, suppressing dissent until recent times. In 2007, a series of demonstrations, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" erupted, led by monks and eventually joined by the public. Violent clashes ensued, with the military junta targeting monasteries and journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, who was killed in September 2007. Official reports of deaths stand at 13, but defecting Colonel Hla Win claims thousands more were killed. This is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, numerous regimes have sought to stifle dissent. Early emperors of Rome and Japan, and even the current U.S. President, have been accused of exercising undue power. Notable examples include the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where the death toll ranges from a few hundred to over 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias and the government systematically murdered Tutsis and moderates. Hitler's Third Reich is another infamous case, where Jews were systematically persecuted and killed across multiple countries.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on jazz can be attributed to his extensive career and his adeptness in directing his orchestra. Ellington's role on the piano, though often understated in the pieces chosen for this task, does not diminish his prowess as a composer. He excelled in crafting intricate and multifaceted compositions that spotlighted the unique talents of his band members. This ability to form a setting for soloists to freely improvise, alongside his skill in writing carefully arranged sections and phrases that called upon the distinctive styles of band members, allowed him to emphasize the overall tone of the orchestra. By mastering the individual voices of his musicians and their interplay within the ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most innovative and remarkable works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's sound and innovation with a reference to \"Creole Love Call,\" a piece where voice is used as a jazz instrument. This is an early instance of Ellington's use of voice to add nuance and color without the constraint of lyrics. \"Creole Love Call,\" a slow, measured twelve-bar blues piece with six choruses, demonstrates Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. The choruses unfold as follows:\nChorus 1: A call and response between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic voice that transitions to a rougher sound at the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and underscores several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: The full band mirrors the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The piece's climactic chorus, where the reeds commence the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with a call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique for a solo.\n\nEllington's use of voice to infuse the piece with an extra layer of tone color is a characteristic trait found throughout his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill in tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing melds the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further develops these ideas, with Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a staple in Ellington's orchestra, being employed effectively to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "Ever since her mid-teens, she harbored an insatiable yearning for a certain something. This craving had not been quenched even after three years. At 17, she had resolved that she sought a person, not a possession, but no one had piqued her interest. Boys had attempted to woo her, but none had succeeded. She puzzled over this, but her contemplations yielded no satisfying explanations. Life went on, she questioned her desires, and she lived.\n\nHer home was typically tranquil, her parents being calm and harmonious. Arguments were rare, save for when she asserted her independence. Today, however, peace was disturbed. Walking through her rooms in search of inspiration, she heard a cry from the kitchen. Her mother was on the floor, in obvious pain. \"Mom? What happened?\" she cried, rushing to her side. \"Take me to the hospital,\" her mother gasped. She gently lifted her mother and drove her to the hospital, her mind racing.\n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital filled her nostrils as she waited, anxiety gnawing at her. Her mother had been reaching for a vase when she fell off a step stool.",
            "Research has revealed that sticking to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternative Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed), is linked to a reduced likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, including stroke-related mortality. This modified Med diet emphasizes increased consumption of plant-based foods, excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, along with monounsaturated fats (preferring them over saturated fats), and fish, and decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Limited alcohol consumption is permitted as part of this diet.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and risks of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Furthermore, an intervention trial showcased the Med diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in those who are obese. However, prior studies did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study, using the Nurses' Health Study, a large cohort of 121,700 female nurses from 11 US states, followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, without a history of CVD or diabetes. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, an aMed diet score was calculated from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (FFQs), which assess nutrient intake over the previous year. Over 95% of participants maintained involvement throughout the 20-year period. FFQs were validated, and reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical or hospital records, autopsies, or death certificates. Missing records resulted in cases being classified as \"probable\" and included, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so categorized. Body mass index, smoking, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and from 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo account for random variations and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the relationship between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal cases.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (including fatal CHD and strokes combined) were observed. Women in the top aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the United States experienced a significant economic downturn, characterized by a substantial rise in unemployment, a collapse in the housing sector, and the demise of numerous large corporations. This recession persists to this day, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can it be prevented? The crisis was engendered by a combination of self-serving political choices and an immature, insufficient financial framework. Under duress, financial institutions were coerced into providing sub-prime loans, while Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwrite and package these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves lacking in capital reserves, leading to the ripple effect across the repackaged mortgages and the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this financial turmoil were sown during the Clinton presidency in 1999. In an effort to secure a second term, the Clinton administration eased lending restrictions, paving the way for the sub-prime crisis a decade later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted this outcome in 1999, noting that Fannie Mae, under pressure from the administration and shareholders, was being pushed to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals. Holmes foretold that the corporation might face similar difficulties as the savings and loan industry in the 1980s, which ultimately proved accurate.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the introduction of complex mortgage structures such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments interwove various sectors of the economy with the housing market, leading to excessive leveraging. When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities were left in disarray. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts, equating to approximately 30% of the USA’s GDP in 2007. Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at bargain prices, Lehman Brothers was liquidated, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to transition into heavily regulated commercial banks. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the opening chapters. The part where you, as the author, soar with your literary quill, captivating your readers with a mesmerizing narrative. Or, the section where your audience starts yawning and clicking the \"Back\" button, muttering curses under their breath. Dr. Merlin, herself, has been known to let out an exasperated sigh at her screen when faced with an excessive information dump, and not even the fun kind.\n\nExposition, to put it plainly, is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers, you are likely aware of the classic advice: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet, Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in lengthy passages where nothing of significance unfolds, or worse, where too much happens. Exposition is the mischievous sprite whispering in your ear to get the background out of the way to reach the exciting bits (not to be confused with the cunning imp urging you to share every single detail of your characters' pasts).\n\nExposition, in essence, is conveying information to the reader, often using straightforward language. In the realm of film, exposition occurs when a character recites a lengthy monologue to another, akin to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, the exposition is delivered by the author.\n\nConsider this: while reading a story, you learn that the protagonist encountered her love at a particular place and time, they were wed in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed before her very eyes. You would not anticipate this whole sequence to span two pages, during which they only utter a few lines each. You would expect the author to delve into the husband's character, making his love for her evident through his words and actions. Similarly, the heroine should reflect his presence in her life, demonstrating how it transformed and enriched her (especially if the story later declares this to be true). A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to empathize with his fate and gain insight into the heroine's personality: what she saw in him, the depth of their bond, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and aspirations as seen through his lens, and more. You would mourn his demise with her, becoming more connected to her plight.\n\nIn brief, you must provide substance to the bare bones of the plot: \"They met, they wed, he perished.\"\n\nAs a wordsmith, you must offer that substance. (*glances at the metaphor, sighs, presses on*) There are times when it is tempting to speed past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he served in the Air Force, now works the night shift at a convenience store, has been married twice, has no children, enjoys weekends spent fishing, secretly yearns for the day he owns the store, and had eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, aired live on August 13, 2011, was NBC 4. The headline focused on a man in Ashley, Ohio who allegedly stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was shown in a mugshot that suggested a sinister demeanor. The news segment was brief, covering the basics of the incident and the suspect's arrest. I found the coverage proportional, given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second report was about a shooting that occurred in the Sharon Woods area, injuring an 18-year-old named Travis Buyers. The incident remained unsolved at the time, with an SWAT team conducting the investigation. This story was brief as well, which I believe might be due to the fact that the victim was a young black man from a minority neighborhood—in contrast to the often more extensive coverage given to similar incidents involving white victims. This disparity in media attention has been a recurring observation of mine.\n\nAnother story discussed the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, with details about the incident's location and the bullet's caliber, a .22 from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest. I also noted a report about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to stay within the mid to low eightsies. This segment was brief but served to pique viewers' interest.\n\nThe next story involved a robbery at a convenience store on Clime Road, where a dark-skinned black man was said to have stolen items while wearing a hooded sweatshirt. Notably, the suspect's race was emphasized and his physical characteristics described in detail. This seemed disproportionately extensive compared to other descriptions.\n\nLastly, a story about convicted drug kingpin Rene Rodriguez was covered. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute marijuana in large quantities from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, the news report mentioned \"300 months.\" This phrasing was curious, as it sounded harsher than the actual sentence. The mention of his Hispanic ethnicity seemed unnecessary in relation to the story.",
            "The connection between siblings is profound, an unyielding and immutable bond. This alliance harbors a spectrum of feelings: adoration, pride, envy, and malice, to name but a few. Siblings comprehend one another, far more than others, and can perceive themselves mirrored in their sibling's gaze. It is in the direst circumstances that this bond's essence is laid bare, whether in its benevolent or malevolent form. When these emotions surface, they exact a significant price. Part of comprehending the feelings engendered by this fraternal tie is grappling with their repercussions. When one gazes into their sibling's eye and sees their own reflection, they see themselves not as others perceive them, but as they genuinely are. Their actions and the outcomes they incur reveal their true self. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme and its accompanying emotions. Amidst a lush, vividly depicted landscape, these two boys embark on a futile journey. Bitter disillusionment collides with intense pride in the pivotal scene, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through explicit characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and their view of the world, both of which profoundly influence their actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are epitomized by a singular emotion: pride. From their initial adventure together, to their final, fateful outing, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearns for a brother who could master all his worldly skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" He dreams of a brother who could accompany him on adventures like \"…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…\" Regrettably, these aspirations are dashed, as Doodle's frail heart makes it unlikely he will even survive, let alone participate in strenuous activities. This realization is a crushing blow to the protagonist, whose mind is steeped in fantastical dreams, and it sparks anger within him. He even contemplates suffocating Doodle with a pillow. Yet, his heart softens when Doodle smiles at him, offering a glimmer of hope. This reveals that his malicious intent was not deeply rooted. Deep down, he harbors an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The mind, a labyrinthine, imaginative data manipulator, has seen its metaphorical parallels evolve with technological progress. From rudimentary to contemporary times, it has been likened to a wax tablet, a scroll of papyrus, a book, and most recently, a computer. As you delve into the intricacies of the brain, remember that these analogies maintain their utility but can lead to misconceptions. Information absorption begins with stimuli from the sensory organs, translating physical inputs like touch, heat, sound waves, or light particles into neurochemical signals. The brain's algorithms manipulate this data through both bottom-up and top-down approaches. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box on a white backdrop, bottom-up processing compiles simple cues such as color, angle, and border location to recognize the box. Top-down processing then refines this recognition, aiding in identifying it as a black box rather than a hole. This layered processing continues, with attention acting as a gatekeeper, deciding which data to prioritize. For example, while walking, your brain processes every blade of grass, yet a robust attention system prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, your name, even whispered in a noisy environment, stands out.\n\nTo process information, the brain must first retain it. Several memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Information is encoded differently based on its type. Verbal input can be stored visually (structural), aurally (phonemic), or semantically (meaning). Once stored, it needs maintenance. Some studies suggest that working memory, with a brief retention time of about 20 seconds, is sustained by a short-lived electrical loop in specific neurons. Long-term memory is theorized to be maintained by certain protein structures. Various models exist on how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as nodes, linked based on relatedness. For example, in such a network, \"chair\" could be linked to \"table,\" which could be further linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley, through his dystopian novel Brave New World, critiques the impending menaces of technological advancement and the capitalist framework that upholds it. In this society, collective harmony is prioritized over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to prioritize instant satisfaction. Citizens are largely pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, who dictates ideological conformity. Analyzing the text through a Marxist lens highlights the author's reservations about the evolution of these systems. Concepts such as homogenization and reification underscore the flaws in the economic landscape of Huxley's era.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned via Marxist principles, including false consciousness. The common populace remains oblivious to their economic realities, driven by personal gain rather than collective awareness. This is manipulated by the World Controller, who controls the consumption drive through hypnopædia. The lower classes, Delta and Gamma, for instance, lack self-determination, focused instead on indulgence. Hegemony, where one dominant class subjugates others, is evident here. The lower classes, unwittingly, embrace the ideology supporting capitalism and consumerism. Even the upper classes, such as Alphas and Betas, largely accept their positions. Interactions between individuals are superficial, mirroring shallow relationships. Emotions are curtailed, with conversations skewing towards physical attributes. The societal class structure's acceptance of their roles reflects Marxist views on the proletariat, content in their economic status as long as they consume and comply.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, which translates to about four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, particularly for those who reside in East Halls, tucked away in the eastern corner of the campus. My freshman year, I was placed in a dorm room there, and trekking from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in distant locations such as the Willard building could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially when the weather wasn't cooperating. According to a former student around my age, the area around East Halls used to be vast open space, but it has since been filled with sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services, and apartments as the campus has expanded. As a result, commuting between points has become increasingly cumbersome. What's the most effective solution? I believe it's the bicycle. However, just having bikes won't solve the issue; the campus infrastructure must also accommodate cyclists.\n\nSpeaking with a friend who resumed cycling after a break, he expressed that bicycles are a convenient mode of transportation. \"They're great,\" he claimed, \"for a few years, riding a bike wasn't cool, but it's the fastest way to get around.\" Besides being beneficial for health, bicycles offer an efficient means of travel, as one can cover 30 miles with a bowl of oatmeal and some effort. Currently, I live off-campus, equidistant from the center of the university as some dorms. My best decision this year was to purchase a bike. Instead of walking the 25-minute journey to Thomas building, I can now reach it in 5 minutes on a bike. However, the direct route via Pollock Road isn't always straightforward, making it challenging to traverse. While walking also has its merits, I find it impractical due to my busy schedule. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option, costing me an additional 30-40 minutes per day, which adds up to over two and a half hours weekly, besides the time spent commuting to other classes and appointments."
