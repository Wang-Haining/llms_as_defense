            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my quest to pursue an education in the social work discipline, my ambition is to follow a career trajectory within the Division of Family and Children Services. The principal objective is to offer assistance to children who have endured abuse or neglect, and to extend support to troubled families. The values I can contribute to the social work field encompass service, respect for others, an ethical demeanor, a commitment to fostering stronger relationships between individuals, and a dedication to continuous professional growth to maintain competence in the field. These core values are not merely crucial to social workers; they are deeply ingrained in my personal being.\n\nThroughout my academic journey in high school and college, I have observed numerous individuals retreating from their problems through denial and embracing coping strategies that were suboptimal. These experiences have steered me towards pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, though I was still undecided about my future career path after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009. Taking a sabbatical after college, I visited a friend one summer. She introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who seemed anxious on her couch. She explained why he was there — to flee his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents' residence. Out of a desire to assist, I drove over to his parents' house. I discussed my concerns with the police, who asked me to speak with the parents since they were powerless to intervene legally. The parents appeared anxious and attributed their son's \"manipulative\" behavior for reaching out to outsiders to resolve \"trivial\" disagreements. This encounter sparked a serious consideration of a career in social work to assist children grappling with family disputes.\n\nMoreover, another value integral to social work is social justice. Society often asserts the importance of the individual and mourns those lost. Yet, the concept of the \"individual\" society holds is often a reflection of outdated traditions rather than unique qualities. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to conform to \"everyone else?\" I am an individual who rejects self-imposed limitations to fit societal norms. My high school and college years were marked by protests against social injustice: unnatural hair colors, distinctive clothing choices, multiple ear piercings beyond the norm, involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and advocating against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This essay delves into the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The Biological model centers around genetic traits and health conditions, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors and their connection to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This analysis explores these models, highlighting key research pieces that relate to and elucidate them. Each study's findings are then critically evaluated for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into Primary Sleep Disorders, Sleep Disorders linked to other mental conditions, or Sleep Disorders linked to medical issues or substance intake. Primary Sleep Disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, each present distinct challenges, such as difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder, involve unusual behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. Sleep issues related to mental disorders can stem from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and other primary sleep disorders as they relate to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetics, inheritance, and physiological aspects. Orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, which directly influence sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAergic system promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The use of a GABA agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in the study. This suggests that human sleep patterns may be influenced by similar genetic and environmental factors. A defective or absent receptor could disrupt sleep without medication, potentially impacting daily life and productivity.",
            "This composition delves into three primary facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise description of the disorder is offered. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is detailed, encompassing common indicators, also known as \"red flags\". Finally, the paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in an inclusive classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. In simpler terms, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process sounds it hears, despite normal hearing. Individuals with CAPD can hear clearly but face challenges in separating words or discerning speech from background noise.\n\nThe roots of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered diagnostic tools for children with communication disorders in 1954. Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and his model for the physiology of the central nervous system underlying dichotic perception in 1961 further advanced the field. A pivotal national conference in 1977 stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include difficulties in localizing sounds, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, discerning changes in speech, and synthesizing sound clues. In diagnosing CAPD, a systematic observation of the patient's listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests is crucial. While there is no single diagnostic test with high success rates, and no known cause for the disorder, various methods are employed to evaluate auditory-related skills. These typically involve questionnaires, observations, and tests that present multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli.",
            "In the play \"Twelfth Night,\" it appears that while disguise can serve as a means to perpetuate prolonged deception, ultimately, one must shed this new persona or risk losing oneself indefinitely. One significant hurdle in ending a deceptive ruse, however, is that it may lead to feelings of isolation. Consequently, one must choose between their self-preservation or the preservation of their relationships with others. Though some may react passively to the revelation of deception, others may take offense and be displeased with the entire charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly contentious, as it raises several interconnected issues. At its core is the question: Why does the individual feel compelled to abandon their true identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, her motivation is clear: self-protection. Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, she resolves to pose as a man for her safety. Her strategy succeeds, but it also isolates her from the female companionship she once had, leaving her unsupported. Moreover, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love with her. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,\" Olivia exclaims (5.1.138). Additionally, she experiences suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nWhile this may reflect a more open-minded attitude, to a contemporary audience, \"Twelfth Night\" can be seen as an example of how deception can uncover hidden emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because he appears male, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It is unlikely that this is the case, as Shakespeare's Olivia seems to parody those of her time who judge others solely on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in Olivia's swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: \"A sister, you are she,\" she declares (5.1.315).",
            "The harsh legacy of German colonial governance, particularly in German South West Africa, has been spotlighted by numerous observers due to the infamous Ovaherero and Nama atrocities. However, it would be reductive to attribute the vast German colonial empire's dynamics solely to this singular narrative. The empire's policies and governing styles were as varied as its geographical expanse. Educational initiatives, similarly, varied among colonies. While the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919 revealed a populace with considerable educational attainment, German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies also garnered favorable remarks from contemporaries. Conversely, the education landscape in South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where state schools played a significant role, native education in South West Africa was predominantly managed by missionary societies, with minimal government involvement. The colonial government, though, lavished resources on European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary institutions. These policies had enduring influences on South West Africa long after German rule. Contrarily, while other German colonies boasted substantial literate and educated populations, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. A multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to delve into these factors, with a particular focus on recent research into the views of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. Extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire exists, much of which is in German and hails from the early 20th century, during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works centered on describing educational systems, while later English-language works broadened the discussion with comparative studies and in-depth analyses. These studies revealed significant variations among educational systems in different colonies. Cohen's research on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a seminal work, comparing these colonies' educational systems and explaining the factors behind their differences. Cohen attributes many of South West Africa's distinguishing educational features to its large settler population. Compared to other German colonies, South West Africa possessed a moderately temperate climate, with many areas being arid desert. This climate brought a relatively hospitable environment for European settlers. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved over the past century to encompass a multitude of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Intricately, many genres, including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given rise to numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Notably, the Heavy Metal rock genre has emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive in the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from the wide array of emotions it conveys, often leaning towards the darker spectrum. This genre's diversity lies in its early recognition of adaptability, leading to the creation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nToday's Heavy Metal landscape is so fragmented that pinpointing a definitive definition of the genre is difficult. It has assimilated themes from various other genres but, like any movement, it has its roots. To comprehend the Metal music prevalent today, understanding the Metal movement and its distinction from a mere genre is crucial.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be deemed a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Less primitive, more proficient; musicians in Metal bands possess exceptional instrumental skills, evident in their music. Additionally, Metal is a movement that has been heavily influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s led to the recording of more intense, otherworldly music, with drugs serving as a catalyst for creativity. It embodies dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively new to the music scene, as many popular genres emphasized lighter emotions. Furthermore, later generations of Metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prevalent in the Romantic Era.\n\nLyrics such as the following exemplify the darkness inherent to this movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles illustrate the darker side of the band's music, mirroring the ups and downs of drug influence. This song is considered by some to be an early Heavy Metal track. It was a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones song, with The Beatles aiming to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity. The song was included on The White Album.",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists, a decade or so before their inception, Henri Rousseau was assiduously cultivating his own dreamscapes, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" is not merely a portrayal of a woman marveling at a dreamland's wonders, but also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and inner conflicts. For years, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and esteem from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but found himself grappling with a profound internal dilemma. Should he conform to or imitate established artistic styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own unique path, he pondered. \"The Dream\" encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle: the desire to be acknowledged versus the urge to remain creatively independent.\n\nTo fully appreciate \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, France, in 1844, he hailed from a humble background. His father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed modest success. Growing up, Rousseau lacked formal art education; instead, he worked as a gabelou for France until the age of forty. Known as the \"douanier,\" he was a customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with a daughter named Julia and profound sorrow, driving him to painting as a source of solace and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau did not sentimentally romanticize the peasant in his art; he was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of his class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for art world acceptance is reasonable when considered in context. He lacks formal training and began his artistic journey later in life, working alongside more renowned artists. He didn't receive due recognition until around the same time Matisse was making a name for himself. Author Jan Gordon notes that while both were rivals in the art world, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations: \"Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau aimed to create a conventional painting to secure admittance to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "In the realm of intellectual discourse, numerous minds have posited a deep affinity between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I hold the conviction that this affinity is grounded in an intrinsic essence. As the words of John Keats in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" aptly convey, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge is acquired through formal education or life's experiences, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seemingly transcends these conventional paths. Both ethics and aesthetics, it seems, seek to elucidate rather than dictate. Our explorations of morality and beauty are largely efforts to comprehend why a work of art or literature is deemed beautiful, or why an action is deemed moral, rather than rigid rules for assessment or creation. In essence, the criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate the essence of what is deemed good or beautiful. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance. A discourse on its value might delve into elements such as foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these elements do not encapsulate why it is considered a masterpiece. Often, when asked about a favored piece of art or literature, one hears phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more intricate or analytical explanation. I contend that both art and morality possess an ineffable quality, a je ne sais quoi, that cannot be fully captured in a description of their attributes. Ethics, much like art, possess a transcendental nature. As Wittgenstein puts it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable essence, this indescribable something, is what imbues art and morality with their power, and it is this transcendental connection between them that I believe unites ethics and aesthetics. The shared experience of morality and art is particularly potent at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term, impacting us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. The connection is especially profound in literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about it, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" Living necessitates the engagement with values, and literature holds importance precisely because of the values we find within it.",
            "Germany, a nation of today, is a robust, unified territory that boasts a distinctive cultural tapestry, woven together from the alpine landscapes of Munich to the Baltic Sea shores of Kiel. This unique heritage can be felt in cities like Cologne along the Rhine, traversing the heart of Germany, and the Saxon city of Dresden situated by the Elbe River. The diversity of Germany's culture is not surprising as it arises from a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral home of the Germans is Germania. The origins of the name are a subject of debate among scholars, with some attributing it to the Germanic tribe known historically as the Tungrians. Tacitus proposed that the Germans were so named due to their residence beyond the Rhine, engaging in frequent skirmishes with Gaulish forces. Alternatively, Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls under his control and those who remained unconquered. He derived this from the Gauls themselves, who employed it to differentiate their foes. Others suggest the name might come from the Old English word \"ger\" for their spear or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating their formidable nature.\n\nTacitus, in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" from AD 98, recorded that the Germans were considered autochthonous, having migrated by sea rather than land. He pondered why anyone would choose to live in the wild, harsh climate of Germania over more hospitable lands like Italy or Rome. Similarly, the Romans, while they occasionally ventured into Germania for resources and conquests, primarily returned to their empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to thrive on the borders.",
            "Gazing down at the tableau before me, my mind was as vacant as a blank canvas. Indifferently, without a hint of emotion, I scrutinized the scene, my analytical faculties at work, yet they remained detached from any cognitive comprehension. Ideas flitted in and out of my consciousness with such swiftness that it seemed I was merely experiencing an endless stream of external stimuli. The calm efficiency of my perception made me question if I even possessed thoughts of my own. Once, a colleague suggested that I acquire \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to enhance my artistic abilities. Ever since I was a child, I had been captivated by the idea of drawing, and this book offered insights into the brain's interpretation of lines and shapes. It introduced a technique of framing any subject of study within a square, transforming complex scenes into simpler, more manageable images. Standing there, overwhelmed by the intricate arrangement of a bowl of fruit on a table, I was unable to mentally impose such a frame. The awestruck wonder that filled me was akin to the initial stirrings of the artist's journey, the genesis of my own artistic odyssey, \"Brown's Genesis.\" My fingers touched the chosen tool of my art, and my muscles tensed and released in rhythm with my hand's motion through space, each stroke a testament to my will. Water swirled serenely, crystal clear and unblemished. Matter detached itself, floating away like embers from a dying flame. My hand, anxious and hurried in its second attempt, struck the toilet handle, but the offending package remained stubbornly in place, a slug-like obstruction. Mop in hand, feet firmly planted, a green tie uncomfortably encircling my neck, I scrutinized the offensive deposit. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping itself in layers until it resembled a thick, misshapen mop. Straightening up, bending at the waist, my hand lowered into the bowl, mirroring the actions of a cook preparing a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage fatalities on the road is a complex tapestry of contributing factors. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain's immaturity is a significant factor in this predicament. Inexperience, the cornerstone of teenage driving, exacerbates the issue, leading to a surge in fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, excessive speeding, and road deviations. Peer influence further amplifies the danger, as teenagers frequently drive with their peers, as any sensible individual would know. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center's study corroborates this, revealing a direct correlation between the passengers' age and the frequency of traffic incidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states have implemented provisional licenses to mitigate these risks, restricting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely patchwork solutions. The core problem lies in the fact that, collectively, teenagers are statistically unprepared to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman advocates for delaying driving age beyond 18 to allow the propensity for thrill-seeking to subside. By 2010, a new wave of teenage drivers, the 'Boomers' offspring, will hit the road, potentially escalating the fatality toll.\n\nA feasible legislative approach could see schools continue teaching driver's education to lay the foundation for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. Provisional permits would still be issued upon certain conditions, including practical training hours. The specific number could mirror current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult-supervised practice. A national uniform policy could effectively protect teenagers nationwide, as these fatalities transcend state boundaries.\n\nThe proposed legislation is far from innovative.",
            "While navigating the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a trove of fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films largely exploit creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily revolved around outlining the poetic elements present in the majority of these trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few later ones. The trick films of the late 19th century are predominantly set-bound, constrained within a static frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, and employing long and medium shots, adhering to the rigid rule of one shot equaling one film. However, a select few films from the early 20th century dare to diverge from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains steadfast in its position, adhering to a static viewpoint. This style draws upon theatrical and vaudeville traditions. One notable example is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame, never approaching or receding from the camera.\n\nThis static composition often results in long and, less frequently, medium shots, with close-ups being entirely absent. This echoes the theatrical and vaudeville convention, where the audience witnessed the entire performance simultaneously within the stage's borders. Actors typically remain in the middle ground, eschewing close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to a single film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricts their dramatic potential, favoring brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic and switching acts over complex narratives. However, a closer examination reveals that a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes may actually comprise multiple physical shots, joined to create illusions. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. A careful viewing reveals that the 'head' shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins midway through, though the film is perceived as one continuous shot.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republican principles in his era. While primarily an agriculturalist, his agricultural pursuits, combined with his brief political career, marked him as a man steadfast in his views on individual liberties and governance. His agrarian background deeply influenced his stances on sovereignty, the constitution, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed America's fledgling nationhood presented a unique chance to craft an ideal governance model, unhindered by native traditions. He strongly upheld the natural rights of individuals, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one compromises the value of all. These rights, he argued, should transcend the grasp of the government. He posited that in a state of nature, the physically strong and cunning benefited, but in civilization, this should not be the norm.\n\nTo achieve this utopian society, Taylor envisioned a government acknowledging the inherent good and evil in humanity. He advocated for a dualistic morality, asserting, \"As government is administered by man, its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He deemed good principles those that safeguard private property, advance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on such principles would operate justly despite its leaders' leadership, who, he believed, would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many Republicans of his time, championed strict constitutional interpretation. He advocated for a minimal Federal government, limited to the rights explicitly stated in the Constitution, citing the high cost and potential despotism of an extensive one. However, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation that could become corrupt without reference to the founders' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, a significant downturn in commuter log submissions occurred during the third month of the project, which was somewhat disconcerting. The onset of winter in New England likely contributed, as fewer people commuted by bicycle or foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity, and the holiday season, which could have led students and faculty to overlook the commuter log. The project faced the hurdle of sustaining momentum amidst seasonal breaks and the intrinsic appeal of driving. To address this, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March to rekindle enthusiasm, which indeed spurred an increase in log submissions. Another obstacle was the ingrained preference for driving, necessitating robust incentives. We offered gift certificates to local businesses and even considered more substantial prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, potentially boosting engagement. Altering prize value over time might have further bolstered participation. Initially, gift cards sufficed, but escalating the prize offerings could have mitigated the project's engagement decline.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument that mirrors the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on an exchange like stocks. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. However, ETFs are typically associated with lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. Nevertheless, they come with trade-offs, including commission fees for every transaction, akin to stock purchases. One of the standout features of ETFs is the wide range of available options.\n\nDespite the explicit benefits, it's prudent for a seasoned investor to scrutinize these advantages, particularly diversification, to ascertain their validity and degree. Here, we will assess the ETF IHF by comparing it to its top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how these top ten stocks reflect the entire ETF IHF, we will normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these ten stocks in the proportions dictated by the ETF's holdings. The results are as follows:\n\nIt's clear from the chart that a portfolio composed of just the top ten holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF as a whole, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer higher returns with a lower risk. However, it is essential to conduct further analysis to determine if these two portfolios exhibit statistically significant differences.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical differences, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize these values to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-claimed superior poems. Here, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used this term in reference to an island north of Britain, a vestige of the ancient world's edge. While Virgil indeed used this term, there's a more contemporary influence to consider. Poe, with his keen interest in German literature, likely drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nThis connection is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe may have been drawing upon Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the second part lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poem about a king who, after his wife's death, drinks heavily and eventually takes his own life. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both works depicting a king haunted by loss and grief.\n\nPoe references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses \"Thulé\" as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two poems can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely landscape, haunted by the specters of deceased friends, and devoid of color. This description resonates with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king, bereft of his wife, is consumed by loneliness and despair. It's as if the speaker of \"Dream-Land\" has stepped into Goethe's poem. Poe would have known of Goethe's work through Tennyson, whom he admired, or through the numerous reproductions that circulated after the original publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a patron injured by falling in a grocery store due to an applesauce spill be awarded punitive damages if the store manager, informed twice of the hazard, did not clean it within a half-hour because he was dining?\n\nGiven the circumstances, a judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's case for punitive damages. For such damages to be justified, evidence must be presented that the defendant's actions were deliberate and exhibited a disregard for potential harm, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the risk involved in not cleaning the spill, as multiple incidents of injury had occurred previously. However, while her argument that Martin's actions were outrageous may not be entirely compelling, it is still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and his failure to address them.\n\nOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 PM, an employee at D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, notified his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and couldn't handle the issue. At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the spill, with Martin responding similarly. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a severe back injury. Before this incident, five slip-and-fall reports had been filed at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a partial summary against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual wrongs if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for others' safety. Id. at § 3294(c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when it involves a conscious disregard of the probable consequences, demonstrating that the defendant \"willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. The class centered on a contentious debate: the question of whether Islam is inherently hostile. This query seems as pertinent today as ever. Post-9/11, the U.S. media's stance on Islam and extremism has evolved dramatically, shifting from hostility to an unprecedented level of tolerance. In 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim lineage, was unthinkable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography captivates me, yet it presents a discrepancy with his character. The historical Muhammad appeared coercive, forcefully converting tribes and imposing Islam. In contrast, his biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly attracting converts one by one. I find parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles,' such as multiplying mutton and milk for forty men. This narrative style diminishes Jesus' miracle and life, attributing his qualities to Muhammad. Moreover, many stories in the biography appear to serve as testimonials of voluntary conversions, but often relayed through third-hand accounts, which weakens their credibility. Most disturbingly, the work elevates Muhammad as a paragon of godliness, humility, wisdom, and gentleness, yet historical records contradict this portrayal, raising questions about the true nature of his rise to power.",
            "The tenets espoused by Jesus during his life were quickly eclipsed in the course of Christian thought's evolution post-mortem. Examining this trajectory on a grand scale, there's a discernible drift away from the religion's origins. The modern world, however, exhibits a burgeoning consciousness and an unparalleled progressive spirit. Meanwhile, traditionalists, steadfast in their beliefs, may not be numerous enough to sway the collective tide. Among Christians, historical comprehension is poised to expand significantly in the coming years. This understanding will fuel a yearning to disentangle the doctrines that have been interwoven into Christianity over time from the true spirit of its founder. This process, though gradual, is inevitable: a return to Christianity's original form. A movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding time, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to humanity remains. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing multitudes to worship as if living in Jesus' time, the church will remain steadfast as a guiding force. However, the theological pendulum will have swung back, resulting in a reduction of diversity and an increase in uniformity of belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and factional differences will give way to similarities. History is replete with such reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, only to see that empire later become Christian. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The imminent reversion in Christianity will similarly revert history, seeking the source and undoing diversity in the process. This transformation will be hastened by an interpretative shift, viewing Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. Thus, what has transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nTraversing history, we find only Judaism, the foundational theology for Christianity. At Jerusalem's Roman takeover in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divine revelation, and Hebrew scripture authority were at the core. Jewish society was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority common folk.",
            "I contend that The Jungle posits an inherent selfishness within humanity, where individuals prioritize their own advancement over the welfare of others. This is vividly illustrated by the factory owners and managers who strive to expand their enterprises with no regard for those who suffer in their wake. Their insatiable ambition is portrayed by Upton Sinclair, who depicts the factories as \"great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". The owners' apathy towards pollution and the well-being of the community is evident in their disregard for the pollution and waste generated by their operations. Furthermore, they prioritize profits over worker welfare, exploiting their employees with grueling work schedules and sudden layoffs, often leaving them without compensation or assistance in finding alternative employment. During the time The Jungle was set, there was a dearth of laws protecting workers' safety or well-being, enabling managers and owners to subjugate their workforce to subpar conditions. The workers in Packingtown were effectively trapped in this system, with no recourse for improvement or escape. The book subtly suggests that these workers were akin to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\". Hence, the narrative underscores the exploitation and suffering of the working class at the hands of unscrupulous employers.",
            "In literary works, authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific sentiments or attitudes towards significant themes. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys various techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, Fitzgerald couples adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create a certain ambiance around a subject. Furthermore, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently utilizes them to achieve similar ends. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald invests colors with significance, notably white/gray and red/pink, and employs these meanings later to evoke specific feelings associated with important objects.\n\nWhite/gray, for instance, is associated with uniformity, where white signifies elegance and higher social standing, while gray denotes age and weariness. Fitzgerald establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted in white—even Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby’s party, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick describes Gatsby’s party, where the halls are adorned with vibrant primary colors, standing in stark contrast to the uniformity of white.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by applying white/gray to ordinary subjects. Nick's journey to work is described as descending through \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), while the names on his timetable become \"gray names\" (61). Additionally, he colors mundane people and places with these hues: Daisy and Jordan shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child on the railroad (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy, who, after a prolonged absence of significant color use, is suddenly described as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" This portrayal diminishes Daisy's character, depicting her as a mere uniform addition—an object of Gatsby's longing. Fitzgerald continues this technique, emphasizing Daisy’s uniformity with a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her wearing a white dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County, renowned for its yielding agricultural landscape, thrives under a serene, sun-filled climate. The terrain is fertile with a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The area harbors a robust demand for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups boasting extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk, too, are highly sought after. Numerous organic farms invite visitors to observe their operations, offering hiking trails and birdwatching opportunities.\n\nThis type of farm operation can be advantageous for the landowner, as they can benefit from government initiatives while enhancing habitat and facilitating recreational activities, such as farm tours and educational programs. Organic farming, while beneficial for biodiversity in plants and wildlife, presents greater expenses compared to conventional farming. It demands more intensive labor and management to handle pests and weeds without chemicals, and yields can be less consistent. Additionally, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nThe chosen land, adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, measures 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. Historically, this area has been inhabited by Native Americans before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production.",
            "The role of culture in any negotiation is multifaceted and profound. Culture, often defined as much by what it isn't as what it is, is a complex and varied entity that isn't uniform or singular. It is not accurate to generalize about entire nations or groups, such as suggesting \"all Russians are tough\" or \"all Japanese are cooperative.\" While understanding broad cultural traits is beneficial, a negotiator should focus on the specific cultural elements relevant to the negotiation at hand, and how these elements may influence the dialogue and interactions. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, and comparisons are inevitable.\n\nDelving into a foreign culture or mindset can involve a range of activities from studying its background to recognizing its biases. Rather than evaluating or attempting to alter a culture, one must acknowledge it and operate within its confines, especially when at a negotiation table with a weaker bargaining stance. Respect for local traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural hurdles and propel the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that culture isn't confined to national or international boundaries. Many enterprises within a single country develop their unique corporate cultures, which can vary drastically. For example, some companies prioritize long office hours, while others promote a more laid-back schedule. Indicators of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication styles (ranging from direct to indirect), and hiring practices. Some businesses encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it to approved initiatives. Even within the United States, corporate cultures can differ significantly, with variations existing not only between companies but also within a single organization, depending on location, whether urban or suburban. Some cultures appear less stratified, but this uniformity can be deceiving; it may be an indication to explore further.\n\nValues are particularly significant to understand, as they provide the rationale behind a culture. If a culture values maintaining harmony or saving face, a negotiator will not publicly embarrass their company or superior to secure a deal. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes intense bargaining may not settle quickly. Being aware of these cultural tendencies before negotiation is crucial, but it's also beneficial to learn about the individual opponent to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The quotation, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" can be found at the beginning of Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and was also utilized by St. Anselm in his discourse on the existence of God. This belief appears to be shared by another influential thinker, Thomas Aquinas. To fairly assess which of these arguments is more persuasive, let us initially presume that both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God of the Bible. Adopting a different concept of a divine entity would complicate the comparison, as both arguments are centered around a specific divine being. However, neither argument offers a comprehensive foundation for believing in this particular deity.\n\nFirst, let us delve into the core argument of St. Anselm. His approach emphasizes introspection, suggesting that understanding God is found within one's own thoughts and understanding. He posits that God's existence is so inherently clear that it cannot be denied, as it is ingrained in our minds. This notion, while somewhat oblique, essentially argues that the proof for God lies within us, and no external evidence is required. This perspective is often referred to as faith within Christian tradition.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, advocates for a more rational approach. He contends that God's existence can be logically proven through empirical and rational means, without the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous in Christianity's mission of converting new adherents, as it relies solely on logical reasoning rather than the acceptance of unprovable ideas. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments to support his case, each demonstrating that the need for God is logically necessary. If one piece of a puzzle is missing, and the rest fit perfectly, logic dictates the existence of the missing piece, even without seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, during the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future sage, later known as the Buddha, emerged. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, resulting in the inception of Buddhism. This faith, with its most traditional branch known as Theravada, is approximately 2500 years old and has transformed significantly over time. For example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the ritual of the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, involving both monks and laypeople, despite the Buddha's teachings lacking any mention of such a celebration. These changes permeate the religion, from surface-level customs to its core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from the monastery or the laity, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both internal and external, friendly and unfriendly factors.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discourse. Internal forces refer to influences from fellow Buddhists, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to negative perceptions. Benign forces are those that do not wish to harm or aid the community, but may incidentally do so. These terms will recur throughout this discussion.\n\nTo begin, the fundamental elements of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism—should be examined. Buddhists find solace in the Triple Gem consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, or three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects. Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognition of these principles is necessary to liberate oneself from Sansara, the cycle of rebirth, and to eliminate lobha (desire), dosa (hate), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for life, with five precepts for laypeople (I will not kill, I will not lie, I will not steal, I will not engage in inappropriate sexual conduct, and I will not use intoxicants) and numerous rules for monks. The four noble truths form the most fundamental doctrinal concept. The first truth is that life is filled with suffering. The second is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico's relationship has been marked by a protracted rivalry extending over five and a half decades, from 1836 until 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the United States vanquished Mexico and acquired Texas and the southwestern territories. Throughout this period, numerous skirmishes occurred between the two nations, with tensions easing only in the aftermath of World War I. The roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental differences such as religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dynamic is not unique to the United States and Mexico; neighboring nations often experience similar rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find enduring, overarching American diplomatic challenges\" (p. 41). These nations, geographically proximate to the United States, have historically been rivals, whereas other Latin American countries have enjoyed more harmonious relations. Religious tensions, a recurrent theme in international relations, played a significant role in this rivalry. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86), much like the ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, where the conflict was part political and part a battle over key interests. These tensions were exacerbated by the enduring mistrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial past. This mutual mistrust was a formidable obstacle to the development of cordial diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period, the majority of which were territorial in nature. Issues such as border raids by outlaws and bandits from American towns into Mexican territory remained a persistent problem until both nations imposed military control over their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). The rivalry began to abate as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States economically (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109). This dependence, coupled with a shift in American ambition from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt, 1974, p. 110), marked the end of the rivalry in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen and crippling ailment struck me down abruptly, a condition I had been wholly unaware of. At that time, I was employed as a nurse, a profession I had chosen to ensure the security and stability I had known as a child. \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill,\" I heard repeatedly as I grew older. Thus, I opted for nursing over my dreams of becoming a scientist or a journalist, a blend of both. Yet, here I was at 46, unmarried, penniless, and unable to work. My disability persists to this day, and after 15 years of Social Security Disability payments, I possess nothing that is truly mine. The daily struggle has eroded my sense of security, safety, and self-worth, leaving me with no certainties in life. Still, I am convinced that I would not have endured these years without my family's and a few friends' support, as strong as I was. In truth, when calamity strikes, strength fades quickly.\n\nI believe that emergencies, big or small, are a constant in life. Despite thorough planning, some crises are insurmountable alone. I concur that we should not place all our faith in the crumbling government structure. However, I advocate that Americans learn to trust and support one another again, rather than each individual hoarding resources like a lone survivor.\n\nThe notion of rugged individualism, often championed by the American right, is a myth. Our forefathers' resilience in hard times stemmed from empathy, mutual respect, and resource sharing, not isolation. The pioneers who journeyed across the Rockies did not reach the coast alone. They relied on community and cooperation.\n\nWhile I advocate preparedness—disaster kits, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and so on—I also urge you to foster relationships with your neighbors. Let us rebuild our communities and aid one another, for that is how we shall weather storms.",
            "The query of why organisms evolve in specific ways and the constraints that guide this evolution has been a perplexing one since D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 assertion that even the simplest organic forms remain undefined in mathematical terms. However, recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to various biological phenomena, including the development of mollusk shells through both their growth and evolutionary history. Our investigation aims to merge mathematical models of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum species with experimental data to uncover the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary changes. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model potential and actual shell morphologies in software like CerioShell. These results are then harmonized with experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell is essentially a three-dimensional structure that evolves along a 360-degree path in space over time. These loops or turns in the shell are called whorls, which spiral around a central imaginary axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the final one, called the body whorl. The spire comprises all whorls except the last, with the apex being the spire's tip and the opposite end called the base. The aperture is the opening through which the animal emerges from the shell.\n\nShells can be examined from various angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The typical view is an apertural one, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the start of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, approximating to a quarter whorl where necessary.\n\nShells can also be perceived as a sequence of apertures that traverse through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The trajectory of the aperture can be visually and mathematically tracked using coordinates of the aperture centers and the horizontal and vertical radii. Once mathematically formulated, these parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have remained largely unchanged. Although the country is making strides towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, it's falling significantly short in improving child and maternal health indicators to meet 2015 goals. Multiple factors underlie these shortcomings, suggesting a need to bolster Indonesia's overall healthcare system rather than solely relying on specific program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has shown progress in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot handle medical interventions in complicated pregnancies. Thus, maternal deaths from hemorrhage remain high, indicating there's still much ground to cover. Additionally, there's been a decrease in the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Postnatal care data is incomplete but reveals low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than anticipated, at approximately 4%. This disparity is more pronounced in rural areas, where rates drop to 2%. This disparity highlights inequities in healthcare access, with urban areas receiving more attention. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting the poor face significant challenges affording healthcare.\n\nWhen considering improvements to neonatal and maternal care, the primary question is how to best address the lack of adequate services. Should Indonesia focus on targeted program-specific approaches or build up its overall healthcare system? Vertical, targeted approaches offer defined, manageable goals and faster results. However, they can lead to uneven funding distribution and human resource allocation, as seen in HIV/AIDS and family planning sectors. Moreover, they can result in duplicated, uncoordinated services, increasing paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the elite society of the era. Two works that diverge from this standard are 'Oliver Twist' and 'Wuthering Heights'. Both employ an element of intrigue and eccentricity, uncommon in their contemporaries, which deepens the characters' profiles and provides insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist is engulfed by the cacophony of sounds and lights, he is suddenly overwhelmed by a vivid recollection of his past experiences, seemingly trapped in a constant state of confusion and disorientation. The passage delves into his inner turmoil, depicting a sense of helplessness and desperation as he is unable to exert control over his circumstances. The shooting sequence, revisited in chapter 28, is a stark reminder of his vulnerability and the lack of agency he possesses over his life. As he relives the traumatic event, he is once again engulfed by despair, reflecting the growing influence of Fagin over him. This sequence underscores the notion that Oliver is powerless to alter his fate, reinforcing his sense of defeat as he is forced to accept his circumstances.\n\nThe temporal distortion in the passage is evocative, depicting a cycle of day and night that seems to blur together, suggesting an unending loop of suffering. The relentless repetition of the day and night sequence mirrors the repetitive nature of Oliver's existence, highlighting his trapped and desolate state.",
            "Several years back, I was involved in an after-school program aimed at tutoring elementary-aged students. My forte was English and reading, but I did my best to assist them in any subject they struggled with. A colleague approached me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. Initially, his issues seemed unusual as he could pronounce some letters correctly while others were entirely off the mark. He was of Latino descent and spoke fluent English, yet his reading comprehension was problematic. A significant breakthrough occurred when I met his mother. She entered the building while I was temporarily supervising a few children remaining after a field trip. Despite speaking only Spanish, we managed to communicate thanks to my limited Spanish skills. It then became clear that Adrian was not having trouble reading but rather with recognizing the English alphabet.\n\nI share this anecdote to emphasize the challenges posed by language barriers in educational settings, particularly in California. Even though Adrian spoke perfect English, he faced significant hurdles in reading due to his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This highlights that reading difficulties can be more complex than they initially appear.\n\nTo address this issue, a multi-faceted approach is crucial. For instance, the dual language system offers numerous benefits, not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research has shown that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. Yet, fears persist that such programs waste resources and do not benefit the majority of students. However, implementing these programs as the standard could provide advantages to all. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual. Instead, we can employ bilingual aids or tutors to support the students.",
            "Since our earliest memories, many of us are imbued with the notion of something greater than our individual selves, something that transcends our ability to grasp fully. Some are catechized in Sunday school, while others engage in religious rituals or introspection. Inheriting beliefs from our predecessors is common, yet some cast off these traditions, asserting their singular worldview. Our journeys to construct our spiritual identities are as varied as the paths we tread. We seek guidance to navigate the darkness and emerge into the light.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father replied to my query about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, the rain's rhythmic patter on the tin roof echoing our quiet conversation as we shared cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain, quenching the thirsty plants along the porch edge. His gaze, a mix of curiosity and reminiscence, shifted between the downpour and the distant horizon. His once robust figure had grown gaunt; his once thick hair had thinned. His avoidance of my gaze was palpable, a chasm between us. I felt isolated, anxious, and unable to express my fears to him. Instead, I moved closer, wrapping him in a silent embrace, our shared silence punctuated only by the symphony of the rain.\n\nFather passed in December, days after my twenty-second birthday. The extended survival, facilitated by chemotherapy and radiation, bought time, yet it only prolonged his suffering. The worth of this time was elusive to me. If a divine entity existed, I thought, it had abandoned me. In the stillness of the night, I refrained from prayer. If God listened, it was not to me.\n\nI chose not to witness his transition. The thought of observing the creator of my life was too much to bear. I yearned to recall him through the prism of his life, not his passing. I retreated into a cocoon of solitude, curling up in my bed for three days, awaiting news that never came. The silence was deafening, echoing the emptiness I felt.",
            "The quintessential \"Gothic Novel,\" as \"Old-New\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has been alternately dismissed and celebrated, labeled as lacking depth while simultaneously praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). At its inception, the \"Gothic Novel\" drew from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to birth a new literary form, as exemplified by Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole merged \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' naturalistic mimicry in his portrayal of \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, rooted in medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, paradoxically became associated with outdated or primitive sensibilities despite the 'modern' advancements it represented. This fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's personal character psychology ensured its enduring appeal, rendering it both obsolete and fresh to readers separated by time from its original inception.\n\nOne persistent theme in Gothic literature is the idealization of chivalry, a concept rooted in medieval knight training. The Gothic novel, particularly The Castle of Otranto, retained and transformed this medieval notion. Chivalry's appeal to Gothic writers lay in its embodiment of the brave, honorable, and competent knight, a stark contrast to their perception of contemporary society's lack of these qualities. By incorporating chivalric elements, the \"gothic past\" was romanticized and used as a critique and aspiration for the present. Walpole, writing in a politically fraught era, may have felt that the supposed moral goodness of the Gothic age had been lost in his contemporaries. This is evident in his character, Frederic, who exemplifies chivalric traits before ever meeting him. Described as a prince, one who has endured tragedy, and a presumed victim of infidels, Frederic embodies the soon-to-be iconic trope of Gothic excess.",
            "The flow of logistics, from initial procurement of raw materials through to delivery to the end-user, constitutes a supply chain's operations. This concept, coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, involves the strategic oversight and management of this sequence to fulfill customer needs rapidly and effectively. The supply chain comprises six critical facets: production, procurement, inventory, location, transport, and data exchange. Business leaders harness these components to deliver superior customer service.\n\nProduction is the cornerstone of the supply chain process. It sets the foundation for all subsequent stages. Production planning involves determining when, why, where, and how products will be made. Understanding customer preferences is paramount for effective production. Market analysis provides valuable insights into consumer demand. Once demand is understood, decisions on product types and quantities to produce can be made. Location selection for production is crucial, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Production scheduling and equipment maintenance follow, ensuring efficiency and minimizing long-term costs. Consistent procedural guidelines, like those employed by Wal-Mart and Target, promote smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second essential aspect of supply chain management is procurement. Procurement strategies aim to establish a facility's core capabilities and foster strategic partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division suits various manufacturing processes best. Outsourcing to external partners can enhance flexibility and reduce costs without compromising quality, thereby accelerating the supply chain.",
            "A mysterious sign reads, \"Hitler Survives in Burmese Territory.\" Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a bustling city street, a hastily made cardboard sign held aloft. The sign bears a chilling message, written in bold, black lettering. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military regime, which seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, public protests, led by Buddhist monks, erupted, marking the first demonstrations after a decade of silence. These peaceful gatherings, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" for the monks' robes, attracted widespread attention. Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather, but violence escalated, with monasteries raided, foreign journalists imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, killed.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have suppressed dissent and asserted complete control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current leader, George W. Bush, has reportedly conferred with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a division of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, activists, and students were met with a violent crackdown by the Chinese government. The death toll varies greatly, from 200 to 3,000. Another tragic example is the 1994 Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia, aided by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates. And who could forget the horrors of Hitler's Third Reich, a period of mass killings targeting Jewish individuals across Europe.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his sustained career and his ability to mold his orchestra. His piano presence, though often subtle, is eclipsed by his prowess as a composer. Ellington excelled in crafting intricate pieces that spotlighted individual musicians' talents, providing structured frameworks for solos and integrating unique musical ideas. He prioritized ensemble cohesion and the distinctive tones of each member, resulting in groundbreaking and brilliant compositions. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as an instrument, demonstrated in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he employed vocal textures and colors without lyrics. This piece showcases his knack for complementing soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. \"Creole Love Call\" features six choruses, each characterized by distinct call-and-response dynamics and solo instruments. Ellington's use of voice as a solo instrument, as seen in the growl technique, adds depth to his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington showcases his orchestration skills and keen ear for tone color. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing harmonizes vocal elements of Miley's playing with instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. Similarly, in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington masterfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she harbored an insatiable longing, a void that refused to be satiated. At fourteen, it began, and though three years had passed, it remained, now a yearning for connection rather than a thing. Boys her peers found intriguing, but none piqued her interest. She pondered this perplexing conundrum often, her curiosity unabated. Her life was typically uneventful, her parents a pair of serene individuals, their disagreements rare and confined to her assertions of independence. Yet, today was different.\n\nAs she traversed the house, searching for inspiration, a piercing scream echoed from the kitchen. Her heart pounded as she rushed in, desperation etched on her face. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, moaning softly. She knelt beside her, concern etched on her face. \"Mom, can you tell me where to take you?\" Her mother, her voice strained, directed her to the car. With her mother's instructions, she hoisted her into the back seat, climbing behind the wheel. The hospital, a sterile and foreboding place, was her destination.\n\nThe doctor's verdict revealed her mother had fallen from a stool while attempting to reach a high shelf.",
            "This investigation aimed to demonstrate the link between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), represented by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is essentially a tweaked version of the Med diet, emphasizing higher intake of plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, swapping monounsaturated fats for saturated fats and including fish, while lowering consumption of animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol intake permitted. Prior research has shown an inverse correlation between following a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and a clinical trial revealed the Med diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, previous studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis longitudinal study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, free of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times over 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess yearly nutrient intake. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation over the 20-year period, with FFQs validated through studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Cases lacking records were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Variables like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone therapy use were assessed for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity added beginning in 1986.\n\nTo mitigate random variation for individuals and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed, averaging scores from two prior years. Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 strokes, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, a severe financial catastrophe struck the United States. Joblessness surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous major American corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent a recurrence? Essentially, the financial crisis was the result of shortsighted and self-serving political choices that coerced banks and firms into providing subprime loans within an inadequate and unready financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks were lacking sufficient capital reserves and transferred the ensuing tumult to the repacked mortgages they had sold, further contaminating the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration's 1999 policies. Seeking a second term, the president relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move set the stage for the subprime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, felt increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals, while also facing stockholder demands to maintain its remarkable profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the repercussions of these actions: “Yet, the government-subsidized corporation may encounter difficulties in an economic downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to the one provided to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As anticipated in the introduction, ill-considered lending practices ultimately precipitated the economic collapse.\n\nA multitude of factors conspired to plunge the economy into turmoil, one of them being the new and convoluted mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years preceding the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This overleveraging left U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities in a precarious position. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing about 30% of the U.S. GDP. Consequently, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a loss, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the introduction phase.  That section in your narrative where you spread your creative wings and captivate your audience with your enchanting, almost spellbinding composition.  Or perhaps it's the part where your readers nod off or hit the \"back\" button, swearing under their breath at the sheer dreariness of it all.  Dr. M. has been known to mutter unpleasantries at her screen when she encounters an excess of background details, and not the enjoyable kind.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already aware of the fundamental writing guideline, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. M. still finds herself ensnared in lengthy stretches of prose where nothing occurs, or worse, an overload of information.  Exposition is that pesky whisper in your ear that persuades you to squeeze in the backstory to get to the juicier bits (not to be mistaken for the voice suggesting you reveal every intimate detail of your characters' pasts).\n\nExposition signifies relaying information to the audience, usually in straightforward language.  In film, it's when one character shares extensive knowledge with another, similar to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, you're the one doing the sharing.\n\nConsider this instance.  As you read a tale, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific location and time, wedded him in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed in her presence.  You wouldn't anticipate this entire sequence to occupy two pages, during which they barely utter a word each.  You'd anticipate the author to dedicate time to fleshing out the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior the depth of his affection for his wife, and to equally illustrate the heroine's transformation and enhancement due to his presence (especially if the story later states it outright).  A proper introduction of the husband's character would foster empathy for his demise and give insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the strength of their bond, reflections of her thoughts and beliefs and dreams through his lens, and so forth.  You'd mourn his loss with her, and thereby become more connected to her.\n\nIn essence, you should offer substance to the simple skeleton of the plot: \"They met, they wed, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance.  (*glances at metaphor, sighs, presses forward*)  Sometimes, the temptation is strong to hurry past certain elements.  Maybe you're introducing a new character and know he served in the military, now runs a gas station at night, was married twice, no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly yearns to own the station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The initial one, aired live on August 13, 2011, was from NBC 4. The primary story was about an incident in Ashley, Ohio, involving a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife. The report was brief, lasting approximately two minutes, and provided minimal details. The second story was about an early morning shooting of a 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The story was brief, and I suspect this could be attributed to the involvement of a minority. I've observed a pattern where stories involving minorities are often given less attention. For instance, if a white child or adult is involved in a crime, the media coverage is extensive, but when it's a minority, it's fortunate if it gets any mention at all. Another story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, believed to be caused by a .22 caliber rifle. A reward of five thousand dollars was offered for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The weather forecast mentioned rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This story was short but served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. A story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF store featured a dark-skinned black man as the suspect. The report emphasized his race and physical description, which seemed excessive. Another story mentioned a convicted Texas drug lord, Rene Rodriguez, known for distributing large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they stated \"300\" months, which I found peculiar. They also highlighted his Hispanic background, which seemed unrelated to the story.",
            "A kinship between siblings, unyielding and constant, holds a myriad of feelings: affection, arrogance, envy, and harshness, among others. They comprehend one another deeply, more so than anyone else bound by such a tie, and when they gaze upon their brother, they glimpse their own soul. It's in the gravest of moments that this bond reveals its true essence, whether it be benign or malevolent. These sentiments, when exposed, exact a severe toll. Part of grappling with the feelings born of this fraternal connection is confronting their aftermath. When one peers into the eyes of a brother, they behold not their reflection as others may see it, but as they truly are. Their actions and the repercussions thereof unveil their genuine nature. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Traversing a vividly described terrain, these two boys embark on a doomed voyage. A clash of bitter disappointment and fierce pride unfolds in the culminating scene, and only one brother survives. This theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their exchanges, as well as the narrator's perspective, which elucidates the intricate emotions Doodle experiences and his view of the world around him, both of which significantly shape his behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to one overriding emotion: haughtiness. From their initial outings together to their final, calamitous trip, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could learn all of his expertise, such as holding his breath, running, jumping, or scaling the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He longed for a companion who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing and perch with him at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's frailty, a result of his weak heart, made these expectations unachievable. Doodle was not capable of participating in strenuous activities, much less surviving. The young protagonist's dreams were shattered, and he even contemplated killing Doodle by suffocating him with a pillow. But when the child smiled at him, his heart softened. This act of kindness, so simple yet powerful, offered the protagonist a glimmer of hope, suggesting that his initial intent may not have been deeply rooted. In the depths of his heart, he held an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain, an intricate and imaginative data manipulator, has witnessed shifts in its metaphors as technology evolved from rudimentary to contemporary forms. It was initially likened to a wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, followed by a book, and finally, a computer. As one delves into the intricacies of the mind, it's crucial to recognize the limitations and potential pitfalls of these analogies.\nInformation journey begins with sensory organs, which convert external stimuli into electrical signals. This data is continually transformed by the brain's algorithms through dual pathways: bottom-up and top-down. For instance, perceiving a black box on a white background involves piecing together simple data like color, direction, and edges to determine the object's shape. Top-down processing aids in faster recognition by utilizing prior decisions to identify the object. For example, it helps distinguish a black box from a box-shaped void in the background.\nAfter initial processing, an attention gate sorts the relevance and accessibility of signals. While the brain processes every blade of grass upon gazing at one's shoes, a healthy attention gate filters out individual blades. Conversely, even in a noisy environment, one can pick out their name. Multiple processing stages repeat this attention modulation.\nData retention is crucial for the brain's operation. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies by stimuli type, such as structural, phonemic, or semantic. Information is maintained through various means, with working memory potentially sustained by brief electrical loops among neurons, and long-term memory potentially retained in specific protein structures.\nDiverse models propose differing ways to structure knowledge in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysics. The semantic network model posits that concepts are node-like entities connected based on their relationships. For example, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can further connect to \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" presents a prospective threat posed by both technology and capitalism, engendering a dystopian society where communal interests supersede individuality. Citizens are indoctrinated from birth to prioritize immediate gratification, serving as pawns in a grand scheme controlled by the World Controller. This dystopia, scrutinized through a Marxist lens, reveals Huxley's concerns about the burgeoning economic systems of his era. Key Marxist concepts like homogeneity and reification underscore the critique of economic flaws in Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which denies the common populace insight into their true economic relations, focusing instead on personal gain. This is orchestrated by the ideological subjugation of the working class, evident in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. While the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, have no genuine will, they are driven to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one social class by another, is plainly illustrated here, with the lower classes unknowingly adhering to the capitalist and consumerist ideology. Upper classes, while capable of recognizing this, remain complacent, with few Alphas or Betas like Bernard asserting themselves. The interactions among social classes further highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, genuine relationships between individuals are absent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, perhaps suggesting that technology and capitalism strip humans of their free will and expression. Love and emotional extremes are non-existent, with interactions maintained on a superficial level, exemplified by men discussing women's physical attributes and women's casual remarks about their encounters. The societal classes' acceptance of their hierarchical status indicates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role in the community signifies the Marxist portrayal of the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be quite challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, quite literally at the easternmost edge of campus. Getting to classes in the Willard building, situated near the central hub, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in inclement weather, which is a regular occurrence in State College. Engaging in conversation with a recent graduate, I discovered that the East Halls dorms used to be separated from the rest of the campus by vast stretches of unused land. Now, this space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and residential apartments. As the campus continues to grow, mobility becomes increasingly difficult. What is the most effective solution to this issue? For college students, it is undoubtedly the bicycle. However, merely having bicycles available is insufficient. Students must embrace cycling, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nDiscussing this with a friend who recently restarted cycling after a hiatus, he remarked, \"Bikes are fantastic, especially for getting around campus.\" Unlike some trends, cycling remains the only practical means of transportation. Aside from its health benefits, it's also the most efficient method of travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, just as far from the central area as some dorms. The most intelligent decision I've made this year was investing in a bicycle. My daily class in Thomas building takes about 25 minutes on foot from my house, but riding a bike can reduce this to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The main drawback is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my home, isn't always the easiest road to traverse, whether by bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, my busy schedule makes it impractical. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my sole reliable option for attending classes. Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, amounting to over two and a half hours each week. Factor in the time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and various errands, and it's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.

We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.

            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.

This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.

Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my quest to pursue an education in the social work discipline, my ambition is to follow a career trajectory within the Division of Family and Children Services. The principal objective is to offer assistance to children who have endured abuse or neglect, and to extend support to troubled families. The values I can contribute to the social work field encompass service, respect for others, an ethical demeanor, a commitment to fostering stronger relationships between individuals, and a dedication to continuous professional growth to maintain competence in the field. These core values are not merely crucial to social workers; they are deeply ingrained in my personal being.\n\nThroughout my academic journey in high school and college, I have observed numerous individuals retreating from their problems through denial and embracing coping strategies that were suboptimal. These experiences have steered me towards pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, though I was still undecided about my future career path after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009. Taking a sabbatical after college, I visited a friend one summer. She introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who seemed anxious on her couch. She explained why he was there — to flee his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents' residence. Out of a desire to assist, I drove over to his parents' house. I discussed my concerns with the police, who asked me to speak with the parents since they were powerless to intervene legally. The parents appeared anxious and attributed their son's \"manipulative\" behavior for reaching out to outsiders to resolve \"trivial\" disagreements. This encounter sparked a serious consideration of a career in social work to assist children grappling with family disputes.\n\nMoreover, another value integral to social work is social justice. Society often asserts the importance of the individual and mourns those lost. Yet, the concept of the \"individual\" society holds is often a reflection of outdated traditions rather than unique qualities. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to conform to \"everyone else?\" I am an individual who rejects self-imposed limitations to fit societal norms. My high school and college years were marked by protests against social injustice: unnatural hair colors, distinctive clothing choices, multiple ear piercings beyond the norm, involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and advocating against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This essay delves into the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The Biological model centers around genetic traits and health conditions, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors and their connection to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This analysis explores these models, highlighting key research pieces that relate to and elucidate them. Each study's findings are then critically evaluated for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into Primary Sleep Disorders, Sleep Disorders linked to other mental conditions, or Sleep Disorders linked to medical issues or substance intake. Primary Sleep Disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, each present distinct challenges, such as difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder, involve unusual behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. Sleep issues related to mental disorders can stem from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and other primary sleep disorders as they relate to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetics, inheritance, and physiological aspects. Orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, which directly influence sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAergic system promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The use of a GABA agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in the study. This suggests that human sleep patterns may be influenced by similar genetic and environmental factors. A defective or absent receptor could disrupt sleep without medication, potentially impacting daily life and productivity.",
            "This composition delves into three primary facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise description of the disorder is offered. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is detailed, encompassing common indicators, also known as \"red flags\". Finally, the paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in an inclusive classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. In simpler terms, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process sounds it hears, despite normal hearing. Individuals with CAPD can hear clearly but face challenges in separating words or discerning speech from background noise.\n\nThe roots of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered diagnostic tools for children with communication disorders in 1954. Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and his model for the physiology of the central nervous system underlying dichotic perception in 1961 further advanced the field. A pivotal national conference in 1977 stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include difficulties in localizing sounds, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, discerning changes in speech, and synthesizing sound clues. In diagnosing CAPD, a systematic observation of the patient's listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests is crucial. While there is no single diagnostic test with high success rates, and no known cause for the disorder, various methods are employed to evaluate auditory-related skills. These typically involve questionnaires, observations, and tests that present multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli.",
            "In the play \"Twelfth Night,\" it appears that while disguise can serve as a means to perpetuate prolonged deception, ultimately, one must shed this new persona or risk losing oneself indefinitely. One significant hurdle in ending a deceptive ruse, however, is that it may lead to feelings of isolation. Consequently, one must choose between their self-preservation or the preservation of their relationships with others. Though some may react passively to the revelation of deception, others may take offense and be displeased with the entire charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly contentious, as it raises several interconnected issues. At its core is the question: Why does the individual feel compelled to abandon their true identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, her motivation is clear: self-protection. Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, she resolves to pose as a man for her safety. Her strategy succeeds, but it also isolates her from the female companionship she once had, leaving her unsupported. Moreover, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love with her. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,\" Olivia exclaims (5.1.138). Additionally, she experiences suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nWhile this may reflect a more open-minded attitude, to a contemporary audience, \"Twelfth Night\" can be seen as an example of how deception can uncover hidden emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because he appears male, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It is unlikely that this is the case, as Shakespeare's Olivia seems to parody those of her time who judge others solely on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in Olivia's swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: \"A sister, you are she,\" she declares (5.1.315).",
            "The harsh legacy of German colonial governance, particularly in German South West Africa, has been spotlighted by numerous observers due to the infamous Ovaherero and Nama atrocities. However, it would be reductive to attribute the vast German colonial empire's dynamics solely to this singular narrative. The empire's policies and governing styles were as varied as its geographical expanse. Educational initiatives, similarly, varied among colonies. While the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919 revealed a populace with considerable educational attainment, German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies also garnered favorable remarks from contemporaries. Conversely, the education landscape in South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where state schools played a significant role, native education in South West Africa was predominantly managed by missionary societies, with minimal government involvement. The colonial government, though, lavished resources on European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary institutions. These policies had enduring influences on South West Africa long after German rule. Contrarily, while other German colonies boasted substantial literate and educated populations, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. A multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to delve into these factors, with a particular focus on recent research into the views of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. Extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire exists, much of which is in German and hails from the early 20th century, during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works centered on describing educational systems, while later English-language works broadened the discussion with comparative studies and in-depth analyses. These studies revealed significant variations among educational systems in different colonies. Cohen's research on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a seminal work, comparing these colonies' educational systems and explaining the factors behind their differences. Cohen attributes many of South West Africa's distinguishing educational features to its large settler population. Compared to other German colonies, South West Africa possessed a moderately temperate climate, with many areas being arid desert. This climate brought a relatively hospitable environment for European settlers. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved over the past century to encompass a multitude of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Intricately, many genres, including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given rise to numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Notably, the Heavy Metal rock genre has emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive in the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from the wide array of emotions it conveys, often leaning towards the darker spectrum. This genre's diversity lies in its early recognition of adaptability, leading to the creation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nToday's Heavy Metal landscape is so fragmented that pinpointing a definitive definition of the genre is difficult. It has assimilated themes from various other genres but, like any movement, it has its roots. To comprehend the Metal music prevalent today, understanding the Metal movement and its distinction from a mere genre is crucial.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be deemed a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Less primitive, more proficient; musicians in Metal bands possess exceptional instrumental skills, evident in their music. Additionally, Metal is a movement that has been heavily influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s led to the recording of more intense, otherworldly music, with drugs serving as a catalyst for creativity. It embodies dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively new to the music scene, as many popular genres emphasized lighter emotions. Furthermore, later generations of Metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prevalent in the Romantic Era.\n\nLyrics such as the following exemplify the darkness inherent to this movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles illustrate the darker side of the band's music, mirroring the ups and downs of drug influence. This song is considered by some to be an early Heavy Metal track. It was a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones song, with The Beatles aiming to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity. The song was included on The White Album.",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists, a decade or so before their inception, Henri Rousseau was assiduously cultivating his own dreamscapes, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" is not merely a portrayal of a woman marveling at a dreamland's wonders, but also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and inner conflicts. For years, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and esteem from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but found himself grappling with a profound internal dilemma. Should he conform to or imitate established artistic styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own unique path, he pondered. \"The Dream\" encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle: the desire to be acknowledged versus the urge to remain creatively independent.\n\nTo fully appreciate \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, France, in 1844, he hailed from a humble background. His father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed modest success. Growing up, Rousseau lacked formal art education; instead, he worked as a gabelou for France until the age of forty. Known as the \"douanier,\" he was a customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with a daughter named Julia and profound sorrow, driving him to painting as a source of solace and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau did not sentimentally romanticize the peasant in his art; he was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of his class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for art world acceptance is reasonable when considered in context. He lacks formal training and began his artistic journey later in life, working alongside more renowned artists. He didn't receive due recognition until around the same time Matisse was making a name for himself. Author Jan Gordon notes that while both were rivals in the art world, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations: \"Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau aimed to create a conventional painting to secure admittance to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "In the realm of intellectual discourse, numerous minds have posited a deep affinity between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I hold the conviction that this affinity is grounded in an intrinsic essence. As the words of John Keats in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" aptly convey, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge is acquired through formal education or life's experiences, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seemingly transcends these conventional paths. Both ethics and aesthetics, it seems, seek to elucidate rather than dictate. Our explorations of morality and beauty are largely efforts to comprehend why a work of art or literature is deemed beautiful, or why an action is deemed moral, rather than rigid rules for assessment or creation. In essence, the criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate the essence of what is deemed good or beautiful. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance. A discourse on its value might delve into elements such as foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these elements do not encapsulate why it is considered a masterpiece. Often, when asked about a favored piece of art or literature, one hears phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more intricate or analytical explanation. I contend that both art and morality possess an ineffable quality, a je ne sais quoi, that cannot be fully captured in a description of their attributes. Ethics, much like art, possess a transcendental nature. As Wittgenstein puts it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable essence, this indescribable something, is what imbues art and morality with their power, and it is this transcendental connection between them that I believe unites ethics and aesthetics. The shared experience of morality and art is particularly potent at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term, impacting us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. The connection is especially profound in literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about it, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" Living necessitates the engagement with values, and literature holds importance precisely because of the values we find within it.",
            "Germany, a nation of today, is a robust, unified territory that boasts a distinctive cultural tapestry, woven together from the alpine landscapes of Munich to the Baltic Sea shores of Kiel. This unique heritage can be felt in cities like Cologne along the Rhine, traversing the heart of Germany, and the Saxon city of Dresden situated by the Elbe River. The diversity of Germany's culture is not surprising as it arises from a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral home of the Germans is Germania. The origins of the name are a subject of debate among scholars, with some attributing it to the Germanic tribe known historically as the Tungrians. Tacitus proposed that the Germans were so named due to their residence beyond the Rhine, engaging in frequent skirmishes with Gaulish forces. Alternatively, Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls under his control and those who remained unconquered. He derived this from the Gauls themselves, who employed it to differentiate their foes. Others suggest the name might come from the Old English word \"ger\" for their spear or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating their formidable nature.\n\nTacitus, in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" from AD 98, recorded that the Germans were considered autochthonous, having migrated by sea rather than land. He pondered why anyone would choose to live in the wild, harsh climate of Germania over more hospitable lands like Italy or Rome. Similarly, the Romans, while they occasionally ventured into Germania for resources and conquests, primarily returned to their empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to thrive on the borders.",
            "Gazing down at the tableau before me, my mind was as vacant as a blank canvas. Indifferently, without a hint of emotion, I scrutinized the scene, my analytical faculties at work, yet they remained detached from any cognitive comprehension. Ideas flitted in and out of my consciousness with such swiftness that it seemed I was merely experiencing an endless stream of external stimuli. The calm efficiency of my perception made me question if I even possessed thoughts of my own. Once, a colleague suggested that I acquire \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to enhance my artistic abilities. Ever since I was a child, I had been captivated by the idea of drawing, and this book offered insights into the brain's interpretation of lines and shapes. It introduced a technique of framing any subject of study within a square, transforming complex scenes into simpler, more manageable images. Standing there, overwhelmed by the intricate arrangement of a bowl of fruit on a table, I was unable to mentally impose such a frame. The awestruck wonder that filled me was akin to the initial stirrings of the artist's journey, the genesis of my own artistic odyssey, \"Brown's Genesis.\" My fingers touched the chosen tool of my art, and my muscles tensed and released in rhythm with my hand's motion through space, each stroke a testament to my will. Water swirled serenely, crystal clear and unblemished. Matter detached itself, floating away like embers from a dying flame. My hand, anxious and hurried in its second attempt, struck the toilet handle, but the offending package remained stubbornly in place, a slug-like obstruction. Mop in hand, feet firmly planted, a green tie uncomfortably encircling my neck, I scrutinized the offensive deposit. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping itself in layers until it resembled a thick, misshapen mop. Straightening up, bending at the waist, my hand lowered into the bowl, mirroring the actions of a cook preparing a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage fatalities on the road is a complex tapestry of contributing factors. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain's immaturity is a significant factor in this predicament. Inexperience, the cornerstone of teenage driving, exacerbates the issue, leading to a surge in fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, excessive speeding, and road deviations. Peer influence further amplifies the danger, as teenagers frequently drive with their peers, as any sensible individual would know. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center's study corroborates this, revealing a direct correlation between the passengers' age and the frequency of traffic incidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states have implemented provisional licenses to mitigate these risks, restricting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely patchwork solutions. The core problem lies in the fact that, collectively, teenagers are statistically unprepared to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman advocates for delaying driving age beyond 18 to allow the propensity for thrill-seeking to subside. By 2010, a new wave of teenage drivers, the 'Boomers' offspring, will hit the road, potentially escalating the fatality toll.\n\nA feasible legislative approach could see schools continue teaching driver's education to lay the foundation for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. Provisional permits would still be issued upon certain conditions, including practical training hours. The specific number could mirror current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult-supervised practice. A national uniform policy could effectively protect teenagers nationwide, as these fatalities transcend state boundaries.\n\nThe proposed legislation is far from innovative.",
            "While navigating the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a trove of fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films largely exploit creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily revolved around outlining the poetic elements present in the majority of these trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few later ones. The trick films of the late 19th century are predominantly set-bound, constrained within a static frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, and employing long and medium shots, adhering to the rigid rule of one shot equaling one film. However, a select few films from the early 20th century dare to diverge from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains steadfast in its position, adhering to a static viewpoint. This style draws upon theatrical and vaudeville traditions. One notable example is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame, never approaching or receding from the camera.\n\nThis static composition often results in long and, less frequently, medium shots, with close-ups being entirely absent. This echoes the theatrical and vaudeville convention, where the audience witnessed the entire performance simultaneously within the stage's borders. Actors typically remain in the middle ground, eschewing close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to a single film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricts their dramatic potential, favoring brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic and switching acts over complex narratives. However, a closer examination reveals that a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes may actually comprise multiple physical shots, joined to create illusions. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. A careful viewing reveals that the 'head' shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins midway through, though the film is perceived as one continuous shot.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republican principles in his era. While primarily an agriculturalist, his agricultural pursuits, combined with his brief political career, marked him as a man steadfast in his views on individual liberties and governance. His agrarian background deeply influenced his stances on sovereignty, the constitution, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed America's fledgling nationhood presented a unique chance to craft an ideal governance model, unhindered by native traditions. He strongly upheld the natural rights of individuals, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one compromises the value of all. These rights, he argued, should transcend the grasp of the government. He posited that in a state of nature, the physically strong and cunning benefited, but in civilization, this should not be the norm.\n\nTo achieve this utopian society, Taylor envisioned a government acknowledging the inherent good and evil in humanity. He advocated for a dualistic morality, asserting, \"As government is administered by man, its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He deemed good principles those that safeguard private property, advance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on such principles would operate justly despite its leaders' leadership, who, he believed, would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many Republicans of his time, championed strict constitutional interpretation. He advocated for a minimal Federal government, limited to the rights explicitly stated in the Constitution, citing the high cost and potential despotism of an extensive one. However, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation that could become corrupt without reference to the founders' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, a significant downturn in commuter log submissions occurred during the third month of the project, which was somewhat disconcerting. The onset of winter in New England likely contributed, as fewer people commuted by bicycle or foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity, and the holiday season, which could have led students and faculty to overlook the commuter log. The project faced the hurdle of sustaining momentum amidst seasonal breaks and the intrinsic appeal of driving. To address this, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March to rekindle enthusiasm, which indeed spurred an increase in log submissions. Another obstacle was the ingrained preference for driving, necessitating robust incentives. We offered gift certificates to local businesses and even considered more substantial prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, potentially boosting engagement. Altering prize value over time might have further bolstered participation. Initially, gift cards sufficed, but escalating the prize offerings could have mitigated the project's engagement decline.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument that mirrors the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on an exchange like stocks. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. However, ETFs are typically associated with lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. Nevertheless, they come with trade-offs, including commission fees for every transaction, akin to stock purchases. One of the standout features of ETFs is the wide range of available options.\n\nDespite the explicit benefits, it's prudent for a seasoned investor to scrutinize these advantages, particularly diversification, to ascertain their validity and degree. Here, we will assess the ETF IHF by comparing it to its top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how these top ten stocks reflect the entire ETF IHF, we will normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these ten stocks in the proportions dictated by the ETF's holdings. The results are as follows:\n\nIt's clear from the chart that a portfolio composed of just the top ten holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF as a whole, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer higher returns with a lower risk. However, it is essential to conduct further analysis to determine if these two portfolios exhibit statistically significant differences.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical differences, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize these values to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-claimed superior poems. Here, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used this term in reference to an island north of Britain, a vestige of the ancient world's edge. While Virgil indeed used this term, there's a more contemporary influence to consider. Poe, with his keen interest in German literature, likely drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nThis connection is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe may have been drawing upon Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the second part lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poem about a king who, after his wife's death, drinks heavily and eventually takes his own life. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both works depicting a king haunted by loss and grief.\n\nPoe references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses \"Thulé\" as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two poems can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely landscape, haunted by the specters of deceased friends, and devoid of color. This description resonates with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king, bereft of his wife, is consumed by loneliness and despair. It's as if the speaker of \"Dream-Land\" has stepped into Goethe's poem. Poe would have known of Goethe's work through Tennyson, whom he admired, or through the numerous reproductions that circulated after the original publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a patron injured by falling in a grocery store due to an applesauce spill be awarded punitive damages if the store manager, informed twice of the hazard, did not clean it within a half-hour because he was dining?\n\nGiven the circumstances, a judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's case for punitive damages. For such damages to be justified, evidence must be presented that the defendant's actions were deliberate and exhibited a disregard for potential harm, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the risk involved in not cleaning the spill, as multiple incidents of injury had occurred previously. However, while her argument that Martin's actions were outrageous may not be entirely compelling, it is still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and his failure to address them.\n\nOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 PM, an employee at D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, notified his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and couldn't handle the issue. At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the spill, with Martin responding similarly. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a severe back injury. Before this incident, five slip-and-fall reports had been filed at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a partial summary against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual wrongs if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for others' safety. Id. at § 3294(c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when it involves a conscious disregard of the probable consequences, demonstrating that the defendant \"willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. The class centered on a contentious debate: the question of whether Islam is inherently hostile. This query seems as pertinent today as ever. Post-9/11, the U.S. media's stance on Islam and extremism has evolved dramatically, shifting from hostility to an unprecedented level of tolerance. In 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim lineage, was unthinkable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography captivates me, yet it presents a discrepancy with his character. The historical Muhammad appeared coercive, forcefully converting tribes and imposing Islam. In contrast, his biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly attracting converts one by one. I find parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles,' such as multiplying mutton and milk for forty men. This narrative style diminishes Jesus' miracle and life, attributing his qualities to Muhammad. Moreover, many stories in the biography appear to serve as testimonials of voluntary conversions, but often relayed through third-hand accounts, which weakens their credibility. Most disturbingly, the work elevates Muhammad as a paragon of godliness, humility, wisdom, and gentleness, yet historical records contradict this portrayal, raising questions about the true nature of his rise to power.",
            "The tenets espoused by Jesus during his life were quickly eclipsed in the course of Christian thought's evolution post-mortem. Examining this trajectory on a grand scale, there's a discernible drift away from the religion's origins. The modern world, however, exhibits a burgeoning consciousness and an unparalleled progressive spirit. Meanwhile, traditionalists, steadfast in their beliefs, may not be numerous enough to sway the collective tide. Among Christians, historical comprehension is poised to expand significantly in the coming years. This understanding will fuel a yearning to disentangle the doctrines that have been interwoven into Christianity over time from the true spirit of its founder. This process, though gradual, is inevitable: a return to Christianity's original form. A movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding time, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to humanity remains. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing multitudes to worship as if living in Jesus' time, the church will remain steadfast as a guiding force. However, the theological pendulum will have swung back, resulting in a reduction of diversity and an increase in uniformity of belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and factional differences will give way to similarities. History is replete with such reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, only to see that empire later become Christian. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The imminent reversion in Christianity will similarly revert history, seeking the source and undoing diversity in the process. This transformation will be hastened by an interpretative shift, viewing Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. Thus, what has transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nTraversing history, we find only Judaism, the foundational theology for Christianity. At Jerusalem's Roman takeover in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divine revelation, and Hebrew scripture authority were at the core. Jewish society was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority common folk.",
            "I contend that The Jungle posits an inherent selfishness within humanity, where individuals prioritize their own advancement over the welfare of others. This is vividly illustrated by the factory owners and managers who strive to expand their enterprises with no regard for those who suffer in their wake. Their insatiable ambition is portrayed by Upton Sinclair, who depicts the factories as \"great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". The owners' apathy towards pollution and the well-being of the community is evident in their disregard for the pollution and waste generated by their operations. Furthermore, they prioritize profits over worker welfare, exploiting their employees with grueling work schedules and sudden layoffs, often leaving them without compensation or assistance in finding alternative employment. During the time The Jungle was set, there was a dearth of laws protecting workers' safety or well-being, enabling managers and owners to subjugate their workforce to subpar conditions. The workers in Packingtown were effectively trapped in this system, with no recourse for improvement or escape. The book subtly suggests that these workers were akin to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\". Hence, the narrative underscores the exploitation and suffering of the working class at the hands of unscrupulous employers.",
            "In literary works, authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific sentiments or attitudes towards significant themes. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys various techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, Fitzgerald couples adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create a certain ambiance around a subject. Furthermore, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently utilizes them to achieve similar ends. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald invests colors with significance, notably white/gray and red/pink, and employs these meanings later to evoke specific feelings associated with important objects.\n\nWhite/gray, for instance, is associated with uniformity, where white signifies elegance and higher social standing, while gray denotes age and weariness. Fitzgerald establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted in white—even Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby’s party, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick describes Gatsby’s party, where the halls are adorned with vibrant primary colors, standing in stark contrast to the uniformity of white.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by applying white/gray to ordinary subjects. Nick's journey to work is described as descending through \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), while the names on his timetable become \"gray names\" (61). Additionally, he colors mundane people and places with these hues: Daisy and Jordan shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child on the railroad (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy, who, after a prolonged absence of significant color use, is suddenly described as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" This portrayal diminishes Daisy's character, depicting her as a mere uniform addition—an object of Gatsby's longing. Fitzgerald continues this technique, emphasizing Daisy’s uniformity with a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her wearing a white dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County, renowned for its yielding agricultural landscape, thrives under a serene, sun-filled climate. The terrain is fertile with a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The area harbors a robust demand for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups boasting extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk, too, are highly sought after. Numerous organic farms invite visitors to observe their operations, offering hiking trails and birdwatching opportunities.\n\nThis type of farm operation can be advantageous for the landowner, as they can benefit from government initiatives while enhancing habitat and facilitating recreational activities, such as farm tours and educational programs. Organic farming, while beneficial for biodiversity in plants and wildlife, presents greater expenses compared to conventional farming. It demands more intensive labor and management to handle pests and weeds without chemicals, and yields can be less consistent. Additionally, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nThe chosen land, adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, measures 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. Historically, this area has been inhabited by Native Americans before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production.",
            "The role of culture in any negotiation is multifaceted and profound. Culture, often defined as much by what it isn't as what it is, is a complex and varied entity that isn't uniform or singular. It is not accurate to generalize about entire nations or groups, such as suggesting \"all Russians are tough\" or \"all Japanese are cooperative.\" While understanding broad cultural traits is beneficial, a negotiator should focus on the specific cultural elements relevant to the negotiation at hand, and how these elements may influence the dialogue and interactions. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, and comparisons are inevitable.\n\nDelving into a foreign culture or mindset can involve a range of activities from studying its background to recognizing its biases. Rather than evaluating or attempting to alter a culture, one must acknowledge it and operate within its confines, especially when at a negotiation table with a weaker bargaining stance. Respect for local traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural hurdles and propel the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that culture isn't confined to national or international boundaries. Many enterprises within a single country develop their unique corporate cultures, which can vary drastically. For example, some companies prioritize long office hours, while others promote a more laid-back schedule. Indicators of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication styles (ranging from direct to indirect), and hiring practices. Some businesses encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it to approved initiatives. Even within the United States, corporate cultures can differ significantly, with variations existing not only between companies but also within a single organization, depending on location, whether urban or suburban. Some cultures appear less stratified, but this uniformity can be deceiving; it may be an indication to explore further.\n\nValues are particularly significant to understand, as they provide the rationale behind a culture. If a culture values maintaining harmony or saving face, a negotiator will not publicly embarrass their company or superior to secure a deal. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes intense bargaining may not settle quickly. Being aware of these cultural tendencies before negotiation is crucial, but it's also beneficial to learn about the individual opponent to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The quotation, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" can be found at the beginning of Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and was also utilized by St. Anselm in his discourse on the existence of God. This belief appears to be shared by another influential thinker, Thomas Aquinas. To fairly assess which of these arguments is more persuasive, let us initially presume that both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God of the Bible. Adopting a different concept of a divine entity would complicate the comparison, as both arguments are centered around a specific divine being. However, neither argument offers a comprehensive foundation for believing in this particular deity.\n\nFirst, let us delve into the core argument of St. Anselm. His approach emphasizes introspection, suggesting that understanding God is found within one's own thoughts and understanding. He posits that God's existence is so inherently clear that it cannot be denied, as it is ingrained in our minds. This notion, while somewhat oblique, essentially argues that the proof for God lies within us, and no external evidence is required. This perspective is often referred to as faith within Christian tradition.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, advocates for a more rational approach. He contends that God's existence can be logically proven through empirical and rational means, without the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous in Christianity's mission of converting new adherents, as it relies solely on logical reasoning rather than the acceptance of unprovable ideas. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments to support his case, each demonstrating that the need for God is logically necessary. If one piece of a puzzle is missing, and the rest fit perfectly, logic dictates the existence of the missing piece, even without seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, during the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future sage, later known as the Buddha, emerged. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, resulting in the inception of Buddhism. This faith, with its most traditional branch known as Theravada, is approximately 2500 years old and has transformed significantly over time. For example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the ritual of the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, involving both monks and laypeople, despite the Buddha's teachings lacking any mention of such a celebration. These changes permeate the religion, from surface-level customs to its core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from the monastery or the laity, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both internal and external, friendly and unfriendly factors.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discourse. Internal forces refer to influences from fellow Buddhists, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to negative perceptions. Benign forces are those that do not wish to harm or aid the community, but may incidentally do so. These terms will recur throughout this discussion.\n\nTo begin, the fundamental elements of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism—should be examined. Buddhists find solace in the Triple Gem consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, or three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects. Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognition of these principles is necessary to liberate oneself from Sansara, the cycle of rebirth, and to eliminate lobha (desire), dosa (hate), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for life, with five precepts for laypeople (I will not kill, I will not lie, I will not steal, I will not engage in inappropriate sexual conduct, and I will not use intoxicants) and numerous rules for monks. The four noble truths form the most fundamental doctrinal concept. The first truth is that life is filled with suffering. The second is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico's relationship has been marked by a protracted rivalry extending over five and a half decades, from 1836 until 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the United States vanquished Mexico and acquired Texas and the southwestern territories. Throughout this period, numerous skirmishes occurred between the two nations, with tensions easing only in the aftermath of World War I. The roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental differences such as religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dynamic is not unique to the United States and Mexico; neighboring nations often experience similar rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find enduring, overarching American diplomatic challenges\" (p. 41). These nations, geographically proximate to the United States, have historically been rivals, whereas other Latin American countries have enjoyed more harmonious relations. Religious tensions, a recurrent theme in international relations, played a significant role in this rivalry. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86), much like the ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, where the conflict was part political and part a battle over key interests. These tensions were exacerbated by the enduring mistrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial past. This mutual mistrust was a formidable obstacle to the development of cordial diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period, the majority of which were territorial in nature. Issues such as border raids by outlaws and bandits from American towns into Mexican territory remained a persistent problem until both nations imposed military control over their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). The rivalry began to abate as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States economically (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109). This dependence, coupled with a shift in American ambition from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt, 1974, p. 110), marked the end of the rivalry in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen and crippling ailment struck me down abruptly, a condition I had been wholly unaware of. At that time, I was employed as a nurse, a profession I had chosen to ensure the security and stability I had known as a child. \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill,\" I heard repeatedly as I grew older. Thus, I opted for nursing over my dreams of becoming a scientist or a journalist, a blend of both. Yet, here I was at 46, unmarried, penniless, and unable to work. My disability persists to this day, and after 15 years of Social Security Disability payments, I possess nothing that is truly mine. The daily struggle has eroded my sense of security, safety, and self-worth, leaving me with no certainties in life. Still, I am convinced that I would not have endured these years without my family's and a few friends' support, as strong as I was. In truth, when calamity strikes, strength fades quickly.\n\nI believe that emergencies, big or small, are a constant in life. Despite thorough planning, some crises are insurmountable alone. I concur that we should not place all our faith in the crumbling government structure. However, I advocate that Americans learn to trust and support one another again, rather than each individual hoarding resources like a lone survivor.\n\nThe notion of rugged individualism, often championed by the American right, is a myth. Our forefathers' resilience in hard times stemmed from empathy, mutual respect, and resource sharing, not isolation. The pioneers who journeyed across the Rockies did not reach the coast alone. They relied on community and cooperation.\n\nWhile I advocate preparedness—disaster kits, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and so on—I also urge you to foster relationships with your neighbors. Let us rebuild our communities and aid one another, for that is how we shall weather storms.",
            "The query of why organisms evolve in specific ways and the constraints that guide this evolution has been a perplexing one since D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 assertion that even the simplest organic forms remain undefined in mathematical terms. However, recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to various biological phenomena, including the development of mollusk shells through both their growth and evolutionary history. Our investigation aims to merge mathematical models of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum species with experimental data to uncover the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary changes. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model potential and actual shell morphologies in software like CerioShell. These results are then harmonized with experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell is essentially a three-dimensional structure that evolves along a 360-degree path in space over time. These loops or turns in the shell are called whorls, which spiral around a central imaginary axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the final one, called the body whorl. The spire comprises all whorls except the last, with the apex being the spire's tip and the opposite end called the base. The aperture is the opening through which the animal emerges from the shell.\n\nShells can be examined from various angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The typical view is an apertural one, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the start of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, approximating to a quarter whorl where necessary.\n\nShells can also be perceived as a sequence of apertures that traverse through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The trajectory of the aperture can be visually and mathematically tracked using coordinates of the aperture centers and the horizontal and vertical radii. Once mathematically formulated, these parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have remained largely unchanged. Although the country is making strides towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, it's falling significantly short in improving child and maternal health indicators to meet 2015 goals. Multiple factors underlie these shortcomings, suggesting a need to bolster Indonesia's overall healthcare system rather than solely relying on specific program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has shown progress in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot handle medical interventions in complicated pregnancies. Thus, maternal deaths from hemorrhage remain high, indicating there's still much ground to cover. Additionally, there's been a decrease in the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Postnatal care data is incomplete but reveals low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than anticipated, at approximately 4%. This disparity is more pronounced in rural areas, where rates drop to 2%. This disparity highlights inequities in healthcare access, with urban areas receiving more attention. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting the poor face significant challenges affording healthcare.\n\nWhen considering improvements to neonatal and maternal care, the primary question is how to best address the lack of adequate services. Should Indonesia focus on targeted program-specific approaches or build up its overall healthcare system? Vertical, targeted approaches offer defined, manageable goals and faster results. However, they can lead to uneven funding distribution and human resource allocation, as seen in HIV/AIDS and family planning sectors. Moreover, they can result in duplicated, uncoordinated services, increasing paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the elite society of the era. Two works that diverge from this standard are 'Oliver Twist' and 'Wuthering Heights'. Both employ an element of intrigue and eccentricity, uncommon in their contemporaries, which deepens the characters' profiles and provides insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist is engulfed by the cacophony of sounds and lights, he is suddenly overwhelmed by a vivid recollection of his past experiences, seemingly trapped in a constant state of confusion and disorientation. The passage delves into his inner turmoil, depicting a sense of helplessness and desperation as he is unable to exert control over his circumstances. The shooting sequence, revisited in chapter 28, is a stark reminder of his vulnerability and the lack of agency he possesses over his life. As he relives the traumatic event, he is once again engulfed by despair, reflecting the growing influence of Fagin over him. This sequence underscores the notion that Oliver is powerless to alter his fate, reinforcing his sense of defeat as he is forced to accept his circumstances.\n\nThe temporal distortion in the passage is evocative, depicting a cycle of day and night that seems to blur together, suggesting an unending loop of suffering. The relentless repetition of the day and night sequence mirrors the repetitive nature of Oliver's existence, highlighting his trapped and desolate state.",
            "Several years back, I was involved in an after-school program aimed at tutoring elementary-aged students. My forte was English and reading, but I did my best to assist them in any subject they struggled with. A colleague approached me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. Initially, his issues seemed unusual as he could pronounce some letters correctly while others were entirely off the mark. He was of Latino descent and spoke fluent English, yet his reading comprehension was problematic. A significant breakthrough occurred when I met his mother. She entered the building while I was temporarily supervising a few children remaining after a field trip. Despite speaking only Spanish, we managed to communicate thanks to my limited Spanish skills. It then became clear that Adrian was not having trouble reading but rather with recognizing the English alphabet.\n\nI share this anecdote to emphasize the challenges posed by language barriers in educational settings, particularly in California. Even though Adrian spoke perfect English, he faced significant hurdles in reading due to his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This highlights that reading difficulties can be more complex than they initially appear.\n\nTo address this issue, a multi-faceted approach is crucial. For instance, the dual language system offers numerous benefits, not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research has shown that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. Yet, fears persist that such programs waste resources and do not benefit the majority of students. However, implementing these programs as the standard could provide advantages to all. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual. Instead, we can employ bilingual aids or tutors to support the students.",
            "Since our earliest memories, many of us are imbued with the notion of something greater than our individual selves, something that transcends our ability to grasp fully. Some are catechized in Sunday school, while others engage in religious rituals or introspection. Inheriting beliefs from our predecessors is common, yet some cast off these traditions, asserting their singular worldview. Our journeys to construct our spiritual identities are as varied as the paths we tread. We seek guidance to navigate the darkness and emerge into the light.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father replied to my query about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, the rain's rhythmic patter on the tin roof echoing our quiet conversation as we shared cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain, quenching the thirsty plants along the porch edge. His gaze, a mix of curiosity and reminiscence, shifted between the downpour and the distant horizon. His once robust figure had grown gaunt; his once thick hair had thinned. His avoidance of my gaze was palpable, a chasm between us. I felt isolated, anxious, and unable to express my fears to him. Instead, I moved closer, wrapping him in a silent embrace, our shared silence punctuated only by the symphony of the rain.\n\nFather passed in December, days after my twenty-second birthday. The extended survival, facilitated by chemotherapy and radiation, bought time, yet it only prolonged his suffering. The worth of this time was elusive to me. If a divine entity existed, I thought, it had abandoned me. In the stillness of the night, I refrained from prayer. If God listened, it was not to me.\n\nI chose not to witness his transition. The thought of observing the creator of my life was too much to bear. I yearned to recall him through the prism of his life, not his passing. I retreated into a cocoon of solitude, curling up in my bed for three days, awaiting news that never came. The silence was deafening, echoing the emptiness I felt.",
            "The quintessential \"Gothic Novel,\" as \"Old-New\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has been alternately dismissed and celebrated, labeled as lacking depth while simultaneously praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). At its inception, the \"Gothic Novel\" drew from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to birth a new literary form, as exemplified by Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole merged \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' naturalistic mimicry in his portrayal of \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, rooted in medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, paradoxically became associated with outdated or primitive sensibilities despite the 'modern' advancements it represented. This fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's personal character psychology ensured its enduring appeal, rendering it both obsolete and fresh to readers separated by time from its original inception.\n\nOne persistent theme in Gothic literature is the idealization of chivalry, a concept rooted in medieval knight training. The Gothic novel, particularly The Castle of Otranto, retained and transformed this medieval notion. Chivalry's appeal to Gothic writers lay in its embodiment of the brave, honorable, and competent knight, a stark contrast to their perception of contemporary society's lack of these qualities. By incorporating chivalric elements, the \"gothic past\" was romanticized and used as a critique and aspiration for the present. Walpole, writing in a politically fraught era, may have felt that the supposed moral goodness of the Gothic age had been lost in his contemporaries. This is evident in his character, Frederic, who exemplifies chivalric traits before ever meeting him. Described as a prince, one who has endured tragedy, and a presumed victim of infidels, Frederic embodies the soon-to-be iconic trope of Gothic excess.",
            "The flow of logistics, from initial procurement of raw materials through to delivery to the end-user, constitutes a supply chain's operations. This concept, coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, involves the strategic oversight and management of this sequence to fulfill customer needs rapidly and effectively. The supply chain comprises six critical facets: production, procurement, inventory, location, transport, and data exchange. Business leaders harness these components to deliver superior customer service.\n\nProduction is the cornerstone of the supply chain process. It sets the foundation for all subsequent stages. Production planning involves determining when, why, where, and how products will be made. Understanding customer preferences is paramount for effective production. Market analysis provides valuable insights into consumer demand. Once demand is understood, decisions on product types and quantities to produce can be made. Location selection for production is crucial, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Production scheduling and equipment maintenance follow, ensuring efficiency and minimizing long-term costs. Consistent procedural guidelines, like those employed by Wal-Mart and Target, promote smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second essential aspect of supply chain management is procurement. Procurement strategies aim to establish a facility's core capabilities and foster strategic partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division suits various manufacturing processes best. Outsourcing to external partners can enhance flexibility and reduce costs without compromising quality, thereby accelerating the supply chain.",
            "A mysterious sign reads, \"Hitler Survives in Burmese Territory.\" Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a bustling city street, a hastily made cardboard sign held aloft. The sign bears a chilling message, written in bold, black lettering. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military regime, which seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, public protests, led by Buddhist monks, erupted, marking the first demonstrations after a decade of silence. These peaceful gatherings, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" for the monks' robes, attracted widespread attention. Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather, but violence escalated, with monasteries raided, foreign journalists imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, killed.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have suppressed dissent and asserted complete control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current leader, George W. Bush, has reportedly conferred with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a division of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, activists, and students were met with a violent crackdown by the Chinese government. The death toll varies greatly, from 200 to 3,000. Another tragic example is the 1994 Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia, aided by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates. And who could forget the horrors of Hitler's Third Reich, a period of mass killings targeting Jewish individuals across Europe.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his sustained career and his ability to mold his orchestra. His piano presence, though often subtle, is eclipsed by his prowess as a composer. Ellington excelled in crafting intricate pieces that spotlighted individual musicians' talents, providing structured frameworks for solos and integrating unique musical ideas. He prioritized ensemble cohesion and the distinctive tones of each member, resulting in groundbreaking and brilliant compositions. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as an instrument, demonstrated in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he employed vocal textures and colors without lyrics. This piece showcases his knack for complementing soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. \"Creole Love Call\" features six choruses, each characterized by distinct call-and-response dynamics and solo instruments. Ellington's use of voice as a solo instrument, as seen in the growl technique, adds depth to his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington showcases his orchestration skills and keen ear for tone color. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing harmonizes vocal elements of Miley's playing with instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. Similarly, in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington masterfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she harbored an insatiable longing, a void that refused to be satiated. At fourteen, it began, and though three years had passed, it remained, now a yearning for connection rather than a thing. Boys her peers found intriguing, but none piqued her interest. She pondered this perplexing conundrum often, her curiosity unabated. Her life was typically uneventful, her parents a pair of serene individuals, their disagreements rare and confined to her assertions of independence. Yet, today was different.\n\nAs she traversed the house, searching for inspiration, a piercing scream echoed from the kitchen. Her heart pounded as she rushed in, desperation etched on her face. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, moaning softly. She knelt beside her, concern etched on her face. \"Mom, can you tell me where to take you?\" Her mother, her voice strained, directed her to the car. With her mother's instructions, she hoisted her into the back seat, climbing behind the wheel. The hospital, a sterile and foreboding place, was her destination.\n\nThe doctor's verdict revealed her mother had fallen from a stool while attempting to reach a high shelf.",
            "This investigation aimed to demonstrate the link between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), represented by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is essentially a tweaked version of the Med diet, emphasizing higher intake of plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, swapping monounsaturated fats for saturated fats and including fish, while lowering consumption of animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol intake permitted. Prior research has shown an inverse correlation between following a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and a clinical trial revealed the Med diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, previous studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis longitudinal study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, free of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times over 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess yearly nutrient intake. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation over the 20-year period, with FFQs validated through studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Cases lacking records were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Variables like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone therapy use were assessed for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity added beginning in 1986.\n\nTo mitigate random variation for individuals and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed, averaging scores from two prior years. Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 strokes, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, a severe financial catastrophe struck the United States. Joblessness surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous major American corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent a recurrence? Essentially, the financial crisis was the result of shortsighted and self-serving political choices that coerced banks and firms into providing subprime loans within an inadequate and unready financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks were lacking sufficient capital reserves and transferred the ensuing tumult to the repacked mortgages they had sold, further contaminating the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration's 1999 policies. Seeking a second term, the president relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move set the stage for the subprime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, felt increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals, while also facing stockholder demands to maintain its remarkable profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the repercussions of these actions: “Yet, the government-subsidized corporation may encounter difficulties in an economic downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to the one provided to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As anticipated in the introduction, ill-considered lending practices ultimately precipitated the economic collapse.\n\nA multitude of factors conspired to plunge the economy into turmoil, one of them being the new and convoluted mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years preceding the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This overleveraging left U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities in a precarious position. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing about 30% of the U.S. GDP. Consequently, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a loss, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the introduction phase.  That section in your narrative where you spread your creative wings and captivate your audience with your enchanting, almost spellbinding composition.  Or perhaps it's the part where your readers nod off or hit the \"back\" button, swearing under their breath at the sheer dreariness of it all.  Dr. M. has been known to mutter unpleasantries at her screen when she encounters an excess of background details, and not the enjoyable kind.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already aware of the fundamental writing guideline, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. M. still finds herself ensnared in lengthy stretches of prose where nothing occurs, or worse, an overload of information.  Exposition is that pesky whisper in your ear that persuades you to squeeze in the backstory to get to the juicier bits (not to be mistaken for the voice suggesting you reveal every intimate detail of your characters' pasts).\n\nExposition signifies relaying information to the audience, usually in straightforward language.  In film, it's when one character shares extensive knowledge with another, similar to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, you're the one doing the sharing.\n\nConsider this instance.  As you read a tale, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific location and time, wedded him in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed in her presence.  You wouldn't anticipate this entire sequence to occupy two pages, during which they barely utter a word each.  You'd anticipate the author to dedicate time to fleshing out the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior the depth of his affection for his wife, and to equally illustrate the heroine's transformation and enhancement due to his presence (especially if the story later states it outright).  A proper introduction of the husband's character would foster empathy for his demise and give insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the strength of their bond, reflections of her thoughts and beliefs and dreams through his lens, and so forth.  You'd mourn his loss with her, and thereby become more connected to her.\n\nIn essence, you should offer substance to the simple skeleton of the plot: \"They met, they wed, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance.  (*glances at metaphor, sighs, presses forward*)  Sometimes, the temptation is strong to hurry past certain elements.  Maybe you're introducing a new character and know he served in the military, now runs a gas station at night, was married twice, no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly yearns to own the station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The initial one, aired live on August 13, 2011, was from NBC 4. The primary story was about an incident in Ashley, Ohio, involving a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife. The report was brief, lasting approximately two minutes, and provided minimal details. The second story was about an early morning shooting of a 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The story was brief, and I suspect this could be attributed to the involvement of a minority. I've observed a pattern where stories involving minorities are often given less attention. For instance, if a white child or adult is involved in a crime, the media coverage is extensive, but when it's a minority, it's fortunate if it gets any mention at all. Another story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, believed to be caused by a .22 caliber rifle. A reward of five thousand dollars was offered for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The weather forecast mentioned rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This story was short but served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. A story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF store featured a dark-skinned black man as the suspect. The report emphasized his race and physical description, which seemed excessive. Another story mentioned a convicted Texas drug lord, Rene Rodriguez, known for distributing large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they stated \"300\" months, which I found peculiar. They also highlighted his Hispanic background, which seemed unrelated to the story.",
            "A kinship between siblings, unyielding and constant, holds a myriad of feelings: affection, arrogance, envy, and harshness, among others. They comprehend one another deeply, more so than anyone else bound by such a tie, and when they gaze upon their brother, they glimpse their own soul. It's in the gravest of moments that this bond reveals its true essence, whether it be benign or malevolent. These sentiments, when exposed, exact a severe toll. Part of grappling with the feelings born of this fraternal connection is confronting their aftermath. When one peers into the eyes of a brother, they behold not their reflection as others may see it, but as they truly are. Their actions and the repercussions thereof unveil their genuine nature. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Traversing a vividly described terrain, these two boys embark on a doomed voyage. A clash of bitter disappointment and fierce pride unfolds in the culminating scene, and only one brother survives. This theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their exchanges, as well as the narrator's perspective, which elucidates the intricate emotions Doodle experiences and his view of the world around him, both of which significantly shape his behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to one overriding emotion: haughtiness. From their initial outings together to their final, calamitous trip, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could learn all of his expertise, such as holding his breath, running, jumping, or scaling the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He longed for a companion who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing and perch with him at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's frailty, a result of his weak heart, made these expectations unachievable. Doodle was not capable of participating in strenuous activities, much less surviving. The young protagonist's dreams were shattered, and he even contemplated killing Doodle by suffocating him with a pillow. But when the child smiled at him, his heart softened. This act of kindness, so simple yet powerful, offered the protagonist a glimmer of hope, suggesting that his initial intent may not have been deeply rooted. In the depths of his heart, he held an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain, an intricate and imaginative data manipulator, has witnessed shifts in its metaphors as technology evolved from rudimentary to contemporary forms. It was initially likened to a wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, followed by a book, and finally, a computer. As one delves into the intricacies of the mind, it's crucial to recognize the limitations and potential pitfalls of these analogies.\nInformation journey begins with sensory organs, which convert external stimuli into electrical signals. This data is continually transformed by the brain's algorithms through dual pathways: bottom-up and top-down. For instance, perceiving a black box on a white background involves piecing together simple data like color, direction, and edges to determine the object's shape. Top-down processing aids in faster recognition by utilizing prior decisions to identify the object. For example, it helps distinguish a black box from a box-shaped void in the background.\nAfter initial processing, an attention gate sorts the relevance and accessibility of signals. While the brain processes every blade of grass upon gazing at one's shoes, a healthy attention gate filters out individual blades. Conversely, even in a noisy environment, one can pick out their name. Multiple processing stages repeat this attention modulation.\nData retention is crucial for the brain's operation. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies by stimuli type, such as structural, phonemic, or semantic. Information is maintained through various means, with working memory potentially sustained by brief electrical loops among neurons, and long-term memory potentially retained in specific protein structures.\nDiverse models propose differing ways to structure knowledge in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysics. The semantic network model posits that concepts are node-like entities connected based on their relationships. For example, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can further connect to \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" presents a prospective threat posed by both technology and capitalism, engendering a dystopian society where communal interests supersede individuality. Citizens are indoctrinated from birth to prioritize immediate gratification, serving as pawns in a grand scheme controlled by the World Controller. This dystopia, scrutinized through a Marxist lens, reveals Huxley's concerns about the burgeoning economic systems of his era. Key Marxist concepts like homogeneity and reification underscore the critique of economic flaws in Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which denies the common populace insight into their true economic relations, focusing instead on personal gain. This is orchestrated by the ideological subjugation of the working class, evident in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. While the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, have no genuine will, they are driven to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one social class by another, is plainly illustrated here, with the lower classes unknowingly adhering to the capitalist and consumerist ideology. Upper classes, while capable of recognizing this, remain complacent, with few Alphas or Betas like Bernard asserting themselves. The interactions among social classes further highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, genuine relationships between individuals are absent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, perhaps suggesting that technology and capitalism strip humans of their free will and expression. Love and emotional extremes are non-existent, with interactions maintained on a superficial level, exemplified by men discussing women's physical attributes and women's casual remarks about their encounters. The societal classes' acceptance of their hierarchical status indicates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role in the community signifies the Marxist portrayal of the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be quite challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, quite literally at the easternmost edge of campus. Getting to classes in the Willard building, situated near the central hub, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in inclement weather, which is a regular occurrence in State College. Engaging in conversation with a recent graduate, I discovered that the East Halls dorms used to be separated from the rest of the campus by vast stretches of unused land. Now, this space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and residential apartments. As the campus continues to grow, mobility becomes increasingly difficult. What is the most effective solution to this issue? For college students, it is undoubtedly the bicycle. However, merely having bicycles available is insufficient. Students must embrace cycling, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nDiscussing this with a friend who recently restarted cycling after a hiatus, he remarked, \"Bikes are fantastic, especially for getting around campus.\" Unlike some trends, cycling remains the only practical means of transportation. Aside from its health benefits, it's also the most efficient method of travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, just as far from the central area as some dorms. The most intelligent decision I've made this year was investing in a bicycle. My daily class in Thomas building takes about 25 minutes on foot from my house, but riding a bike can reduce this to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The main drawback is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my home, isn't always the easiest road to traverse, whether by bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, my busy schedule makes it impractical. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my sole reliable option for attending classes. Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, amounting to over two and a half hours each week. Factor in the time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and various errands, and it's more time than I can spare."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my quest to pursue an education in the social work discipline, my ambition is to follow a career trajectory within the Division of Family and Children Services. The principal objective is to offer assistance to children who have endured abuse or neglect, and to extend support to troubled families. The values I can contribute to the social work field encompass service, respect for others, an ethical demeanor, a commitment to fostering stronger relationships between individuals, and a dedication to continuous professional growth to maintain competence in the field. These core values are not merely crucial to social workers; they are deeply ingrained in my personal being.\n\nThroughout my academic journey in high school and college, I have observed numerous individuals retreating from their problems through denial and embracing coping strategies that were suboptimal. These experiences have steered me towards pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, though I was still undecided about my future career path after graduation from Piedmont College in 2009. Taking a sabbatical after college, I visited a friend one summer. She introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who seemed anxious on her couch. She explained why he was there — to flee his abusive parents. The next day, I learned he had called the police to his parents' residence. Out of a desire to assist, I drove over to his parents' house. I discussed my concerns with the police, who asked me to speak with the parents since they were powerless to intervene legally. The parents appeared anxious and attributed their son's \"manipulative\" behavior for reaching out to outsiders to resolve \"trivial\" disagreements. This encounter sparked a serious consideration of a career in social work to assist children grappling with family disputes.\n\nMoreover, another value integral to social work is social justice. Society often asserts the importance of the individual and mourns those lost. Yet, the concept of the \"individual\" society holds is often a reflection of outdated traditions rather than unique qualities. If society mourns lost individuals, why do we strive to conform to \"everyone else?\" I am an individual who rejects self-imposed limitations to fit societal norms. My high school and college years were marked by protests against social injustice: unnatural hair colors, distinctive clothing choices, multiple ear piercings beyond the norm, involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), and advocating against racism and discrimination. I believe in social justice and will continue to stand against social injustice.",
            "This essay delves into the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The Biological model centers around genetic traits and health conditions, while the Sociocultural model examines environmental factors and their connection to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This analysis explores these models, highlighting key research pieces that relate to and elucidate them. Each study's findings are then critically evaluated for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized into Primary Sleep Disorders, Sleep Disorders linked to other mental conditions, or Sleep Disorders linked to medical issues or substance intake. Primary Sleep Disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias, such as Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, each present distinct challenges, such as difficulties in initiating or maintaining sleep. Parasomnias, like Nightmare Disorder and Sleepwalking Disorder, involve unusual behaviors or physiological occurrences during sleep. Sleep issues related to mental disorders can stem from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). This review primarily focuses on insomnia and other primary sleep disorders as they relate to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetics, inheritance, and physiological aspects. Orexin-producing neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A study on mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons, which directly influence sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAergic system promotes sleep, and its inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. The use of a GABA agonist, baclofen, increased sleep time in the study. This suggests that human sleep patterns may be influenced by similar genetic and environmental factors. A defective or absent receptor could disrupt sleep without medication, potentially impacting daily life and productivity.",
            "This composition delves into three primary facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Initially, a concise description of the disorder is offered. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is detailed, encompassing common indicators, also known as \"red flags\". Finally, the paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in an inclusive classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCAPD, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the efficiency and effectiveness of the central nervous system (CNS) in utilizing auditory information. In simpler terms, it is a condition where the brain struggles to process sounds it hears, despite normal hearing. Individuals with CAPD can hear clearly but face challenges in separating words or discerning speech from background noise.\n\nThe roots of CAPD can be traced back to the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered diagnostic tools for children with communication disorders in 1954. Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and his model for the physiology of the central nervous system underlying dichotic perception in 1961 further advanced the field. A pivotal national conference in 1977 stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nManifestations of CAPD include difficulties in localizing sounds, distinguishing between sounds, recognizing sound patterns, discerning changes in speech, and synthesizing sound clues. In diagnosing CAPD, a systematic observation of the patient's listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests is crucial. While there is no single diagnostic test with high success rates, and no known cause for the disorder, various methods are employed to evaluate auditory-related skills. These typically involve questionnaires, observations, and tests that present multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli.",
            "In the play \"Twelfth Night,\" it appears that while disguise can serve as a means to perpetuate prolonged deception, ultimately, one must shed this new persona or risk losing oneself indefinitely. One significant hurdle in ending a deceptive ruse, however, is that it may lead to feelings of isolation. Consequently, one must choose between their self-preservation or the preservation of their relationships with others. Though some may react passively to the revelation of deception, others may take offense and be displeased with the entire charade.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender role reversal is particularly contentious, as it raises several interconnected issues. At its core is the question: Why does the individual feel compelled to abandon their true identity and adopt a disguise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, her motivation is clear: self-protection. Having arrived in an unfamiliar land, she resolves to pose as a man for her safety. Her strategy succeeds, but it also isolates her from the female companionship she once had, leaving her unsupported. Moreover, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and fall in love with her. \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,\" Olivia exclaims (5.1.138). Additionally, she experiences suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nWhile this may reflect a more open-minded attitude, to a contemporary audience, \"Twelfth Night\" can be seen as an example of how deception can uncover hidden emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain scenes suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that Viola/Cesario's appearance forces them to confront. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because he appears male, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? It is unlikely that this is the case, as Shakespeare's Olivia seems to parody those of her time who judge others solely on appearances.\n\nThis is evident in Olivia's swift shift in romantic affections from Cesario to Sebastian, and her subsequent view of Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: \"A sister, you are she,\" she declares (5.1.315).",
            "The harsh legacy of German colonial governance, particularly in German South West Africa, has been spotlighted by numerous observers due to the infamous Ovaherero and Nama atrocities. However, it would be reductive to attribute the vast German colonial empire's dynamics solely to this singular narrative. The empire's policies and governing styles were as varied as its geographical expanse. Educational initiatives, similarly, varied among colonies. While the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919 revealed a populace with considerable educational attainment, German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies also garnered favorable remarks from contemporaries. Conversely, the education landscape in South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where state schools played a significant role, native education in South West Africa was predominantly managed by missionary societies, with minimal government involvement. The colonial government, though, lavished resources on European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary institutions. These policies had enduring influences on South West Africa long after German rule. Contrarily, while other German colonies boasted substantial literate and educated populations, South West Africa remained largely untouched, uneducated, and illiterate. A multitude of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this disparity. This paper aims to delve into these factors, with a particular focus on recent research into the views of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans. Extensive literature on education in the German colonial empire exists, much of which is in German and hails from the early 20th century, during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works centered on describing educational systems, while later English-language works broadened the discussion with comparative studies and in-depth analyses. These studies revealed significant variations among educational systems in different colonies. Cohen's research on education in South West Africa and East Africa stands out as a seminal work, comparing these colonies' educational systems and explaining the factors behind their differences. Cohen attributes many of South West Africa's distinguishing educational features to its large settler population. Compared to other German colonies, South West Africa possessed a moderately temperate climate, with many areas being arid desert. This climate brought a relatively hospitable environment for European settlers. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved over the past century to encompass a multitude of genres, making it challenging to enumerate them all. Intricately, many genres, including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given rise to numerous sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. Notably, the Heavy Metal rock genre has emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive in the past four decades. Its expressiveness stems from the wide array of emotions it conveys, often leaning towards the darker spectrum. This genre's diversity lies in its early recognition of adaptability, leading to the creation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres, a process that continues to this day.\n\nToday's Heavy Metal landscape is so fragmented that pinpointing a definitive definition of the genre is difficult. It has assimilated themes from various other genres but, like any movement, it has its roots. To comprehend the Metal music prevalent today, understanding the Metal movement and its distinction from a mere genre is crucial.\n\nMetal, in many ways, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be deemed a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatricality. Less primitive, more proficient; musicians in Metal bands possess exceptional instrumental skills, evident in their music. Additionally, Metal is a movement that has been heavily influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70s led to the recording of more intense, otherworldly music, with drugs serving as a catalyst for creativity. It embodies dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively new to the music scene, as many popular genres emphasized lighter emotions. Furthermore, later generations of Metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral qualities prevalent in the Romantic Era.\n\nLyrics such as the following exemplify the darkness inherent to this movement:\n\nThese lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles illustrate the darker side of the band's music, mirroring the ups and downs of drug influence. This song is considered by some to be an early Heavy Metal track. It was a response to a heavier, darker Rolling Stones song, with The Beatles aiming to demonstrate their ability to match the Stones' intensity. The song was included on The White Album.",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealist artists, a decade or so before their inception, Henri Rousseau was assiduously cultivating his own dreamscapes, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" is not merely a portrayal of a woman marveling at a dreamland's wonders, but also a reflection of Rousseau's own aspirations and inner conflicts. For years, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and esteem from fellow artists and art enthusiasts, but found himself grappling with a profound internal dilemma. Should he conform to or imitate established artistic styles to gain acceptance, or forge his own unique path, he pondered. \"The Dream\" encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle: the desire to be acknowledged versus the urge to remain creatively independent.\n\nTo fully appreciate \"The Dream\" from this perspective, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, France, in 1844, he hailed from a humble background. His father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed modest success. Growing up, Rousseau lacked formal art education; instead, he worked as a gabelou for France until the age of forty. Known as the \"douanier,\" he was a customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with a daughter named Julia and profound sorrow, driving him to painting as a source of solace and new beginnings. Unlike his contemporaries, Rousseau did not sentimentally romanticize the peasant in his art; he was a folk painter with the hopes and dreams of his class.\n\nRousseau's yearning for art world acceptance is reasonable when considered in context. He lacks formal training and began his artistic journey later in life, working alongside more renowned artists. He didn't receive due recognition until around the same time Matisse was making a name for himself. Author Jan Gordon notes that while both were rivals in the art world, they differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations: \"Matisse feared painting tritely, while Rousseau aimed to create a conventional painting to secure admittance to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "In the realm of intellectual discourse, numerous minds have posited a deep affinity between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I hold the conviction that this affinity is grounded in an intrinsic essence. As the words of John Keats in his poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" aptly convey, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge is acquired through formal education or life's experiences, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seemingly transcends these conventional paths. Both ethics and aesthetics, it seems, seek to elucidate rather than dictate. Our explorations of morality and beauty are largely efforts to comprehend why a work of art or literature is deemed beautiful, or why an action is deemed moral, rather than rigid rules for assessment or creation. In essence, the criticism of art or morals can never fully encapsulate the essence of what is deemed good or beautiful. Take the Mona Lisa, for instance. A discourse on its value might delve into elements such as foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but ultimately, these elements do not encapsulate why it is considered a masterpiece. Often, when asked about a favored piece of art or literature, one hears phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding a more intricate or analytical explanation. I contend that both art and morality possess an ineffable quality, a je ne sais quoi, that cannot be fully captured in a description of their attributes. Ethics, much like art, possess a transcendental nature. As Wittgenstein puts it, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics is transcendental.\" This ineffable essence, this indescribable something, is what imbues art and morality with their power, and it is this transcendental connection between them that I believe unites ethics and aesthetics. The shared experience of morality and art is particularly potent at a noumenal level, using a Kantian term, impacting us at a level that can be felt but not fully explained. The connection is especially profound in literature. As McKean observes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about it, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, such as music, but they seem as relevant to literature as they are to life itself.\" Living necessitates the engagement with values, and literature holds importance precisely because of the values we find within it.",
            "Germany, a nation of today, is a robust, unified territory that boasts a distinctive cultural tapestry, woven together from the alpine landscapes of Munich to the Baltic Sea shores of Kiel. This unique heritage can be felt in cities like Cologne along the Rhine, traversing the heart of Germany, and the Saxon city of Dresden situated by the Elbe River. The diversity of Germany's culture is not surprising as it arises from a blend of various sources and tribes.\n\nThe ancestral home of the Germans is Germania. The origins of the name are a subject of debate among scholars, with some attributing it to the Germanic tribe known historically as the Tungrians. Tacitus proposed that the Germans were so named due to their residence beyond the Rhine, engaging in frequent skirmishes with Gaulish forces. Alternatively, Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, used the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls under his control and those who remained unconquered. He derived this from the Gauls themselves, who employed it to differentiate their foes. Others suggest the name might come from the Old English word \"ger\" for their spear or the Old Irish word \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating their formidable nature.\n\nTacitus, in his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" from AD 98, recorded that the Germans were considered autochthonous, having migrated by sea rather than land. He pondered why anyone would choose to live in the wild, harsh climate of Germania over more hospitable lands like Italy or Rome. Similarly, the Romans, while they occasionally ventured into Germania for resources and conquests, primarily returned to their empire, leaving the Germanic tribes to thrive on the borders.",
            "Gazing down at the tableau before me, my mind was as vacant as a blank canvas. Indifferently, without a hint of emotion, I scrutinized the scene, my analytical faculties at work, yet they remained detached from any cognitive comprehension. Ideas flitted in and out of my consciousness with such swiftness that it seemed I was merely experiencing an endless stream of external stimuli. The calm efficiency of my perception made me question if I even possessed thoughts of my own. Once, a colleague suggested that I acquire \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\" to enhance my artistic abilities. Ever since I was a child, I had been captivated by the idea of drawing, and this book offered insights into the brain's interpretation of lines and shapes. It introduced a technique of framing any subject of study within a square, transforming complex scenes into simpler, more manageable images. Standing there, overwhelmed by the intricate arrangement of a bowl of fruit on a table, I was unable to mentally impose such a frame. The awestruck wonder that filled me was akin to the initial stirrings of the artist's journey, the genesis of my own artistic odyssey, \"Brown's Genesis.\" My fingers touched the chosen tool of my art, and my muscles tensed and released in rhythm with my hand's motion through space, each stroke a testament to my will. Water swirled serenely, crystal clear and unblemished. Matter detached itself, floating away like embers from a dying flame. My hand, anxious and hurried in its second attempt, struck the toilet handle, but the offending package remained stubbornly in place, a slug-like obstruction. Mop in hand, feet firmly planted, a green tie uncomfortably encircling my neck, I scrutinized the offensive deposit. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet introspection, then my hand reached for the toilet paper roll, wrapping itself in layers until it resembled a thick, misshapen mop. Straightening up, bending at the waist, my hand lowered into the bowl, mirroring the actions of a cook preparing a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming trend of teenage fatalities on the road is a complex tapestry of contributing factors. The National Institutes of Health highlight that the teen brain's immaturity is a significant factor in this predicament. Inexperience, the cornerstone of teenage driving, exacerbates the issue, leading to a surge in fatal accidents, vehicle rollovers, excessive speeding, and road deviations. Peer influence further amplifies the danger, as teenagers frequently drive with their peers, as any sensible individual would know. The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center's study corroborates this, revealing a direct correlation between the passengers' age and the frequency of traffic incidents.\n\nCalifornia and other states have implemented provisional licenses to mitigate these risks, restricting driving hours and prohibiting other minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely patchwork solutions. The core problem lies in the fact that, collectively, teenagers are statistically unprepared to handle the risks and responsibilities of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman advocates for delaying driving age beyond 18 to allow the propensity for thrill-seeking to subside. By 2010, a new wave of teenage drivers, the 'Boomers' offspring, will hit the road, potentially escalating the fatality toll.\n\nA feasible legislative approach could see schools continue teaching driver's education to lay the foundation for future drivers, but no one under 18 should be allowed to drive. Provisional permits would still be issued upon certain conditions, including practical training hours. The specific number could mirror current state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of adult-supervised practice. A national uniform policy could effectively protect teenagers nationwide, as these fatalities transcend state boundaries.\n\nThe proposed legislation is far from innovative.",
            "While navigating the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I stumbled upon a trove of fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films largely exploit creative editing to create illusions. My analysis primarily revolved around outlining the poetic elements present in the majority of these trick films and examining the unique characteristics of a few later ones. The trick films of the late 19th century are predominantly set-bound, constrained within a static frontal proscenium, with no camera movement, and employing long and medium shots, adhering to the rigid rule of one shot equaling one film. However, a select few films from the early 20th century dare to diverge from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA striking commonality among these trick films is their filming within an interior set, framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remains steadfast in its position, adhering to a static viewpoint. This style draws upon theatrical and vaudeville traditions. One notable example is Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors move horizontally across the frame, never approaching or receding from the camera.\n\nThis static composition often results in long and, less frequently, medium shots, with close-ups being entirely absent. This echoes the theatrical and vaudeville convention, where the audience witnessed the entire performance simultaneously within the stage's borders. Actors typically remain in the middle ground, eschewing close-ups.\n\nMost early trick films follow the rule that one conceptual shot equates to a single film, limiting their length to around a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This constraint also restricts their dramatic potential, favoring brief vaudeville-style tricks like magic and switching acts over complex narratives. However, a closer examination reveals that a single conceptual shot in the viewer's eyes may actually comprise multiple physical shots, joined to create illusions. Consider The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film. A careful viewing reveals that the 'head' shot with Mary's severed \"head\" begins midway through, though the film is perceived as one continuous shot.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, emerged as a passionate advocate for Republican principles in his era. While primarily an agriculturalist, his agricultural pursuits, combined with his brief political career, marked him as a man steadfast in his views on individual liberties and governance. His agrarian background deeply influenced his stances on sovereignty, the constitution, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor believed America's fledgling nationhood presented a unique chance to craft an ideal governance model, unhindered by native traditions. He strongly upheld the natural rights of individuals, asserting that these rights are interconnected; the denial of one compromises the value of all. These rights, he argued, should transcend the grasp of the government. He posited that in a state of nature, the physically strong and cunning benefited, but in civilization, this should not be the norm.\n\nTo achieve this utopian society, Taylor envisioned a government acknowledging the inherent good and evil in humanity. He advocated for a dualistic morality, asserting, \"As government is administered by man, its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He deemed good principles those that safeguard private property, advance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. A government founded on such principles would operate justly despite its leaders' leadership, who, he believed, would inevitably be driven by avarice and self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many Republicans of his time, championed strict constitutional interpretation. He advocated for a minimal Federal government, limited to the rights explicitly stated in the Constitution, citing the high cost and potential despotism of an extensive one. However, he cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation that could become corrupt without reference to the founders' intent. He considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defined the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, a significant downturn in commuter log submissions occurred during the third month of the project, which was somewhat disconcerting. The onset of winter in New England likely contributed, as fewer people commuted by bicycle or foot. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a period of intense academic activity, and the holiday season, which could have led students and faculty to overlook the commuter log. The project faced the hurdle of sustaining momentum amidst seasonal breaks and the intrinsic appeal of driving. To address this, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March to rekindle enthusiasm, which indeed spurred an increase in log submissions. Another obstacle was the ingrained preference for driving, necessitating robust incentives. We offered gift certificates to local businesses and even considered more substantial prizes like bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, potentially boosting engagement. Altering prize value over time might have further bolstered participation. Initially, gift cards sufficed, but escalating the prize offerings could have mitigated the project's engagement decline.",
            "An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument that mirrors the performance of an index, a commodity, or a collection of assets, much like an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on an exchange like stocks. ETFs offer the diversification of index funds and the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and purchasing as few as one share per transaction. However, ETFs are typically associated with lower expense ratios compared to average mutual funds. Nevertheless, they come with trade-offs, including commission fees for every transaction, akin to stock purchases. One of the standout features of ETFs is the wide range of available options.\n\nDespite the explicit benefits, it's prudent for a seasoned investor to scrutinize these advantages, particularly diversification, to ascertain their validity and degree. Here, we will assess the ETF IHF by comparing it to its top ten holdings, which account for 63.58% of all assets. Below are the top ten holdings and their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge how these top ten stocks reflect the entire ETF IHF, we will normalize the current percentage of assets to 100% and calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolio's Beta and return, assuming the portfolio consists solely of these ten stocks in the proportions dictated by the ETF's holdings. The results are as follows:\n\nIt's clear from the chart that a portfolio composed of just the top ten holdings yields a 6.11% higher return than the ETF as a whole, representing a 16% increase. Additionally, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 points lower than the ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio of the top ten holdings might offer higher returns with a lower risk. However, it is essential to conduct further analysis to determine if these two portfolios exhibit statistically significant differences.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical differences, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize these values to 100% to compare their accumulated standard deviation with that of the ETF IHF.",
            "\"Dream-land\" is one of Edgar Allan Poe's self-claimed superior poems. Here, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used this term in reference to an island north of Britain, a vestige of the ancient world's edge. While Virgil indeed used this term, there's a more contemporary influence to consider. Poe, with his keen interest in German literature, likely drew inspiration from Goethe.\n\nThis connection is significant as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarities between their poems, concluding that Poe may have been drawing upon Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the second part lies \"The King of Thulé,\" a poem about a king who, after his wife's death, drinks heavily and eventually takes his own life. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both works depicting a king haunted by loss and grief.\n\nPoe references \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and uses \"Thulé\" as bookends in \"Dream-Land.\" These two poems can be seen as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes Thule as a dark, lonely landscape, haunted by the specters of deceased friends, and devoid of color. This description resonates with \"The King of Thule,\" where the king, bereft of his wife, is consumed by loneliness and despair. It's as if the speaker of \"Dream-Land\" has stepped into Goethe's poem. Poe would have known of Goethe's work through Tennyson, whom he admired, or through the numerous reproductions that circulated after the original publication.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a patron injured by falling in a grocery store due to an applesauce spill be awarded punitive damages if the store manager, informed twice of the hazard, did not clean it within a half-hour because he was dining?\n\nGiven the circumstances, a judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's case for punitive damages. For such damages to be justified, evidence must be presented that the defendant's actions were deliberate and exhibited a disregard for potential harm, as well as demonstrating that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that Martin should have known the risk involved in not cleaning the spill, as multiple incidents of injury had occurred previously. However, while her argument that Martin's actions were outrageous may not be entirely compelling, it is still reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and his failure to address them.\n\nOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 PM, an employee at D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, notified his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill. Martin replied that he was on a dinner break and couldn't handle the issue. At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the spill, with Martin responding similarly. At 5:30 PM, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell, sustaining a severe back injury. Before this incident, five slip-and-fall reports had been filed at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a partial summary against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual wrongs if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intending to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard for others' safety. Id. at § 3294(c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when it involves a conscious disregard of the probable consequences, demonstrating that the defendant \"willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Four years ago, I enrolled in a course on Islam at CBC. The class centered on a contentious debate: the question of whether Islam is inherently hostile. This query seems as pertinent today as ever. Post-9/11, the U.S. media's stance on Islam and extremism has evolved dramatically, shifting from hostility to an unprecedented level of tolerance. In 2001, a presidential candidate named Barack Obama, with a Muslim lineage, was unthinkable. The Prophet Muhammad's biography captivates me, yet it presents a discrepancy with his character. The historical Muhammad appeared coercive, forcefully converting tribes and imposing Islam. In contrast, his biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly attracting converts one by one. I find parallels between Jesus' ministry and Muhammad's 'miracles,' such as multiplying mutton and milk for forty men. This narrative style diminishes Jesus' miracle and life, attributing his qualities to Muhammad. Moreover, many stories in the biography appear to serve as testimonials of voluntary conversions, but often relayed through third-hand accounts, which weakens their credibility. Most disturbingly, the work elevates Muhammad as a paragon of godliness, humility, wisdom, and gentleness, yet historical records contradict this portrayal, raising questions about the true nature of his rise to power.",
            "The tenets espoused by Jesus during his life were quickly eclipsed in the course of Christian thought's evolution post-mortem. Examining this trajectory on a grand scale, there's a discernible drift away from the religion's origins. The modern world, however, exhibits a burgeoning consciousness and an unparalleled progressive spirit. Meanwhile, traditionalists, steadfast in their beliefs, may not be numerous enough to sway the collective tide. Among Christians, historical comprehension is poised to expand significantly in the coming years. This understanding will fuel a yearning to disentangle the doctrines that have been interwoven into Christianity over time from the true spirit of its founder. This process, though gradual, is inevitable: a return to Christianity's original form. A movement will emerge, stripping away layers of doctrine, akin to rewinding time, until only the essence of what Jesus brought to humanity remains. When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing multitudes to worship as if living in Jesus' time, the church will remain steadfast as a guiding force. However, the theological pendulum will have swung back, resulting in a reduction of diversity and an increase in uniformity of belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and factional differences will give way to similarities. History is replete with such reversions. For instance, Christians were once persecuted by the Roman Empire, only to see that empire later become Christian. Our country has transitioned from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The imminent reversion in Christianity will similarly revert history, seeking the source and undoing diversity in the process. This transformation will be hastened by an interpretative shift, viewing Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal. Thus, what has transpired since Jesus' lifetime?\n\nTraversing history, we find only Judaism, the foundational theology for Christianity. At Jerusalem's Roman takeover in 63 B.C.E., monotheism, divine revelation, and Hebrew scripture authority were at the core. Jewish society was divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority common folk.",
            "I contend that The Jungle posits an inherent selfishness within humanity, where individuals prioritize their own advancement over the welfare of others. This is vividly illustrated by the factory owners and managers who strive to expand their enterprises with no regard for those who suffer in their wake. Their insatiable ambition is portrayed by Upton Sinclair, who depicts the factories as \"great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". The owners' apathy towards pollution and the well-being of the community is evident in their disregard for the pollution and waste generated by their operations. Furthermore, they prioritize profits over worker welfare, exploiting their employees with grueling work schedules and sudden layoffs, often leaving them without compensation or assistance in finding alternative employment. During the time The Jungle was set, there was a dearth of laws protecting workers' safety or well-being, enabling managers and owners to subjugate their workforce to subpar conditions. The workers in Packingtown were effectively trapped in this system, with no recourse for improvement or escape. The book subtly suggests that these workers were akin to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\". Hence, the narrative underscores the exploitation and suffering of the working class at the hands of unscrupulous employers.",
            "In literary works, authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific sentiments or attitudes towards significant themes. Among these, F. Scott Fitzgerald deploys various techniques in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, Fitzgerald couples adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to create a certain ambiance around a subject. Furthermore, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently utilizes them to achieve similar ends. In \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald invests colors with significance, notably white/gray and red/pink, and employs these meanings later to evoke specific feelings associated with important objects.\n\nWhite/gray, for instance, is associated with uniformity, where white signifies elegance and higher social standing, while gray denotes age and weariness. Fitzgerald establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are often depicted in white—even Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby’s party, while Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is \"powdered milky white\" (30). The only exception is when Nick describes Gatsby’s party, where the halls are adorned with vibrant primary colors, standing in stark contrast to the uniformity of white.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces this meaning by applying white/gray to ordinary subjects. Nick's journey to work is described as descending through \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), while the names on his timetable become \"gray names\" (61). Additionally, he colors mundane people and places with these hues: Daisy and Jordan shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child on the railroad (26), and the dog-seller is a \"gray old man\" (27).\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he employs white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy, who, after a prolonged absence of significant color use, is suddenly described as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster.\" This portrayal diminishes Daisy's character, depicting her as a mere uniform addition—an object of Gatsby's longing. Fitzgerald continues this technique, emphasizing Daisy’s uniformity with a \"gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar\" (18) and her wearing a white dress (115) before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County, renowned for its yielding agricultural landscape, thrives under a serene, sun-filled climate. The terrain is fertile with a variety of crops such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The area harbors a robust demand for organic, community-supported agriculture, with many local groups boasting extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk, too, are highly sought after. Numerous organic farms invite visitors to observe their operations, offering hiking trails and birdwatching opportunities.\n\nThis type of farm operation can be advantageous for the landowner, as they can benefit from government initiatives while enhancing habitat and facilitating recreational activities, such as farm tours and educational programs. Organic farming, while beneficial for biodiversity in plants and wildlife, presents greater expenses compared to conventional farming. It demands more intensive labor and management to handle pests and weeds without chemicals, and yields can be less consistent. Additionally, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nThe chosen land, adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, measures 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland near the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. Historically, this area has been inhabited by Native Americans before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This parcel was part of an original homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production.",
            "The role of culture in any negotiation is multifaceted and profound. Culture, often defined as much by what it isn't as what it is, is a complex and varied entity that isn't uniform or singular. It is not accurate to generalize about entire nations or groups, such as suggesting \"all Russians are tough\" or \"all Japanese are cooperative.\" While understanding broad cultural traits is beneficial, a negotiator should focus on the specific cultural elements relevant to the negotiation at hand, and how these elements may influence the dialogue and interactions. When encountering a foreign culture, one tends to relate it to their own, and comparisons are inevitable.\n\nDelving into a foreign culture or mindset can involve a range of activities from studying its background to recognizing its biases. Rather than evaluating or attempting to alter a culture, one must acknowledge it and operate within its confines, especially when at a negotiation table with a weaker bargaining stance. Respect for local traditions and beliefs can facilitate overcoming cultural hurdles and propel the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is crucial to remember that culture isn't confined to national or international boundaries. Many enterprises within a single country develop their unique corporate cultures, which can vary drastically. For example, some companies prioritize long office hours, while others promote a more laid-back schedule. Indicators of corporate culture can be seen in employee attire, communication styles (ranging from direct to indirect), and hiring practices. Some businesses encourage employee philanthropy, while others limit it to approved initiatives. Even within the United States, corporate cultures can differ significantly, with variations existing not only between companies but also within a single organization, depending on location, whether urban or suburban. Some cultures appear less stratified, but this uniformity can be deceiving; it may be an indication to explore further.\n\nValues are particularly significant to understand, as they provide the rationale behind a culture. If a culture values maintaining harmony or saving face, a negotiator will not publicly embarrass their company or superior to secure a deal. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture that prioritizes intense bargaining may not settle quickly. Being aware of these cultural tendencies before negotiation is crucial, but it's also beneficial to learn about the individual opponent to make the negotiation more effective.",
            "The quotation, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" can be found at the beginning of Psalm 14 in the Christian Bible, and was also utilized by St. Anselm in his discourse on the existence of God. This belief appears to be shared by another influential thinker, Thomas Aquinas. To fairly assess which of these arguments is more persuasive, let us initially presume that both are correct in their belief in the existence of the God of the Bible. Adopting a different concept of a divine entity would complicate the comparison, as both arguments are centered around a specific divine being. However, neither argument offers a comprehensive foundation for believing in this particular deity.\n\nFirst, let us delve into the core argument of St. Anselm. His approach emphasizes introspection, suggesting that understanding God is found within one's own thoughts and understanding. He posits that God's existence is so inherently clear that it cannot be denied, as it is ingrained in our minds. This notion, while somewhat oblique, essentially argues that the proof for God lies within us, and no external evidence is required. This perspective is often referred to as faith within Christian tradition.\n\nThomas Aquinas, on the other hand, advocates for a more rational approach. He contends that God's existence can be logically proven through empirical and rational means, without the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous in Christianity's mission of converting new adherents, as it relies solely on logical reasoning rather than the acceptance of unprovable ideas. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments to support his case, each demonstrating that the need for God is logically necessary. If one piece of a puzzle is missing, and the rest fit perfectly, logic dictates the existence of the missing piece, even without seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, during the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future sage, later known as the Buddha, emerged. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, resulting in the inception of Buddhism. This faith, with its most traditional branch known as Theravada, is approximately 2500 years old and has transformed significantly over time. For example, in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, the ritual of the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, involving both monks and laypeople, despite the Buddha's teachings lacking any mention of such a celebration. These changes permeate the religion, from surface-level customs to its core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from the monastery or the laity, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both internal and external, friendly and unfriendly factors.\n\nSeveral key terms will be frequently used in this discourse. Internal forces refer to influences from fellow Buddhists, regardless of their monastic status. External forces are those from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community due to negative perceptions. Benign forces are those that do not wish to harm or aid the community, but may incidentally do so. These terms will recur throughout this discussion.\n\nTo begin, the fundamental elements of the religion—the core doctrines of Theravada Buddhism—should be examined. Buddhists find solace in the Triple Gem consisting of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is primarily composed of the Tripitaka, or three baskets, of Buddhist scripture. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the monastic rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka covers the metaphysical aspects. Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Recognition of these principles is necessary to liberate oneself from Sansara, the cycle of rebirth, and to eliminate lobha (desire), dosa (hate), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for life, with five precepts for laypeople (I will not kill, I will not lie, I will not steal, I will not engage in inappropriate sexual conduct, and I will not use intoxicants) and numerous rules for monks. The four noble truths form the most fundamental doctrinal concept. The first truth is that life is filled with suffering. The second is that attachment causes suffering. The third truth is that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico's relationship has been marked by a protracted rivalry extending over five and a half decades, from 1836 until 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The zenith of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), during which the United States vanquished Mexico and acquired Texas and the southwestern territories. Throughout this period, numerous skirmishes occurred between the two nations, with tensions easing only in the aftermath of World War I. The roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental differences such as religion, culture, tradition, and material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dynamic is not unique to the United States and Mexico; neighboring nations often experience similar rivalries. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find enduring, overarching American diplomatic challenges\" (p. 41). These nations, geographically proximate to the United States, have historically been rivals, whereas other Latin American countries have enjoyed more harmonious relations. Religious tensions, a recurrent theme in international relations, played a significant role in this rivalry. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86), much like the ideological struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, where the conflict was part political and part a battle over key interests. These tensions were exacerbated by the enduring mistrust between the English and Spanish, inherited from their colonial past. This mutual mistrust was a formidable obstacle to the development of cordial diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document seventeen disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period, the majority of which were territorial in nature. Issues such as border raids by outlaws and bandits from American towns into Mexican territory remained a persistent problem until both nations imposed military control over their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). The rivalry began to abate as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States economically (Schmitt, 1974, p. 109). This dependence, coupled with a shift in American ambition from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (Schmitt, 1974, p. 110), marked the end of the rivalry in the late 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen and crippling ailment struck me down abruptly, a condition I had been wholly unaware of. At that time, I was employed as a nurse, a profession I had chosen to ensure the security and stability I had known as a child. \"You'll always find work; people will always fall ill,\" I heard repeatedly as I grew older. Thus, I opted for nursing over my dreams of becoming a scientist or a journalist, a blend of both. Yet, here I was at 46, unmarried, penniless, and unable to work. My disability persists to this day, and after 15 years of Social Security Disability payments, I possess nothing that is truly mine. The daily struggle has eroded my sense of security, safety, and self-worth, leaving me with no certainties in life. Still, I am convinced that I would not have endured these years without my family's and a few friends' support, as strong as I was. In truth, when calamity strikes, strength fades quickly.\n\nI believe that emergencies, big or small, are a constant in life. Despite thorough planning, some crises are insurmountable alone. I concur that we should not place all our faith in the crumbling government structure. However, I advocate that Americans learn to trust and support one another again, rather than each individual hoarding resources like a lone survivor.\n\nThe notion of rugged individualism, often championed by the American right, is a myth. Our forefathers' resilience in hard times stemmed from empathy, mutual respect, and resource sharing, not isolation. The pioneers who journeyed across the Rockies did not reach the coast alone. They relied on community and cooperation.\n\nWhile I advocate preparedness—disaster kits, first aid supplies, water purification tablets, and so on—I also urge you to foster relationships with your neighbors. Let us rebuild our communities and aid one another, for that is how we shall weather storms.",
            "The query of why organisms evolve in specific ways and the constraints that guide this evolution has been a perplexing one since D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 assertion that even the simplest organic forms remain undefined in mathematical terms. However, recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to various biological phenomena, including the development of mollusk shells through both their growth and evolutionary history. Our investigation aims to merge mathematical models of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum species with experimental data to uncover the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary changes. By analyzing X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model potential and actual shell morphologies in software like CerioShell. These results are then harmonized with experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell is essentially a three-dimensional structure that evolves along a 360-degree path in space over time. These loops or turns in the shell are called whorls, which spiral around a central imaginary axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line, referred to as a suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the final one, called the body whorl. The spire comprises all whorls except the last, with the apex being the spire's tip and the opposite end called the base. The aperture is the opening through which the animal emerges from the shell.\n\nShells can be examined from various angles: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The typical view is an apertural one, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the start of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, approximating to a quarter whorl where necessary.\n\nShells can also be perceived as a sequence of apertures that traverse through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The trajectory of the aperture can be visually and mathematically tracked using coordinates of the aperture centers and the horizontal and vertical radii. Once mathematically formulated, these parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia have remained largely unchanged. Although the country is making strides towards achieving several Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets, it's falling significantly short in improving child and maternal health indicators to meet 2015 goals. Multiple factors underlie these shortcomings, suggesting a need to bolster Indonesia's overall healthcare system rather than solely relying on specific program interventions.\n\nIndonesia has shown progress in the number of births attended by skilled workers, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional practitioners like midwives, who cannot handle medical interventions in complicated pregnancies. Thus, maternal deaths from hemorrhage remain high, indicating there's still much ground to cover. Additionally, there's been a decrease in the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea. Postnatal care data is incomplete but reveals low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than anticipated, at approximately 4%. This disparity is more pronounced in rural areas, where rates drop to 2%. This disparity highlights inequities in healthcare access, with urban areas receiving more attention. There's also a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, suggesting the poor face significant challenges affording healthcare.\n\nWhen considering improvements to neonatal and maternal care, the primary question is how to best address the lack of adequate services. Should Indonesia focus on targeted program-specific approaches or build up its overall healthcare system? Vertical, targeted approaches offer defined, manageable goals and faster results. However, they can lead to uneven funding distribution and human resource allocation, as seen in HIV/AIDS and family planning sectors. Moreover, they can result in duplicated, uncoordinated services, increasing paperwork and administrative burdens.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the elite society of the era. Two works that diverge from this standard are 'Oliver Twist' and 'Wuthering Heights'. Both employ an element of intrigue and eccentricity, uncommon in their contemporaries, which deepens the characters' profiles and provides insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist is engulfed by the cacophony of sounds and lights, he is suddenly overwhelmed by a vivid recollection of his past experiences, seemingly trapped in a constant state of confusion and disorientation. The passage delves into his inner turmoil, depicting a sense of helplessness and desperation as he is unable to exert control over his circumstances. The shooting sequence, revisited in chapter 28, is a stark reminder of his vulnerability and the lack of agency he possesses over his life. As he relives the traumatic event, he is once again engulfed by despair, reflecting the growing influence of Fagin over him. This sequence underscores the notion that Oliver is powerless to alter his fate, reinforcing his sense of defeat as he is forced to accept his circumstances.\n\nThe temporal distortion in the passage is evocative, depicting a cycle of day and night that seems to blur together, suggesting an unending loop of suffering. The relentless repetition of the day and night sequence mirrors the repetitive nature of Oliver's existence, highlighting his trapped and desolate state.",
            "Several years back, I was involved in an after-school program aimed at tutoring elementary-aged students. My forte was English and reading, but I did my best to assist them in any subject they struggled with. A colleague approached me to help a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading. Initially, his issues seemed unusual as he could pronounce some letters correctly while others were entirely off the mark. He was of Latino descent and spoke fluent English, yet his reading comprehension was problematic. A significant breakthrough occurred when I met his mother. She entered the building while I was temporarily supervising a few children remaining after a field trip. Despite speaking only Spanish, we managed to communicate thanks to my limited Spanish skills. It then became clear that Adrian was not having trouble reading but rather with recognizing the English alphabet.\n\nI share this anecdote to emphasize the challenges posed by language barriers in educational settings, particularly in California. Even though Adrian spoke perfect English, he faced significant hurdles in reading due to his unfamiliarity with the English alphabet. This highlights that reading difficulties can be more complex than they initially appear.\n\nTo address this issue, a multi-faceted approach is crucial. For instance, the dual language system offers numerous benefits, not only for Spanish-speaking children but for all students. Research has shown that children in these programs outperform their peers academically. Yet, fears persist that such programs waste resources and do not benefit the majority of students. However, implementing these programs as the standard could provide advantages to all. To achieve this, we don't need all teachers to be bilingual. Instead, we can employ bilingual aids or tutors to support the students.",
            "Since our earliest memories, many of us are imbued with the notion of something greater than our individual selves, something that transcends our ability to grasp fully. Some are catechized in Sunday school, while others engage in religious rituals or introspection. Inheriting beliefs from our predecessors is common, yet some cast off these traditions, asserting their singular worldview. Our journeys to construct our spiritual identities are as varied as the paths we tread. We seek guidance to navigate the darkness and emerge into the light.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father replied to my query about his favorite bird. We sat on our front porch, the rain's rhythmic patter on the tin roof echoing our quiet conversation as we shared cigarettes. The gutters channeled the rain, quenching the thirsty plants along the porch edge. His gaze, a mix of curiosity and reminiscence, shifted between the downpour and the distant horizon. His once robust figure had grown gaunt; his once thick hair had thinned. His avoidance of my gaze was palpable, a chasm between us. I felt isolated, anxious, and unable to express my fears to him. Instead, I moved closer, wrapping him in a silent embrace, our shared silence punctuated only by the symphony of the rain.\n\nFather passed in December, days after my twenty-second birthday. The extended survival, facilitated by chemotherapy and radiation, bought time, yet it only prolonged his suffering. The worth of this time was elusive to me. If a divine entity existed, I thought, it had abandoned me. In the stillness of the night, I refrained from prayer. If God listened, it was not to me.\n\nI chose not to witness his transition. The thought of observing the creator of my life was too much to bear. I yearned to recall him through the prism of his life, not his passing. I retreated into a cocoon of solitude, curling up in my bed for three days, awaiting news that never came. The silence was deafening, echoing the emptiness I felt.",
            "The quintessential \"Gothic Novel,\" as \"Old-New\" as described by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has been alternately dismissed and celebrated, labeled as lacking depth while simultaneously praised for its 'terrible sublime' quality (Burke). At its inception, the \"Gothic Novel\" drew from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to birth a new literary form, as exemplified by Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto. Walpole merged \"old\" theatrical elements with 'new' naturalistic mimicry in his portrayal of \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, rooted in medieval theatre, architecture, and traditions, paradoxically became associated with outdated or primitive sensibilities despite the 'modern' advancements it represented. This fusion of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's personal character psychology ensured its enduring appeal, rendering it both obsolete and fresh to readers separated by time from its original inception.\n\nOne persistent theme in Gothic literature is the idealization of chivalry, a concept rooted in medieval knight training. The Gothic novel, particularly The Castle of Otranto, retained and transformed this medieval notion. Chivalry's appeal to Gothic writers lay in its embodiment of the brave, honorable, and competent knight, a stark contrast to their perception of contemporary society's lack of these qualities. By incorporating chivalric elements, the \"gothic past\" was romanticized and used as a critique and aspiration for the present. Walpole, writing in a politically fraught era, may have felt that the supposed moral goodness of the Gothic age had been lost in his contemporaries. This is evident in his character, Frederic, who exemplifies chivalric traits before ever meeting him. Described as a prince, one who has endured tragedy, and a presumed victim of infidels, Frederic embodies the soon-to-be iconic trope of Gothic excess.",
            "The flow of logistics, from initial procurement of raw materials through to delivery to the end-user, constitutes a supply chain's operations. This concept, coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, involves the strategic oversight and management of this sequence to fulfill customer needs rapidly and effectively. The supply chain comprises six critical facets: production, procurement, inventory, location, transport, and data exchange. Business leaders harness these components to deliver superior customer service.\n\nProduction is the cornerstone of the supply chain process. It sets the foundation for all subsequent stages. Production planning involves determining when, why, where, and how products will be made. Understanding customer preferences is paramount for effective production. Market analysis provides valuable insights into consumer demand. Once demand is understood, decisions on product types and quantities to produce can be made. Location selection for production is crucial, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Production scheduling and equipment maintenance follow, ensuring efficiency and minimizing long-term costs. Consistent procedural guidelines, like those employed by Wal-Mart and Target, promote smooth operations and clear expectations.\n\nThe second essential aspect of supply chain management is procurement. Procurement strategies aim to establish a facility's core capabilities and foster strategic partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with distinct equipment, workers, and specialties. Managers must decide which division suits various manufacturing processes best. Outsourcing to external partners can enhance flexibility and reduce costs without compromising quality, thereby accelerating the supply chain.",
            "A mysterious sign reads, \"Hitler Survives in Burmese Territory.\" Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, stands alone on a bustling city street, a hastily made cardboard sign held aloft. The sign bears a chilling message, written in bold, black lettering. Burma, or Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military regime, which seized power in 1962 through a coup d'état. In 2007, public protests, led by Buddhist monks, erupted, marking the first demonstrations after a decade of silence. These peaceful gatherings, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" for the monks' robes, attracted widespread attention. Initially, the government allowed the monks to gather, but violence escalated, with monasteries raided, foreign journalists imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, killed.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have suppressed dissent and asserted complete control over their citizens. Roman emperors claimed divine right, Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, and even our current leader, George W. Bush, has reportedly conferred with Ted Haggard, leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a division of the Republican Party.\n\nNotable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where intellectuals, activists, and students were met with a violent crackdown by the Chinese government. The death toll varies greatly, from 200 to 3,000. Another tragic example is the 1994 Rwandan genocide, where Hutu militia, aided by the government, systematically killed Tutsis and political moderates. And who could forget the horrors of Hitler's Third Reich, a period of mass killings targeting Jewish individuals across Europe.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz is largely due to his sustained career and his ability to mold his orchestra. His piano presence, though often subtle, is eclipsed by his prowess as a composer. Ellington excelled in crafting intricate pieces that spotlighted individual musicians' talents, providing structured frameworks for solos and integrating unique musical ideas. He prioritized ensemble cohesion and the distinctive tones of each member, resulting in groundbreaking and brilliant compositions. The Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as an instrument, demonstrated in \"Creole Love Call,\" where he employed vocal textures and colors without lyrics. This piece showcases his knack for complementing soloists, a skill evident throughout his career. \"Creole Love Call\" features six choruses, each characterized by distinct call-and-response dynamics and solo instruments. Ellington's use of voice as a solo instrument, as seen in the growl technique, adds depth to his work. In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington showcases his orchestration skills and keen ear for tone color. A call-and-response between \"Bubber\" Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing harmonizes vocal elements of Miley's playing with instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. Similarly, in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" Ellington masterfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on a muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she harbored an insatiable longing, a void that refused to be satiated. At fourteen, it began, and though three years had passed, it remained, now a yearning for connection rather than a thing. Boys her peers found intriguing, but none piqued her interest. She pondered this perplexing conundrum often, her curiosity unabated. Her life was typically uneventful, her parents a pair of serene individuals, their disagreements rare and confined to her assertions of independence. Yet, today was different.\n\nAs she traversed the house, searching for inspiration, a piercing scream echoed from the kitchen. Her heart pounded as she rushed in, desperation etched on her face. \"Mom? Mom, what's wrong?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, moaning softly. She knelt beside her, concern etched on her face. \"Mom, can you tell me where to take you?\" Her mother, her voice strained, directed her to the car. With her mother's instructions, she hoisted her into the back seat, climbing behind the wheel. The hospital, a sterile and foreboding place, was her destination.\n\nThe doctor's verdict revealed her mother had fallen from a stool while attempting to reach a high shelf.",
            "This investigation aimed to demonstrate the link between adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), represented by a high \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", and a decreased risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related mortality. The aMed diet is essentially a tweaked version of the Med diet, emphasizing higher intake of plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, swapping monounsaturated fats for saturated fats and including fish, while lowering consumption of animal products and saturated fats, with moderate alcohol intake permitted. Prior research has shown an inverse correlation between following a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and a clinical trial revealed the Med diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, previous studies did not concentrate on stroke or stroke-related mortality.\n\nThis longitudinal study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, free of CVD or diabetes, who are part of the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states. Six times over 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated an aMed diet score from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess yearly nutrient intake. More than 95% of nurses maintained participation over the 20-year period, with FFQs validated through studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Cases lacking records were considered \"probable\" and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Variables like body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone therapy use were assessed for each FFQ, with leisure-time physical activity added beginning in 1986.\n\nTo mitigate random variation for individuals and represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed, averaging scores from two prior years. Adjustments were made for potential confounding factors by accounting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between an aMed score and CHD and stroke risk, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 strokes, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In 2007, a severe financial catastrophe struck the United States. Joblessness surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous major American corporations were left in ruins. This recession continues today, prompting the question: what caused this crisis, and how can we prevent a recurrence? Essentially, the financial crisis was the result of shortsighted and self-serving political choices that coerced banks and firms into providing subprime loans within an inadequate and unready financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks were lacking sufficient capital reserves and transferred the ensuing tumult to the repacked mortgages they had sold, further contaminating the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis can be traced back to the Clinton administration's 1999 policies. Seeking a second term, the president relaxed lending restrictions to boost his popularity. This move set the stage for the subprime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage underwriter, felt increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals, while also facing stockholder demands to maintain its remarkable profit growth.” Holmes accurately predicted the repercussions of these actions: “Yet, the government-subsidized corporation may encounter difficulties in an economic downturn, requiring a government bailout similar to the one provided to the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As anticipated in the introduction, ill-considered lending practices ultimately precipitated the economic collapse.\n\nA multitude of factors conspired to plunge the economy into turmoil, one of them being the new and convoluted mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years preceding the crisis, entangling more sectors of the economy in the housing market. This overleveraging left U.S. households and financial markets highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in these mortgage-backed securities in a precarious position. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, representing about 30% of the U.S. GDP. Consequently, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a loss, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to convert into commercial banks under strict regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the introduction phase.  That section in your narrative where you spread your creative wings and captivate your audience with your enchanting, almost spellbinding composition.  Or perhaps it's the part where your readers nod off or hit the \"back\" button, swearing under their breath at the sheer dreariness of it all.  Dr. M. has been known to mutter unpleasantries at her screen when she encounters an excess of background details, and not the enjoyable kind.\n\nExposition is not your ally.\n\nMy dear readers are already aware of the fundamental writing guideline, \"Show, don't tell,\" yet Dr. M. still finds herself ensnared in lengthy stretches of prose where nothing occurs, or worse, an overload of information.  Exposition is that pesky whisper in your ear that persuades you to squeeze in the backstory to get to the juicier bits (not to be mistaken for the voice suggesting you reveal every intimate detail of your characters' pasts).\n\nExposition signifies relaying information to the audience, usually in straightforward language.  In film, it's when one character shares extensive knowledge with another, similar to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, you're the one doing the sharing.\n\nConsider this instance.  As you read a tale, you're informed that the heroine met her beloved at a specific location and time, wedded him in a grand ceremony, and her husband was killed in her presence.  You wouldn't anticipate this entire sequence to occupy two pages, during which they barely utter a word each.  You'd anticipate the author to dedicate time to fleshing out the husband's character, demonstrating through his speech and behavior the depth of his affection for his wife, and to equally illustrate the heroine's transformation and enhancement due to his presence (especially if the story later states it outright).  A proper introduction of the husband's character would foster empathy for his demise and give insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, the strength of their bond, reflections of her thoughts and beliefs and dreams through his lens, and so forth.  You'd mourn his loss with her, and thereby become more connected to her.\n\nIn essence, you should offer substance to the simple skeleton of the plot: \"They met, they wed, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance.  (*glances at metaphor, sighs, presses forward*)  Sometimes, the temptation is strong to hurry past certain elements.  Maybe you're introducing a new character and know he served in the military, now runs a gas station at night, was married twice, no children, enjoys weekend fishing, secretly yearns to own the station someday, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.",
            "I viewed two broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The initial one, aired live on August 13, 2011, was from NBC 4. The primary story was about an incident in Ashley, Ohio, involving a man named Shad Hostettler who stabbed his wife. The report was brief, lasting approximately two minutes, and provided minimal details. The second story was about an early morning shooting of a 18-year-old named Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. He was critically injured, and no arrests had been made. The story was brief, and I suspect this could be attributed to the involvement of a minority. I've observed a pattern where stories involving minorities are often given less attention. For instance, if a white child or adult is involved in a crime, the media coverage is extensive, but when it's a minority, it's fortunate if it gets any mention at all. Another story discussed a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter, believed to be caused by a .22 caliber rifle. A reward of five thousand dollars was offered for information leading to the shooter's arrest. The weather forecast mentioned rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon, with temperatures expected to remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. This story was short but served as a teaser to keep viewers tuned in. A story about a robbery at a Clime Road UDF store featured a dark-skinned black man as the suspect. The report emphasized his race and physical description, which seemed excessive. Another story mentioned a convicted Texas drug lord, Rene Rodriguez, known for distributing large quantities of marijuana from Texas to Ohio. Instead of saying he was sentenced to 25 years, they stated \"300\" months, which I found peculiar. They also highlighted his Hispanic background, which seemed unrelated to the story.",
            "A kinship between siblings, unyielding and constant, holds a myriad of feelings: affection, arrogance, envy, and harshness, among others. They comprehend one another deeply, more so than anyone else bound by such a tie, and when they gaze upon their brother, they glimpse their own soul. It's in the gravest of moments that this bond reveals its true essence, whether it be benign or malevolent. These sentiments, when exposed, exact a severe toll. Part of grappling with the feelings born of this fraternal connection is confronting their aftermath. When one peers into the eyes of a brother, they behold not their reflection as others may see it, but as they truly are. Their actions and the repercussions thereof unveil their genuine nature. In \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Traversing a vividly described terrain, these two boys embark on a doomed voyage. A clash of bitter disappointment and fierce pride unfolds in the culminating scene, and only one brother survives. This theme is conveyed through the direct portrayal of the protagonist, Doodle, and their exchanges, as well as the narrator's perspective, which elucidates the intricate emotions Doodle experiences and his view of the world around him, both of which significantly shape his behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions can be distilled to one overriding emotion: haughtiness. From their initial outings together to their final, calamitous trip, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could learn all of his expertise, such as holding his breath, running, jumping, or scaling the vines in Old Woman Swamp. He longed for a companion who could join him in races to Horsehead Landing and perch with him at the top of the great pine behind the barn. However, Doodle's frailty, a result of his weak heart, made these expectations unachievable. Doodle was not capable of participating in strenuous activities, much less surviving. The young protagonist's dreams were shattered, and he even contemplated killing Doodle by suffocating him with a pillow. But when the child smiled at him, his heart softened. This act of kindness, so simple yet powerful, offered the protagonist a glimmer of hope, suggesting that his initial intent may not have been deeply rooted. In the depths of his heart, he held an innate affection for his brother.",
            "The human brain, an intricate and imaginative data manipulator, has witnessed shifts in its metaphors as technology evolved from rudimentary to contemporary forms. It was initially likened to a wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, followed by a book, and finally, a computer. As one delves into the intricacies of the mind, it's crucial to recognize the limitations and potential pitfalls of these analogies.\nInformation journey begins with sensory organs, which convert external stimuli into electrical signals. This data is continually transformed by the brain's algorithms through dual pathways: bottom-up and top-down. For instance, perceiving a black box on a white background involves piecing together simple data like color, direction, and edges to determine the object's shape. Top-down processing aids in faster recognition by utilizing prior decisions to identify the object. For example, it helps distinguish a black box from a box-shaped void in the background.\nAfter initial processing, an attention gate sorts the relevance and accessibility of signals. While the brain processes every blade of grass upon gazing at one's shoes, a healthy attention gate filters out individual blades. Conversely, even in a noisy environment, one can pick out their name. Multiple processing stages repeat this attention modulation.\nData retention is crucial for the brain's operation. Memory types include sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies by stimuli type, such as structural, phonemic, or semantic. Information is maintained through various means, with working memory potentially sustained by brief electrical loops among neurons, and long-term memory potentially retained in specific protein structures.\nDiverse models propose differing ways to structure knowledge in the brain, drawing from human memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysics. The semantic network model posits that concepts are node-like entities connected based on their relationships. For example, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can further connect to \"wooden.\"",
            "Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" presents a prospective threat posed by both technology and capitalism, engendering a dystopian society where communal interests supersede individuality. Citizens are indoctrinated from birth to prioritize immediate gratification, serving as pawns in a grand scheme controlled by the World Controller. This dystopia, scrutinized through a Marxist lens, reveals Huxley's concerns about the burgeoning economic systems of his era. Key Marxist concepts like homogeneity and reification underscore the critique of economic flaws in Huxley's time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, which denies the common populace insight into their true economic relations, focusing instead on personal gain. This is orchestrated by the ideological subjugation of the working class, evident in the conditioning of Brave New World's citizens. While the lower classes, such as Deltas and Gammas, have no genuine will, they are driven to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one social class by another, is plainly illustrated here, with the lower classes unknowingly adhering to the capitalist and consumerist ideology. Upper classes, while capable of recognizing this, remain complacent, with few Alphas or Betas like Bernard asserting themselves. The interactions among social classes further highlight the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nIn Brave New World, genuine relationships between individuals are absent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, perhaps suggesting that technology and capitalism strip humans of their free will and expression. Love and emotional extremes are non-existent, with interactions maintained on a superficial level, exemplified by men discussing women's physical attributes and women's casual remarks about their encounters. The societal classes' acceptance of their hierarchical status indicates the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role in the community signifies the Marxist portrayal of the proletariat, who are falsely convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to their peers.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years, or four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be quite challenging for many, including myself. During my freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm, quite literally at the easternmost edge of campus. Getting to classes in the Willard building, situated near the central hub, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in inclement weather, which is a regular occurrence in State College. Engaging in conversation with a recent graduate, I discovered that the East Halls dorms used to be separated from the rest of the campus by vast stretches of unused land. Now, this space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings like the Creamery and health services center, and residential apartments. As the campus continues to grow, mobility becomes increasingly difficult. What is the most effective solution to this issue? For college students, it is undoubtedly the bicycle. However, merely having bicycles available is insufficient. Students must embrace cycling, and the campus infrastructure must be designed to accommodate cyclists.\n\nDiscussing this with a friend who recently restarted cycling after a hiatus, he remarked, \"Bikes are fantastic, especially for getting around campus.\" Unlike some trends, cycling remains the only practical means of transportation. Aside from its health benefits, it's also the most efficient method of travel. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a bit of physical effort can cover 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, just as far from the central area as some dorms. The most intelligent decision I've made this year was investing in a bicycle. My daily class in Thomas building takes about 25 minutes on foot from my house, but riding a bike can reduce this to just 5 minutes if I pedal quickly. The main drawback is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas from my home, isn't always the easiest road to traverse, whether by bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, my busy schedule makes it impractical. If I didn't have a bike, walking would be my sole reliable option for attending classes. Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my day, amounting to over two and a half hours each week. Factor in the time I'd spend walking to other classes, appointments, and various errands, and it's more time than I can spare."
