            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

These values are not merely professional aspirations; they are deeply personal convictions.\n\nMy path to this decision has been a winding one. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed numerous individuals grappling with their problems, often in unhealthy ways. This inspired me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a field I felt could equip me with the necessary tools to understand and help others. However, I remained uncertain about my career path after graduation. It was during a summer break, visiting a friend, that I encountered a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned that he had reported his situation to the police. Seeing an opportunity to assist, I offered my help, explaining my background to the officers. They requested my intervention, as they felt limited by their legal constraints. When I spoke to the parents, they seemed evasive, labeling their son's distress as a \"manipulative\" behavior. This experience solidified my desire to pursue a career in social work, where I could contribute more effectively to helping children navigate such complex family dynamics.\n\nSocial justice is another value that resonates deeply with me. While society often pays lip service to the importance of the individual, we are often encouraged to conform to societal norms. I choose to embrace my individuality and challenge these norms.

            "The following document delves into the Biological and Sociocultural paradigms concerning insomnia. Biological models concentrate on inherited genetic information and health-related aspects, while Sociocultural models explore environmental ties with race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models, explaining selected research to relate and elucidate them. The research explanations and findings are then critically evaluated for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary, secondary, or other categories. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias; secondary disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental disorders. Other sleep disorders can stem from medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia hinders adequate or continuous sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia makes staying awake difficult for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias pertain to behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Mental disorder-related sleep difficulties arise from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders, Mental Retardation). The following review centers on insomnia and also addresses primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, inheritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the human GABAB receptor. A disruption or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and alterations would naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life aspects that require focus and endurance.",
            "This document delves into the three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with an overview of the disorder, followed by a detailed explanation of its diagnosis, which includes common indicators or \"warning signs\". The paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in a mainstream classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. In essence, CAPD is a disorder wherein the brain's ability to process sounds, particularly separating words and discerning conversation from background noise, is impaired. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing but struggle due to their brain's inadequacy in interpreting auditory information.\n\n\tThe roots of CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, initially labeled \"auditory imperception\" by researchers investigating communicative disorders. An Italian research team, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, initiated diagnostic tests for these children in 1954. Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961 further advanced understanding of the disorder's physiological basis, while a 1977 conference sparked broader research on CAPD.\n\n\tSymptoms of CAPD include difficulty localizing or recognizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, and identifying sound patterns. Individuals may struggle to differentiate changes in speech, such as sarcasm, and may be affected by the order in which auditory information is presented. Additionally, their ability to synthesize sound clues meaningfully and act upon them might be compromised.\n\n\tDiagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, which can be administered by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. These tests may consist of questionnaires, auditory behavior observations, and advanced acoustic signal recordings. Despite efforts, no single test or cause for CAPD has been consistently identified.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night suggests that while masquerade can be a tool for deceit over extended periods, it ultimately requires shedding the disguise to prevent self-forgetfulness. Disclosing the truth, however, poses challenges such as potential estrangement. The decision then lies between self-preservation and the maintenance of relationships. While some may accept the ruse, others may be offended.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender reversal, particularly Viola's case, raises significant concerns, namely the motive behind one's assumption of an opposite gender identity. Viola, a newcomer in a strange land, adopts a male guise for protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Her scheme succeeds but distances her from female companions, denying her important support. Moreover, her convincing portrayal leads Olivia to confuse her with her twin brother Sebastian, resulting in romantic entanglements: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, she faces suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nViewed through a modern lens, this might be seen as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires invoked by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario due to his male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? One might argue Olivia's behavior suggests she is merely reflecting the societal judgments of her time. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The sharp criticisms aimed at German colonial rule, especially its harsh treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa, are well-documented. Yet, reducing the colonial enterprise to such stark terms would disregard the heterogeneity of imperial governance and educational initiatives. The German colonial empire varied widely across its territories, exhibiting diverse ruling styles and educational systems. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British encountered a considerable population of literate Africans, a testament to German educational endeavors in the region. However, the scenario in South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a markedly different picture. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in native education, the task of educating the indigenous population in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary societies with limited state support. Notably, the German government invested heavily in the education of European settlers, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support to missionary schools for settlers. This educational disparity left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted literate African populations, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority remained uneducated and illiterate,\" due to a combination of social, political, and economic factors. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly focusing on recent research into the mindsets of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a plethora of literature on education within the German colonial empire, much of it written in German and emerging during or immediately after the colonial period. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later works in English broadened the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in educational systems among different colonies. The most relevant to this paper is Cohen's comparison of educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, which discusses factors contributing to their differences. Cohen attributes many unique features of South West Africa's educational system to its substantial settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa, with a moderately temperate climate, was more favorable to European settlement compared to other German colonies, although much of the territory is arid. By 1913, South West Africa had nearly 15,000 European settlers, in contrast to the 5,336 in East Africa, the next largest settler colony.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music has witnessed an expansive growth over the last century, encompassing an array of genres that amass a vast landscape. The challenge lies in attempting to enumerate all the genres, as each—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has propagated numerous sub- and sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre Heavy Metal rock has demonstrated remarkable diversity and emotional range over the past four decades. It is characterized by a broad spectrum of emotions, predominantly on the darker side. This diversity stems from the early recognition of Heavy Metal's flexibility, leading to the creation of unique sub-genres, which, in turn, birthed sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nThe Heavy Metal movement today is so fragmented that it is difficult to pinpoint its core essence. It has assimilated themes from various genres, yet traces its origins to a specific starting point. To grasp the contemporary Heavy Metal music, one must first understand the movement's definition and its status as a movement rather than a mere genre.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be deemed the \"music of more\"—more bass, volume, aggression, and theatricality. Unlike its predecessors, Metal bands exhibit exceptional instrumental prowess. Moreover, the movement has been deeply entwined with drug culture, with the mid-70s psychedelic boom significantly influencing its evolution and sonic exploration. This association with drugs facilitated the creation of otherworldly recordings, often serving as a catalyst for the exploration of dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively untapped by mainstream popular music at the time. Furthermore, later generations of Metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, emotional depth of the Romantic era. Lyrics such as those from Helter Skelter by the Beatles exemplify this darker side, reflecting a journey through highs and lows, often attributed to drug influences. This song, considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, served as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier, darker tracks, demonstrating the Beatles' desire to match their intensity.",
            "Years prior to the inception of dreamlike works by Surrealist artists, Henri Rousseau was diligently weaving his own reveries, both literal and metaphorical. In 'The Dream,' a 1910 masterpiece by the renowned Post-Impressionist, we witness not merely a woman captivated by a landscaped dream, but also Rousseau’s own aspirations and internal conflict as a painter. Since embarking on his artistic journey, he harbored dreams of acceptance, admiration, and acclaim from peers and connoisseurs alike, grappling with the conundrum of either conforming to or emulating established painting styles for validation, or forging his own path, thus showcasing his unique creativity.\n\nTo fully understand 'The Dream' through this lens, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a French town in the northwest, his father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a comfortable living. Lacking formal art training, Rousseau was employed as a gabelou until the age of forty, working for France's municipal toll service, earning the moniker 'douanier' or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left him with only his daughter, Julia, and profound sadness, pushing him to turn to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike peers who romanticized the peasant in art, Rousseau was a folk painter, his dreams reflecting those of the average working class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance in the art world becomes more palpable when considering his background: he was untrained, began late in life, and was active contemporaneously with esteemed artists. Recognition for his work, however, came around the same time Matisse was gaining prominence. In 'Modern French Painters,' author Jan Gordon notes that while both were competitors, they differed in style, subject matter, and motivation: “Matisse painted to avoid triviality, while Rousseau sought to create conventional art to gain admission to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous intellects have contended that a profound bond exists between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I concur with this notion at a foundational level. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", aptly captures this sentiment: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The knowledge we acquire in life primarily comes through formal education or life experiences. Yet, we seem to grasp the essence of ethics and aesthetics intuitively, as Keats suggests, without needing formal instruction. Both fields strive to elucidate rather than dictate. We delve into the reasons behind a piece's artistry or moral merit, rather than establish rules for creating or evaluating such works.\n\nCritiques of art or morality often fall short of encapsulating the true nature of goodness or beauty. A discussion on the Mona Lisa's value might revolve around elements like perspective, composition, or cultural significance, but these fail to encapsulate why it's considered great art. More often than not, responses to a favorite work of art or literature begin with an enigmatic, inexplicable phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more detailed explanation. This implies that both art and morality possess an ineffable quality that transcends description. As Flannery O'Connor asserts, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, morality and ethics, despite our best efforts, cannot be fully articulated.\n\nThis ineffable quality, often referred to as \"je ne sais quoi,\" is their most potent attribute. It is this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics that binds them together. I believe that both fields impact us at a level that is felt but not fully comprehended, a notion echoed by Immanuel Kant's concept of the \"noumenal.\" This connection is especially strong in literature, as McKean posits, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is unique about the art, is its moral quality. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" Thus, I propose that this shared transcendental nature of ethics and aesthetics is what forges their deep connection.",
            "The contemporary Germany stands as a powerful entity, an amalgamation of cultural tapestries that unfurl from the alpine cradle of Munich to the Baltic seashore of Kiel. This cultural mosaic is evident from Cologne's riverine location, weaving through the nation's heart, and concluding in the Elbe-side city of Dresden in Saxony. Given this rich cultural blend, it is no surprise that the Germany we know today is a synthesis of diverse origins and tribal influences.\n\nThe ancestral home of the Germans, Germania, the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. Some attribute the name to a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who were known as such before crossing the Rhine to face the Gallic forces (Tacitus, 98). Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic War, initially used the term \"Germanus\" to delineate between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). The origin of the name remains uncertain, with some suggesting it derived from the Gallic word for neighbor, while others propose it comes from the old Anglo-Saxon term for spear, \"ger,\" or the Old Irish \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' reputation for loudness (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous to the region, untouched by foreign immigration or contact. He posed the question, \"Who would abandon a comfortable life in Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its harsh terrain, gloomy skies, and grim demeanor?\" (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, for their part, rarely ventured into Germania, preferring instead to lead occasional campaigns and trade goods and skills acquired from the region. Thus, as Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they remained on the empire's borders, trading their produce and military skills with the Romans (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I gazed vacantly at the tableau before me, a blank slate. Impartially, steadfast, my consciousness parsed the image without attachment to any abstract concepts. Ideas flitted through my mind like leaves in a breeze, appearing and disappearing in an instant. My mind was a conduit, not a creator. At some point, I procured an instructional volume called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" seeking to learn the art of drawing since my childhood. It offers insights into the mind's processes when interpreting lines and brushstrokes. One method it suggests is to impose a square frame around an image to simplify the scene. Yet, when I stood before the bowl of fruit and the expansive kitchen, I could not frame it as the artist's manual advised. I was paralyzed by awe, the masterpieces of Picasso and Monet dancing in my mind's eye. It was the genesis of my own artistic exploration, the inception of \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers danced with the brush, my muscles tensed and released, my intent taking form. The water was serene, clear, and clean. Matter broke away, swallowed by the void. My hand struck the toilet handle again, my second attempt more urgent. The offending package remained stubborn. I held the mop loosely, feet planted, tie knotted around my neck, my brow furrowed as I stared at the unwanted deposit. A few more flushes, a few more moments of reflection, and my hand reached for the wall, grabbing the toilet paper, wrapping it around my glove like a glove. Standing tall, then bent at the waist, my hand dipped into the bowl, a mother's gentle hand reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young adults often meet tragic ends behind the wheel. A convergence of several factors leads to this grim statistical trend for the youngest American drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the issue is that the immature adolescent brain is not yet equipped to handle the perils of driving. Additionally, their lack of experience is a significant contributor to this problem. This inexperience not only increases the likelihood of fatal accidents but also leads to more rollovers, speeding incidents, and driving off the road. Teenagers, predictably, are more frequently accompanied by peers, which is known to be a norm. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a notable correlation between the age of the passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. Many states, including California, have implemented temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely stopgap solutions. The core issue is that, collectively, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to manage the associated risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 years of age might be too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports Zuckerman's findings that individuals under 19 or 20 often crave thrill-seeking experiences. Thus, delaying driving until these tendencies subside seems sensible. If we persist in issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we may witness an escalation in fatal accidents, with the death toll potentially reaching alarming proportions in the coming years. The Baby Boomers' children will soon become eligible to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads. Legislation addressing this concern could be relatively straightforward. Educational institutions could continue to teach driver's education, with no one under 18 allowed to drive a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, followed by a full driver's license after a certain number of hours of practical training. The specific number of hours required could mirror the majority of states' current standards (for example, California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Given the national scope of teenage driver fatalities, unified, nationwide legislation on this issue would be sensible and potentially effective in safeguarding teens across the country. This proposed legislation is not an unprecedented idea.",
            "While perusing the Library of Congress's collection of vintage Edison films, I decided to examine all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on describing the poetic elements prevalent in most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of certain later films. Around the turn of the century, trick films were primarily confined within a stage-like setting, using a frontal proscenium with no camera movement. They typically employed long and medium shots, adhering to the single shot per film rule. However, some films in the early 1900s defied these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait of trick films is their filming within a static frame, reminiscent of early theatre and vaudeville stages. The camera remains stationary, allowing figures and objects to move horizontally but rarely approach or recede from the lens. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth, but the camera doesn't track their movements. Similarly, shots are usually long or medium, with close-ups being absent, mirroring the theatre tradition where the audience views the entire performance within the stage's frame.\n\nMost early trick films operate under the principle that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This practice also restricts their dramatic or narrative potential, with most films presenting brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot often consists of multiple physical shots joined together to create illusions, such as apparitions or vanishings. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, illustrates this practice, where the headless Mary's physical shot begins midway through the film, despite appearing as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and zealous advocate for Republican ideals. While he was primarily an agrarian, his foray into politics shaped him into a steadfast champion of personal liberties and governance. His commitment to an agrarian society underpinned his views on sovereignty, constitutional law, and even the judiciary. His dedication to preserving and promoting agriculture as the most superior profession influenced his arguments on these matters.\n\nTaylor held that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an ideal governance system, as there were no entrenched traditions to impede this process. He firmly believed in the interdependence of natural human rights and that they should be impervious to government intervention. He argued that, in the absence of civilization, the strong and cunning would thrive, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must acknowledge the inherent goodness and evil within people. He maintained a rigid dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is wielded by men, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" (Ibid., pg. 167) He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government rooted in these principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by self-interest. He viewed self-interest as a natural human trait, but considered it evil when it led to sub-societies that exploited others. A good government was essential to control man's inherent evil, but it must be vigilantly watched to prevent the infiltration of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, with no additional rights or powers than those explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could be costly and potentially despotic. However, he believed that a literal interpretation could be corrupt if not guided by the intent of the Constitution's framers. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly describes the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, a marked decline in commuter log submissions was observed in the third month. This prompted concerns about the potential causes. The arrival of winter at a New England campus could account for some of this drop, as commuting by bicycle or foot may have decreased. Additionally, December marks the end of the academic term, with students and faculty busied by end-of-semester tasks. The commuter log may have been overshadowed by these priorities. Furthermore, December's holiday season brings a temporary campus hiatus, further reducing the need to commute. The low February submissions remain unexplained. It's possible that projects like these experience an initial enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counter this, the Carpool Challenge Week, a March campaign, was introduced, which resulted in increased submissions. Maintaining project momentum, especially during holidays and semester breaks, was a significant challenge. Another hurdle was the cultural preference for driving, necessitating incentives for alternative commuting. Various prizes, including gift cards, were offered. While these were deemed sufficient initially, larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have further boosted participation. Varying prize values over time might have also helped.",
            "ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are financial instruments that aim to mirror indexes, commodities, or a selection of assets, much like index funds, but trade like stocks on exchanges. They offer diversification akin to index funds, along with the perks of stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and single share transactions. Despite their appeal, ETFs charge lower fees compared to typical mutual funds. However, they incur trade commissions, similar to stock orders. The array of ETF options is broad, but it's prudent for astute investors to scrutinize these claims, especially diversification's extent. We'll examine ETF IHF and its top ten holdings, representing 63.58% of its assets, to gauge if owning the ETF matches the benefits of owning individual stocks, and if there are superior configurations for better performance.\n\nTo simplify, we'll focus on these top ten holdings. We'll assess their representativeness of the ETF by calculating their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Returns, assuming the portfolio mirrors the ETF's asset distribution. From these calculations, a portfolio of the top ten holdings yields a 6.11% higher return with a lower Beta of 0.12 compared to the ETF. This suggests a portfolio of these top stocks could offer higher returns and lower risk. However, statistical significance isn't guaranteed.\n\nTo evaluate if these portfolios differ significantly, we'll determine the standard deviation of each top ten stock and normalize it to 100% for a comparison with the ETF IHF's total standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is frequently cited as one of his more notable compositions. Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in verses 6 and 56, a term traceable to Virgil's works. Virgil referenced Thulé as an island situated beyond the northern reaches of Britain, considered the boundary of known lands by the Greeks. Although Virgil's usage is undeniable, there's a more contemporary reference that merits attention. Poe had a strong affinity for German literature.\n\nThis use of \"Thulé\" carries significance as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt's book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" delves into the similarities between the two poets' works, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe. Goethe, renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published the first part in 1808 and the second part upon his death in 1832. Within the second part lies a poem entitled \"The King of Thulé,\" chronicling a king who, after his wife's death, descends into alcoholism and despair, ultimately taking his own life. The similarities between the king and the description in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, mirroring Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nPoe's usage of \"Thulé\" extends beyond \"Dream-Land.\" In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the phrase \"ultma Thulé,\" suggesting a connection to \"The King of Thulé.\" \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" can be viewed as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker's description of Thulé—a dark, lonely landscape haunted by friends—echoes the melancholic state of the king in Goethe's poem. This parallelism suggests that Poe may have stepped into the narrative of \"The King of Thulé,\" mirroring his own emotional turmoil. Goethe's influence on Poe is further underscored by his reputation and connections to other notable figures like Tennyson, whose works Poe admired and whose circle he would have encountered.",
            "In California, could an individual who suffered harm after slipping in a grocery store on spilled applesauce be awarded punitive damages, based on the store manager's awareness of past incidents and their inaction? A judge would likely not dismiss such a claim immediately. To claim punitive damages, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were willfully and consciously disregarding probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. In this case, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, could argue that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have known the potential harm of leaving the spill uncleaned, given the repeated incidents of customers slipping earlier. Although her argument about despicable conduct may not be strongest, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager's lack of response. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, but he was on dinner break and declined to address it. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the spill at 5:15 pm, but Martin again refused to act. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, resulting in a serious back injury. By this time, five such incidents had already occurred that year. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we are considering a motion for partial summary on the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual breaches if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm or, if no intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' safety. Courts have considered conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Back in 2019, I engaged in an educational exploration of Islam through a course at the Community Bible Church. The central debate that stirred our class was the nature of Islam, specifically if it was inherently antagonistic. This query feels even more pertinent today than it did at that time. Recall the seismic shifts in public perception of Islam and extremist groups post-9/11. The pendulum swung from a hostile stance to a nearly idolatrous tolerance. The notion of a president with the surname \"Obama\" being elected, with his familial roots in Islam, would have been unimaginable in 2001.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as depicted in his biography, presents an intriguing conundrum. My understanding of historical Muhammad led me to believe he imposed Islam upon conquered tribes, yet the narrative paints him as a martyr, humbled and misunderstood. This portrayal leads people to seek out and embrace Islam on their own accord. I find a striking parallel between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For instance, Muhammad's multiplication of sheep and milk to feed forty men echoes Jesus's feeding of the five thousand. This style of storytelling suggests Muhammad was divinely guided, not requiring validation through miracles, but merely embodying truth and wonder. This approach diminishes Jesus’s unique significance.\n\nMoreover, many accounts in the biography feel contrived, aiming to substantiate witnesses or conversions independently. However, these stories are often filtered through multiple layers of hearsay, diminishing their credibility. I find it problematic that the biography elevates Muhammad as a paragon of godliness, humility, wisdom, and gentleness, which contradicts historical accounts of his conquests and rule.\n\nThis approach bothers me deeply. If Muslims are aware of the historical Muhammad, the true history behind his rise to power and subsequent rule, it may challenge the revered image of him as a gentle, humble leader.",
            "The tenets expounded by Jesus during his tenure and the subsequent beliefs that emerged post-mortem, have evolved over time, shifting Christianity's trajectory away from its genesis. Observing this trajectory through a wide lens reveals a pattern of gradual deviation. Today's society demonstrates a heightened consciousness and an unprecedented inclination towards progress. While conservative factions persist, their impact on the whole is often negligible. Among Christians, historical awareness will burgeon in the coming years. A desire will spread, to differentiate the doctrines appended to Christianity over time from its original intent. This shift, though gradual, is inevitable: Christianity will revert to its essence, stripping away accumulated layers of doctrine, as if the clock is rewound. This reversion, sweeping through the United States and Europe, will inspire a new wave of adherents to worship as they did during Jesus' time, guided solely by his teachings. While the church's institutional strength will remain, the theological clock's backward movement will unify beliefs and practices, reducing diversity. This phenomenon is not unprecedented; history abounds with such reversals. For instance, Christianity once faced persecution under the Roman Empire, which later became a bastion of Christianity. The same country that once practiced African-American slavery now boasts African-American leadership. The Christian religion's future reversion will reverberate similarly, undoing history in its pursuit of authenticity and minimizing diversity. This process hinges on interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired post-Jesus' life?\n\nRetracing history, we find Judaism, Christianity's theological forebear, at its core. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the supremacy of Hebrew scriptures were entrenched by the time Rome seized Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish populace was not unified; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "I contend that Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" illustrates the innate avarice and egoism within human nature. Individuals are inherently driven to prioritize their own interests and well-being, disregarding those beneath them. The novel underscores this theme through various examples. One prominent instance involves the proprietors and overseers of the colossal factories. Their singular objective is to maximize their enterprises, without concern for any obstacle or consequence. Sinclair vividly depicts the environmental fallout, as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery highlights the owners' disregard for potential victims, both human and animal. They remain unperturbed by the factory's toxic emissions or the fetid waste runoff from the extensive pens surrounding Packingtown. The workers, too, are exploited, with their labor exploited to increase profits. The text notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are subjected to grueling hours and sudden mass layoffs without compensation or job assistance. In this time, scant regulations safeguarded workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to operate unchecked. The rigors of the system were such that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions both within the factories and in their surroundings. No entities existed to aid workers, and while unions were formed, they frequently exacerbated the plight of their members. The workers, trapped in this system, were likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Authors, in their literary endeavors, often employ various methods to evoke specific sentiments or viewpoints regarding pivotal subjects. Some of these strategies are more successful than others. In his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous techniques to achieve this. He often combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to create an atmosphere around a subject. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning and uses them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald utilizes this latter technique extensively, particularly with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns significance to these colors and later employs them to convey feelings associated with important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald ascribes to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a higher, more refined status and gray signifying older, faded elements. He establishes this significance early in the novel, using both colors repeatedly. Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted in white—Daisy in particular, as seen when she is “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster” (74). Similarly, characters like Nick, Tom, and Catherine are often dressed in white, such as Nick’s “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party or Tom’s “white shirt” (36) during his encounter with Myrtle. The only time white is not predominant is when Nick describes Gatsby’s party as having “gaudy primary colors” (40). Additionally, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to color ordinary subjects: Nick's commute takes him “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and the names on his party guest list are “gray” (61). The valley of ashes is filled with “gray cars” (23) and “gray land” (23), and even the dog-seller is a “gray old man” (27). After investing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity, beginning with Daisy. After a prolonged period without their use, Daisy is described as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster,” portraying her more as a uniform addition rather than a character. This technique is further applied to Daisy, as seen in her “gray haze of fur collar” (18) and another white dress (115), emphasizing her role as an object of desire rather than a distinct individual.",
            "San Diego County stands out for its agricultural prowess, largely due to its temperate and sun-drenched climate. Staple crops encompass tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A thriving demand exists for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region, with numerous local groups boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms extend tours of their operations and offer recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This setup allows landowners to capitalize on government programs while enhancing habitats for recreation and educational purposes.\n\nOrganic farming, while filling a profitable niche market, is accompanied by increased costs and labor demands. It requires meticulous manual management to control pests and weeds, and lacking chemical assistance, soil fertilization becomes more labor-intensive. Consequently, organic farming often experiences higher losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, small-scale organic farms lack the operational efficiency of larger entities. Benefits not directly linked to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, controlling invasive species, and manipulating plant growth to create specific habitats, can also add to labor costs.\n\nThe selected parcel, located near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, currently recognizing over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and certain butterfly species. Others, such as the California gnatcatcher, are on the verge of listing due to declining populations.\n\nHistorically, this land was inhabited by Native Americans for millennia, later settled by cattle ranchers and lumber operators in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. An examination of real estate listings led to the selection of this property for further research into available government programs. As a hypothetical model for farming this land, I identified a nearby organic farm.",
            "Cultural dynamics significantly influence the negotiation process. Culture can be viewed not only by what it embodies but also by what it eschews, and the meanings it conveys. It is not a monolithic entity, nor is it singular or standardized. Propositions such as \"all Russians are rigid\" or \"all Japanese are adaptable\" are oversimplifications. While recognizing the broad strokes of a culture is beneficial, a successful negotiator should delve into the nuances of how a culture's attitudes can shape the negotiation dynamics at hand. When engaging with an unfamiliar culture, it is natural to draw comparisons based on one's own cultural lens, but it is crucial to understand that these comparisons may not always hold true.\n\nGrasping a foreign culture or mindset can involve various approaches, from historical study to acknowledging its biases. Rather than passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one must recognize and respect its inherent values and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations where a weaker bargaining position exists. In a foreign environment, respect for established norms and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and propel the negotiation process forward.\n\nCulture isn't confined to national or international boundaries. Organizational cultures within a nation, such as corporate cultures, can greatly vary. These can reflect differences in work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For example, some companies might prioritize long office hours, while others advocate for a more flexible schedule. A company's philanthropic policies can also reflect its cultural values, ranging from encouraging employee-led initiatives to restricting charitable activities to authorized causes. Differences in American corporate cultures, even within the same organization, can demonstrate the diversity of thought within a single societal culture. Some cultures may appear more homogenous to outsiders, but a deeper examination reveals similar complexities.\n\nValues are particularly important in understanding a culture, as they provide the underlying motivations. If saving face or group harmony are valued, a negotiator will not publically humiliate their company or superiors to achieve a deal. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture emphasizing hard bargains may not be as eager to settle early. Acknowledging these cultural nuances before the negotiation commences can be advantageous, but understanding the individual aspects of the opposing party can further enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "\"One said aloud, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and was employed by St. Anselm when he sought to prove God's existence. This stance is echoed by Thomas Aquinas, who also advocates for God's existence. To compare their arguments, we must assume they both believe in the same deity, the one described in biblical texts. However, neither argument provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God.\n\nExamining St. Anselm's argument reveals a path of understanding through personal belief. He posits that one can find proof of God's existence within their own comprehension. While his logic is complex, it boils down to the idea that believing in God is inherent in our understanding and does not require external evidence. This concept is akin to faith, a central tenet in Christianity.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through reason and empirical evidence, negating the need for faith. This approach could aid in converting new believers, as it relies solely on logical persuasion. Aquinas presents five arguments supporting God's existence: change, cause, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He argues that the need for a logical necessity for God can be deduced without direct observation, much like knowing the features of a missing puzzle piece from the rest.",
            "In the distant epochs of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future sage, eventually known as the Buddha, entered the world. His life's journey encompassed an ascetic's renouncement and eventual enlightenment, giving birth to Buddhism, a faith now recognized as the most traditional form, known as Theravada. The religion has persisted for nearly 2,500 years, evolving markedly different from its original manifestation. This transformation is readily evident in nations such as Sri Lanka, where a peculiar ceremony, the water-cutting ritual, is annually observed. Both Buddhist monks and laypeople participate, despite the Buddha's teachings never having included this celebration. From the surface level of traditions to the core principles of salvation, the Theravada Buddhist community has necessarily adapted over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, some hostile and others benign.\n\nThroughout this discourse, several key terminologies will be frequently employed. The terms 'internal' and 'external' refer to influences originating from within and outside the Buddhist community, respectively. A 'hostile' force is any factor that harms or seeks to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of it. Conversely, a 'benign' force is one that does not intend to cause harm but may inadvertently do so.\n\nFirstly, a foundational understanding of Theravada Buddhism's core tenets is essential. Buddhists take refuge in the 'Three Jewels': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka, or 'three baskets' of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles can lead to the cessation of Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth, and consequently, the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for laypeople and monks alike, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicants), while monks follow a more extensive set of rules. The fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths, acknowledging the existence of suffering (Dukkha), its cause (attachment), and the possibility of its cessation.",
            "The United States and Mexico once engaged in a protracted rivalry that endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War in 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious and annexed Texas and the American Southwest. Besides this major conflict, several other skirmishes occurred between the two nations until the dawn of the First World War. The rivalry was fueled by key issues such as religion, culture, and vital material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dynamic is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Border-sharing nations often develop rivalries due to conflicting interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that only Mexico and Cuba have enduring diplomatic tensions with the United States (p. 41). Geographical proximity and historical rivalries contribute to these tensions, which do not typically characterize other Latin American nations' relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences further strained the relationship between the two nations, mirroring historical patterns of ideological clashes. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that Americans historically opposed certain ideologies, including Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). The rivalry between the United States and Mexico, though not a direct ideological struggle, was rooted in religious preferences and the lingering distrust stemming from the English and Spanish colonial past.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry, most of which were territorial in nature. Border raids and frontier issues were significant problems that persisted until both countries applied military force to their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it effectively ended when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, I was unexpectedly struck down by an ailment I had never known. At that time, I was a healthcare provider, a choice born out of a profound longing for the steadfastness and stability I did not experience in my youth. The refrain \"you'll always have a job, people get sick\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond, influencing my career path. Though my aspirations leaned towards science or journalism, preferably a blend of both, nursing seemed like a more practical, secure choice.\n\nHowever, here I am: nearing fifty, unmarried, financially strapped, and unable to work. After fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I've lost every material possession, save for the minimal essentials. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught on my security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life is certain, yet one truth remains undeniable: I could not have persevered for this long without the support of my family and a handful of devoted friends. When life's crises hit, one's resilience falters, leaving them feeling disarmed.\n\nMy message is simple: life's emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable. There are no assurances, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges are insurmountable alone.\n\nI acknowledge the need for Americans to stop relying solely on government solutions. We must foster trust in one another, learn to assist and seek assistance, rather than each person isolating themselves in their own survival plans. Our forefathers' resilience during challenging times was not a result of rugged individualism; it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that sustained them. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in covered wagons did not make it to the coast by themselves.\n\nTherefore, be prepared. I am. My emergency kit includes first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for window sealing, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and the resources, cultivating a small farm and preserving your own food is a commendable endeavor, as is acquiring a wood stove, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you stock up, also get to know your neighbors.",
            "The question of how organisms adapt and change over time is as pertinent today as it was in 1917 when D'Arcy Thompson mused that zoologists had yet to begin defining organic forms in mathematical terms. Recent advancements in mathematical modeling, however, have provided insights into the processes underlying evolutionary transformations. Our current investigation delves into how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with empirical studies, can reveal the mechanisms driving the magnitude and direction of evolutionary-developmental shifts. Utilizing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantifiable parameters that were subsequently employed in the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These models serve as a framework for interpreting the limits of possible morphological changes within Prunum, with results being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to illuminate macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nThe growth of a shell can be visualized as a continuous structure extending along a 360-degree path through space and time. Each loop or turn in this path, known as a whorl, spirals around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand varies, and the line connecting them is termed a suture. Typically, the largest whorl, termed the body whorl, is the final one, with the remainder constituting the spire. The apex and base of the shell are the top and bottom points, respectively, while the aperture is the opening through which the animal extends.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The common orientation, or apertural view, shows the aperture facing the viewer with the apex pointing upward. A method for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical position and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell, with whorls counted from this point, estimated to a quarter whorl.\n\nShells can be perceived as a series of apertures that evolve through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The trajectory of these apertures can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl’s aperture and the horizontal and vertical radii. Mathematically representing this trajectory allows for parameter adjustments and modifications in mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, the statistics of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have been relatively unchanged. While the nation is on course to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as those concerning water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health lags significantly behind the targets set for 2015. The underlying causes of these shortcomings will be examined, revealing a need to bolster the healthcare system rather than concentrate solely on specific interventions.\n\nThe percentage of births attended by skilled healthcare workers has improved, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot handle complex medical situations, leading to high maternal mortality rates due to complications like hemorrhage. Thus, the advancements in this indicator are somewhat deceptive, and much remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of diarrhea cases treated by healthcare professionals in children under five years old. Additionally, data on postnatal care is incomplete but indicates this area is a concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected, at about 4%. The urban c-section rate of 7% contrasts with the rural rate of 2%, highlighting inequity in healthcare access. Urban areas have better service coverage, while the poorest quintile faces a 27% gap in service utilization due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering steps to enhance neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the lack of service provision. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific approaches, or should it prioritize strengthening the overall healthcare system without concentrating on pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? Programmatic approaches are undeniably attractive, with their clear, manageable objectives and faster results. However, they also have drawbacks. Overinvestment in one sector can lead to reduced funding for others and draw human resources away from other areas, as demonstrated by the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning. Moreover, running multiple, uncoordinated parallel programs can result in duplicated services and increased paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and concentration on the upper classes of the era. Two works that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels incorporate an element of enigma and a penchant for the unusual, which is atypical of the period, thereby enriching the characters and offering deeper insights into their motivations and sentiments. Dickens' narrative employs a dream sequence to illustrate Oliver's inner turmoil and his struggle with the shooting event. In this passage, Oliver's lack of control over the happenings is highlighted, as he is helplessly carried away by an unseen force. The shooting is depicted as a recurring nightmare, with Oliver's senses dulled and his desperation evident. This sequence reinforces the idea that external forces dictate Oliver's fate, as he is unable to exert any control over his life. Moreover, it suggests a growing sense of resignation and defeat, as if Oliver is being broken by the circumstances, rendering him incapable of reacting.\n\n“And now, a multitude of bewildering and perplexing thoughts came flooding into his mind. He seemed to be still walking alongside Sikes and Crackit, who were heatedly arguing: for the very words they uttered, echoed in his ears; and when he attempted to focus his thoughts, … he realized that he was conversing with them…. Suddenly, he startled at the sound of gunfire; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights flickered before his eyes, and all was chaos and tumult, as some unperceived hand bore him swiftly away. Throughout these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy awareness of pain, which wore and tormented him continuously.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently utilize this mystery through dreamlike sequences, yet the content and purpose vary in each specific instance. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner self, his burdens, and his understanding of the true nature of the events unfolding around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience as if in a dream, while struggling to seek help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events, as well as the dire straits his health has fallen into, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, his senses numbed as he fails to notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; his despair is revisited, removed from the initial shock of pain, now constant and associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver's helplessness in the face of danger is emphasized, as he is unable to make any attempt to gain control over the situation. Furthermore, a sense of defeat is implied, as if old Fagin's influence has begun to wear him down, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have tried to make some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day? There was no such thing; it was gone as quickly as it had come – and night returned again; night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.”",
            "Two years ago, I worked in an after-school program, assisting elementary-aged students with various subjects. My proficiency in English and reading was particularly advantageous, but I was tasked with aiding a young boy named Adrian, who faced substantial difficulties in reading. The strangeness of his struggles was palpable—he could accurately pronounce some letters, while others were mispronounced, which was bewildering. Adrian spoke English flawlessly, yet the language barrier was undeniable. A breakthrough occurred when I met his mother during a babysitting session. She communicated exclusively in Spanish, and despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to convey essential information. It became evident that Adrian's reading problem stemmed from a poor understanding of the English alphabet, not his reading capabilities. I hope his situation improved since then.\n\nThis anecdote underscores the challenges posed by the language barrier in educational settings, especially in California. Sometimes, issues are not as apparent as they seem. Even proficient English speakers can struggle with reading. Addressing this problem requires a multi-faceted approach. In Adrian's case, targeted tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, was effective. However, for children who speak minimal English, the solution is far more intricate. No single method will suffice; the solution lies in integrating various approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system holds promise. It benefits not only Spanish-speaking students but all students. Research indicates that children in two-way bilingual programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and its perceived ineffectiveness, a widespread implementation could benefit all students. To achieve this, we should not mandate that all teachers be bilingual, but rather incorporate bilingual aides and tutors to support the dual language system.",
            "From a tender age, we're often taught there's something greater than ourselves, an entity or force beyond our grasp. Some find solace in organized religion, while others delve deep within themselves for answers. Many adhere to the faith of their upbringing, while a few vehemently reject it, believing only in their personal worldview. Our spiritual journeys often shape our identities, guiding us through the darkest nights towards the light.\n\nWhen I inquired about his favorite bird, my father replied, \"A cardinal.\" We sat on the porch, the rain drumming overhead as our cigarettes smoked beside us. The gutters channeled the rain, inundating the plants near the edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting a mix of reminiscence and search. His once full form had thinned, and his hair had receded. He stared silently into the rain, avoiding my gaze. His presence made me feel isolated, fearful, and unable to express my fears. I embraced him, sat closer, and joined him in watching the rain-kissed twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my birthday. The treatments prolonged his suffering, but also extended his life beyond predictions. The purpose of his prolonged agony eluded me. I questioned the existence of God, feeling abandoned.

            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" a blend of the old and new, a term coined by Ian Watt, is marked by both admiration and derision. It's been lauded for its 'terrible sublime' and dismissed for a lack of depth. The inaugural 'Gothic Novel,' Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" fused \"ancient\" and \"modern\" elements, birthing a new literary format. Walpole's work integrated \"old\" theatrical elements and a \"new\" natural mimicry, presenting a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, steeped in medieval theatre, architecture, and customs, was perceived as antiquated, contrasting with \"modern\" advancements. The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" and the personal novel narrative allows Gothic to endure and resonate across time. One enduring theme in Gothic novels is chivalry, a holdover from medieval times. Walpole, amidst political turmoil, may have yearned for the 'lost' morality of the past, reflected in characters like Frederic. Before his introduction, Frederic's description hints at chivalric traits: he's a prince, suffered tragedy, and is believed to have been slain by infidels, embodying the gallant and courteous knight trope (66).",
            "Supply chain operations, in essence, entail the intricate dance of moving goods from the point of customer demand through the intricate web of raw materials acquisition, production, and final distribution to the end customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a pioneer in the field. Oliver described this process as the strategic planning, implementation, and control of activities within the supply chain to fulfill customer needs promptly and effectively. There are six pivotal components to a well-oiled supply chain: production, procurement, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these components to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nProduction stands as the first critical phase in this chain. It serves as the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. Production planning entails deciding when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must first understand customer desires to make informed decisions. Market analysis provides crucial insights into customer demands. Once managers have a clear understanding of market trends and customer needs, they can determine what products to manufacture and in what quantities. Next, they must decide where to produce these goods, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Once the production location is established, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is a pivotal stage, requiring meticulous attention to detail to avoid costly setbacks. For instance, in my experience working at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had detailed processes for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes ensured smooth operations without confusion or inefficiency.\n\nThe second key aspect is procurement, or supply. This involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and forming outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, labor, and specialties. Managers must select the most suitable division for each product phase. Outsourcing can be a viable option to enhance speed, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. The primary aim is to provide high-quality products swiftly while minimizing costs or maintaining affordable pricing levels.",
            "In a bustling cityscape, a mysterious sign hints at clandestine activity: \"Adolf Hitler is alive in Myanmar.\" Ellen Page, the renowned actress from the film \"Juno,\" stands alone at a street corner, a cardboard placard held above her head, the cryptic message scrawled in bold letters. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military regime that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public protests in a decade, ignited by monks donning saffron robes. Initially, these peaceful gatherings were allowed, but soon the situation escalated into a violent conflict between the monks and the junta, with monasteries being raided and foreign journalists arrested. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the military, claims that the toll is far higher.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have suppressed dissent to maintain control over their citizens. The ancient Romans believed their emperors were chosen by the gods, and the Japanese considered their emperors divine figures. In contemporary times, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s stand as stark reminders of tyranny. The atrocities committed by Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich' during the mid-1940s are another notorious example.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz stems from his enduring career and his keen ability to orchestrate his band. His piano playing, often understated in many of the pieces selected for this assignment, belies his prowess as a composer, crafting intricate and multifaceted works that highlight the individual skills of his musicians. Ellington constructed a stage where soloists could freely improvise, while also writing tightly woven arrangements and phrases tailored to the unique styles of his band members, accentuating the ensemble's overall tone.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative sound and his approach to incorporating voices as instruments in his music. In \"Creole Love Call,\" he pioneered this technique, using voice to add textures and colors without lyrics. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece is a prime example of Ellington's ability to complement his soloists, a technique evident throughout his career. It features six choruses: the first is a call and response between the voice and reed section, with the voice starting smooth and melodic before transitioning to a rougher sound. The second chorus sees a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes blue notes. Chorus three is a sweeping clarinet solo in the high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. The fourth chorus mirrors the first, with the brass and reed sections echoing the call and response. The fifth chorus is the piece's climax, with reeds and a syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone flourish. Ellington's use of voice in this manner is indicative of a stylistic trait that runs through his entire body of work.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" a year later, Ellington combines his skill for tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase featuring \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by incorporating the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. This approach is further exemplified in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, is effectively employed to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she harbored an unquenchable yearning for an elusive something. This longing persisted throughout her teenage years, beginning at fourteen and remaining at seventeen. Initially, she sought a tangible object, yet her focus soon shifted to a more corporeal desire. Despite the attention of several boys, none sparked any genuine interest. She puzzled over her indifference, considering various theories but finding none satisfactory. Consequently, she continued navigating life, her desire unresolved.\n\nA mundane day at home was typically unruffled, with parents who maintained a peaceful demeanor. They rarely clashed, save for occasional disputes regarding her spirited independence. She was the offspring of a serene couple, yet she possessed an exuberant personality that made her a favorite among peers.\n\nToday's serenity was disrupted by a sudden commotion. As she traversed her home, seeking creative inspiration, a swift, distressed cry echoed from the kitchen. Rushing in, she found her mother on the ground, wincing in pain.

Doctors rushed to her side, and she was left in a state of anxious anticipation.\n\nHer mother had inadvertently toppled from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest shelf.",
            "This investigation aimed to demonstrate the correlation between adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (MedDiet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed score), and reduced likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The aMed diet, a variation of the MedDiet, is distinguished by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, coupled with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the MedDiet and risks associated with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial revealed that the MedDiet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior research did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, sans a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a 121,700 female nurse cohort in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made to account for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annals of 2007, the United States was struck by a financial storm of unprecedented magnitude. Unemployment surged, the housing market went into freefall, and many of the nation's largest and most pivotal corporations found themselves in shambles. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting us to delve into its origins and seek solutions to prevent it from recurring: what caused this crisis, and how can we mitigate future occurrences? Essentially, the root of this financial crisis was a combination of reckless political decision-making and an inadequate financial infrastructure that compelled banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into backing and repackaging these mortgages into CDO's and CDS's. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves strapped for capital reserves, which they passed on to the repackaged mortgages and, subsequently, the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999. The President, eyeing a second term, took measures to boost his popularity by easing lending regulations. This move set the stage for the sub-prime crisis just seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times sounded an ominous note in 1999, reporting that, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its extraordinary growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions, warning that, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble during an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economy's descent into chaos, one of which was the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively utilized in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets taking on excessive leverage in the housing sector, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nAs the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, constituting about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a significant discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under stringent regulation.

            "Ah, exposition. That section where you, as a writer, either soar to new heights or crash and burn. It's where your prose can either enchant or bore. Dr. Merlin, too, has had her share of shouting matches with her screen over too much information, and not in the exciting way.\n\nMy dear readers, you're likely aware of the crucial advice: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet, Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in web of words that might as well be a block of text with nothing happening. Or worse, an overload of information. Exposition, that sneaky little voice, whispers to get the history out of the way to reach the main events. Not to be confused with the other voice urging you to spill every detail, from birth to death.\n\nExposition means relaying information in a straightforward manner, typically through simple prose. In films, it's when one character dumps a load of information on another, akin to a long-winded soliloquy. In literature, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you're told about the heroine's first encounter with her beloved, their opulent wedding, and her husband's tragic demise. You wouldn't expect these events to span two pages, with each of them barely speaking. You'd hope the author invests time in the husband's character, showcasing his love through words and actions. Similarly, the heroine should demonstrate through subtle cues how her life was transformed by his presence. A thorough introduction to the husband's character allows you to emotionally invest in his fate and understand the heroine's world better. You'd mourn his loss with her, growing closer to her character in the process.\n\nIn essence, you should add substance to the skeletal outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, resist the urge to swiftly move past certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know about their past service in the Air Force, their current role as a gas station night manager, their marital history, their weekend hobby, their secret dreams, and their breakfast preference. Provide these details, but weave them into the narrative naturally.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The headline reported on a man in Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but the suspect’s name was Shad Hostettler. His mugshot was shown, and he appeared sinister. The story was covered briefly, focusing mainly on his apprehension. I thought the coverage was adequate.\n\nThe second story concerned an early morning shooting incident in the Sharon Woods area. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, was critically injured. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, possibly due to the victim’s racial background. I've observed that minority victims often receive less attention in media reports, especially compared to white victims. For instance, if a white child goes missing or is the victim of a crime, the media goes into a frenzy, but when a minority is involved, it's lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nNext, there was a story about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details about the potential scene were provided, and it was determined that the hole was caused by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter’s arrest.\n\nAnother story was about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. The forecast mentioned temperatures in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The coverage was brief, likely to keep viewers engaged.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF was also reported. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man in a hooded sweatshirt, around six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it unusual that so much emphasis was placed on his race and complexion.\n\nFinally, there was a report about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I wondered if they thought this sounded harsher, or if it was simply a formatting choice. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "Fraternal bonds are a unique tapestry, woven with threads of love, pride, envy, and malice. This profound connection, unlike any other, allows brothers to decipher one another's thoughts and feelings with an unparalleled acuity. In times of crisis, this bond reveals its true essence, both in its grandeur and its darkness. Embracing the emotions that stem from this bond is a heavy burden, as is understanding the reactions they engender. When one gazes into their brother's eyes, they see not an outsider's perception but their own true reflection. The mirror held up by their actions and their consequences unveils their genuine character.\n\nIn the narrative \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers navigate the labyrinth of these emotions. In a landscape richly painted and alive with detail, they set forth on a hopeless quest. The final scene is a clash of bitterness and intense pride, with only one brother's survival. The theme is evident through the protagonist's direct portrayal and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to one overriding emotion: pride. From their earliest outings to their fateful finale, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearned for a sibling to share his world with, someone to teach his skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" He wanted a companion with whom to \"…race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…\" Alas, fate dealt him a harsh hand, as Doodle was born with a frail heart, making it improbable he would survive, let alone participate in physical activities. This cruel twist shattered the young protagonist's dreams. He even grappled with dark thoughts, contemplating suffocating his brother with a pillow. However, his heart melted when Doodle smiled at him, instilling hope. This moment reveals the protagonist's heart, showing that his hatred wasn't absolute. Deep down, he had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The human cerebrum is an intricate, ingenious information-handling mechanism. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to contemporary, the analogies utilized to depict the brain have likewise evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, then a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into the mysteries of the brain, bear in mind that the utility of these analogies is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nData processing commences with inputs from our sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when gazing upon an image of a black cube on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates simple information like color, orientation, and border placement to determine that you are seeing a cube. Top-down processing employs the decisions made at certain stages of the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the cube. In this scenario, top-down processing might assist you in identifying the object as a black cube rather than a hole-shaped box in the white background.\nOnce information has been processed to some extent, an attention filter decides the signal's importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures that you do not individually notice them. Conversely, you might spot your name even when spoken amidst a cacophony of noise. There are innumerable stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are various types of memories, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Each sensory stimulus type has specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained via an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. Long-term memory information is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\nNumerous models exist for organizing knowledge in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In the futuristic realm of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" a stark critique of burgeoning technological advancements and capitalist systems unfolds. The society within is built on communal living, where individualism is shunned, and instant gratification is prioritized. From birth, citizens are indoctrinated into this system, making them pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller. A Marxist lens reveals Huxley's reservations about the development of these systems, with terms like homogenization and reification underscoring the work's commentary on economic flaws from his time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the concept of false consciousness, as the populace is kept in the dark about their true economic standing. This ideological control over the working class, evident in Brave New World's citizens, is reinforced by hypnopædia, which encourages excessive consumption and indulgence. The World Controller manipulates these desires, creating a hegeonic society where lower classes remain unaware of their manipulation. This is akin to the common folk 'investing' in a system that perpetuates capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, while aware, fail to challenge the status quo, with even characters like Bernard remaining content with their place.\n\nIn Brave New World, interpersonal relationships lack depth. Characters, even major ones, are depicted as one-dimensional, possibly hinting at the loss of free will and expression due to the rise of technology and capitalism. Emotions are kept superficial, with conversations focusing solely on physical attributes and shallow encounters. Each societal stratum's acceptance of their position in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role within the community mirrors Marxist ideas of the proletariat, who are persuaded of their supremacy so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for a couple of years now, spanning four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, and I'm not alone in this. My freshman year, I was assigned a room in East Halls, the easternmost residential area, barely next to the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building, near the campus heart, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially when the weather was against me. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that the East Halls dorms were once isolated by vast, unused land. Now, that space has been transformed into sports fields, new facilities like the Creamery and health services building, and encircled by apartments. As campus growth increases, commuting becomes more arduous. The solution? A bicycle. However, bikes alone won't solve the issue. Students must embrace them, and the campus must be cyclist-friendly.\n\nA friend who restarted cycling after a break shared his enthusiasm, \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said, \"it's just the most efficient way to get around.\" Cycling not only benefits your health but also your time. A bowl of oatmeal and some exercise can take you up to 30 miles. Like many students, I now reside off-campus, as distant as some dorms. My smartest move this year was investing in a bike. Commutes to classes in Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk from my place, now take just 5 minutes on my bike. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route, isn't always bike-friendly. Walking, while beneficial, is not feasible for me due to my busy schedule. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes each day. That's over two and a half hours per week, not including other classes, appointments, etc. Time I can't afford to lose."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

I am committed to the Division of Family and Children Services, where I wish to make a meaningful impact. The values that I bring to the table are service, respect, ethical integrity, and a dedication to fostering healthier relationships, both within families and in my professional development. These values are not merely professional aspirations; they are deeply personal convictions.\n\nMy path to this decision has been a winding one. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed numerous individuals grappling with their problems, often in unhealthy ways. This inspired me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a field I felt could equip me with the necessary tools to understand and help others. However, I remained uncertain about my career path after graduation. It was during a summer break, visiting a friend, that I encountered a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned that he had reported his situation to the police. Seeing an opportunity to assist, I offered my help, explaining my background to the officers. They requested my intervention, as they felt limited by their legal constraints. When I spoke to the parents, they seemed evasive, labeling their son's distress as a \"manipulative\" behavior. This experience solidified my desire to pursue a career in social work, where I could contribute more effectively to helping children navigate such complex family dynamics.\n\nSocial justice is another value that resonates deeply with me. While society often pays lip service to the importance of the individual, we are often encouraged to conform to societal norms. I choose to embrace my individuality and challenge these norms. Throughout my academic journey, I have stood up against social injustices, whether by expressing my unique identity, advocating for equality, or challenging discriminatory behavior. I am committed to advocating for social justice both within and beyond the social work field.",
            "The following document delves into the Biological and Sociocultural paradigms concerning insomnia. Biological models concentrate on inherited genetic information and health-related aspects, while Sociocultural models explore environmental ties with race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models, explaining selected research to relate and elucidate them. The research explanations and findings are then critically evaluated for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary, secondary, or other categories. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias; secondary disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental disorders. Other sleep disorders can stem from medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia hinders adequate or continuous sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia makes staying awake difficult for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias pertain to behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Mental disorder-related sleep difficulties arise from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders, Mental Retardation). The following review centers on insomnia and also addresses primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, inheritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the human GABAB receptor. A disruption or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and alterations would naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life aspects that require focus and endurance.",
            "This document delves into the three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with an overview of the disorder, followed by a detailed explanation of its diagnosis, which includes common indicators or \"warning signs\". The paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in a mainstream classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. In essence, CAPD is a disorder wherein the brain's ability to process sounds, particularly separating words and discerning conversation from background noise, is impaired. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing but struggle due to their brain's inadequacy in interpreting auditory information.\n\n\tThe roots of CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, initially labeled \"auditory imperception\" by researchers investigating communicative disorders. An Italian research team, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, initiated diagnostic tests for these children in 1954. Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961 further advanced understanding of the disorder's physiological basis, while a 1977 conference sparked broader research on CAPD.\n\n\tSymptoms of CAPD include difficulty localizing or recognizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, and identifying sound patterns. Individuals may struggle to differentiate changes in speech, such as sarcasm, and may be affected by the order in which auditory information is presented. Additionally, their ability to synthesize sound clues meaningfully and act upon them might be compromised.\n\n\tDiagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, which can be administered by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. These tests may consist of questionnaires, auditory behavior observations, and advanced acoustic signal recordings. Despite efforts, no single test or cause for CAPD has been consistently identified.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night suggests that while masquerade can be a tool for deceit over extended periods, it ultimately requires shedding the disguise to prevent self-forgetfulness. Disclosing the truth, however, poses challenges such as potential estrangement. The decision then lies between self-preservation and the maintenance of relationships. While some may accept the ruse, others may be offended.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender reversal, particularly Viola's case, raises significant concerns, namely the motive behind one's assumption of an opposite gender identity. Viola, a newcomer in a strange land, adopts a male guise for protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Her scheme succeeds but distances her from female companions, denying her important support. Moreover, her convincing portrayal leads Olivia to confuse her with her twin brother Sebastian, resulting in romantic entanglements: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, she faces suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nViewed through a modern lens, this might be seen as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires invoked by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario due to his male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? One might argue Olivia's behavior suggests she is merely reflecting the societal judgments of her time. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The sharp criticisms aimed at German colonial rule, especially its harsh treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa, are well-documented. Yet, reducing the colonial enterprise to such stark terms would disregard the heterogeneity of imperial governance and educational initiatives. The German colonial empire varied widely across its territories, exhibiting diverse ruling styles and educational systems. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British encountered a considerable population of literate Africans, a testament to German educational endeavors in the region. However, the scenario in South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a markedly different picture. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in native education, the task of educating the indigenous population in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary societies with limited state support. Notably, the German government invested heavily in the education of European settlers, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support to missionary schools for settlers. This educational disparity left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted literate African populations, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority remained uneducated and illiterate,\" due to a combination of social, political, and economic factors. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly focusing on recent research into the mindsets of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a plethora of literature on education within the German colonial empire, much of it written in German and emerging during or immediately after the colonial period. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later works in English broadened the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in educational systems among different colonies. The most relevant to this paper is Cohen's comparison of educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, which discusses factors contributing to their differences. Cohen attributes many unique features of South West Africa's educational system to its substantial settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa, with a moderately temperate climate, was more favorable to European settlement compared to other German colonies, although much of the territory is arid. By 1913, South West Africa had nearly 15,000 European settlers, in contrast to the 5,336 in East Africa, the next largest settler colony.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music has witnessed an expansive growth over the last century, encompassing an array of genres that amass a vast landscape. The challenge lies in attempting to enumerate all the genres, as each—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has propagated numerous sub- and sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre Heavy Metal rock has demonstrated remarkable diversity and emotional range over the past four decades. It is characterized by a broad spectrum of emotions, predominantly on the darker side. This diversity stems from the early recognition of Heavy Metal's flexibility, leading to the creation of unique sub-genres, which, in turn, birthed sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nThe Heavy Metal movement today is so fragmented that it is difficult to pinpoint its core essence. It has assimilated themes from various genres, yet traces its origins to a specific starting point. To grasp the contemporary Heavy Metal music, one must first understand the movement's definition and its status as a movement rather than a mere genre.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be deemed the \"music of more\"—more bass, volume, aggression, and theatricality. Unlike its predecessors, Metal bands exhibit exceptional instrumental prowess. Moreover, the movement has been deeply entwined with drug culture, with the mid-70s psychedelic boom significantly influencing its evolution and sonic exploration. This association with drugs facilitated the creation of otherworldly recordings, often serving as a catalyst for the exploration of dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively untapped by mainstream popular music at the time. Furthermore, later generations of Metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, emotional depth of the Romantic era. Lyrics such as those from Helter Skelter by the Beatles exemplify this darker side, reflecting a journey through highs and lows, often attributed to drug influences. This song, considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, served as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier, darker tracks, demonstrating the Beatles' desire to match their intensity.",
            "Years prior to the inception of dreamlike works by Surrealist artists, Henri Rousseau was diligently weaving his own reveries, both literal and metaphorical. In 'The Dream,' a 1910 masterpiece by the renowned Post-Impressionist, we witness not merely a woman captivated by a landscaped dream, but also Rousseau’s own aspirations and internal conflict as a painter. Since embarking on his artistic journey, he harbored dreams of acceptance, admiration, and acclaim from peers and connoisseurs alike, grappling with the conundrum of either conforming to or emulating established painting styles for validation, or forging his own path, thus showcasing his unique creativity.\n\nTo fully understand 'The Dream' through this lens, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a French town in the northwest, his father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a comfortable living. Lacking formal art training, Rousseau was employed as a gabelou until the age of forty, working for France's municipal toll service, earning the moniker 'douanier' or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left him with only his daughter, Julia, and profound sadness, pushing him to turn to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike peers who romanticized the peasant in art, Rousseau was a folk painter, his dreams reflecting those of the average working class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance in the art world becomes more palpable when considering his background: he was untrained, began late in life, and was active contemporaneously with esteemed artists. Recognition for his work, however, came around the same time Matisse was gaining prominence. In 'Modern French Painters,' author Jan Gordon notes that while both were competitors, they differed in style, subject matter, and motivation: “Matisse painted to avoid triviality, while Rousseau sought to create conventional art to gain admission to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous intellects have contended that a profound bond exists between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I concur with this notion at a foundational level. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", aptly captures this sentiment: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The knowledge we acquire in life primarily comes through formal education or life experiences. Yet, we seem to grasp the essence of ethics and aesthetics intuitively, as Keats suggests, without needing formal instruction. Both fields strive to elucidate rather than dictate. We delve into the reasons behind a piece's artistry or moral merit, rather than establish rules for creating or evaluating such works.\n\nCritiques of art or morality often fall short of encapsulating the true nature of goodness or beauty. A discussion on the Mona Lisa's value might revolve around elements like perspective, composition, or cultural significance, but these fail to encapsulate why it's considered great art. More often than not, responses to a favorite work of art or literature begin with an enigmatic, inexplicable phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more detailed explanation. This implies that both art and morality possess an ineffable quality that transcends description. As Flannery O'Connor asserts, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, morality and ethics, despite our best efforts, cannot be fully articulated.\n\nThis ineffable quality, often referred to as \"je ne sais quoi,\" is their most potent attribute. It is this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics that binds them together. I believe that both fields impact us at a level that is felt but not fully comprehended, a notion echoed by Immanuel Kant's concept of the \"noumenal.\" This connection is especially strong in literature, as McKean posits, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is unique about the art, is its moral quality. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" Thus, I propose that this shared transcendental nature of ethics and aesthetics is what forges their deep connection.",
            "The contemporary Germany stands as a powerful entity, an amalgamation of cultural tapestries that unfurl from the alpine cradle of Munich to the Baltic seashore of Kiel. This cultural mosaic is evident from Cologne's riverine location, weaving through the nation's heart, and concluding in the Elbe-side city of Dresden in Saxony. Given this rich cultural blend, it is no surprise that the Germany we know today is a synthesis of diverse origins and tribal influences.\n\nThe ancestral home of the Germans, Germania, the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. Some attribute the name to a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who were known as such before crossing the Rhine to face the Gallic forces (Tacitus, 98). Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic War, initially used the term \"Germanus\" to delineate between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). The origin of the name remains uncertain, with some suggesting it derived from the Gallic word for neighbor, while others propose it comes from the old Anglo-Saxon term for spear, \"ger,\" or the Old Irish \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' reputation for loudness (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous to the region, untouched by foreign immigration or contact. He posed the question, \"Who would abandon a comfortable life in Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its harsh terrain, gloomy skies, and grim demeanor?\" (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, for their part, rarely ventured into Germania, preferring instead to lead occasional campaigns and trade goods and skills acquired from the region. Thus, as Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they remained on the empire's borders, trading their produce and military skills with the Romans (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I gazed vacantly at the tableau before me, a blank slate. Impartially, steadfast, my consciousness parsed the image without attachment to any abstract concepts. Ideas flitted through my mind like leaves in a breeze, appearing and disappearing in an instant. My mind was a conduit, not a creator. At some point, I procured an instructional volume called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" seeking to learn the art of drawing since my childhood. It offers insights into the mind's processes when interpreting lines and brushstrokes. One method it suggests is to impose a square frame around an image to simplify the scene. Yet, when I stood before the bowl of fruit and the expansive kitchen, I could not frame it as the artist's manual advised. I was paralyzed by awe, the masterpieces of Picasso and Monet dancing in my mind's eye. It was the genesis of my own artistic exploration, the inception of \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers danced with the brush, my muscles tensed and released, my intent taking form. The water was serene, clear, and clean. Matter broke away, swallowed by the void. My hand struck the toilet handle again, my second attempt more urgent. The offending package remained stubborn. I held the mop loosely, feet planted, tie knotted around my neck, my brow furrowed as I stared at the unwanted deposit. A few more flushes, a few more moments of reflection, and my hand reached for the wall, grabbing the toilet paper, wrapping it around my glove like a glove. Standing tall, then bent at the waist, my hand dipped into the bowl, a mother's gentle hand reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young adults often meet tragic ends behind the wheel. A convergence of several factors leads to this grim statistical trend for the youngest American drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the issue is that the immature adolescent brain is not yet equipped to handle the perils of driving. Additionally, their lack of experience is a significant contributor to this problem. This inexperience not only increases the likelihood of fatal accidents but also leads to more rollovers, speeding incidents, and driving off the road. Teenagers, predictably, are more frequently accompanied by peers, which is known to be a norm. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a notable correlation between the age of the passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. Many states, including California, have implemented temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely stopgap solutions. The core issue is that, collectively, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to manage the associated risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 years of age might be too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports Zuckerman's findings that individuals under 19 or 20 often crave thrill-seeking experiences. Thus, delaying driving until these tendencies subside seems sensible. If we persist in issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we may witness an escalation in fatal accidents, with the death toll potentially reaching alarming proportions in the coming years. The Baby Boomers' children will soon become eligible to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads. Legislation addressing this concern could be relatively straightforward. Educational institutions could continue to teach driver's education, with no one under 18 allowed to drive a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, followed by a full driver's license after a certain number of hours of practical training. The specific number of hours required could mirror the majority of states' current standards (for example, California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Given the national scope of teenage driver fatalities, unified, nationwide legislation on this issue would be sensible and potentially effective in safeguarding teens across the country. This proposed legislation is not an unprecedented idea.",
            "While perusing the Library of Congress's collection of vintage Edison films, I decided to examine all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on describing the poetic elements prevalent in most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of certain later films. Around the turn of the century, trick films were primarily confined within a stage-like setting, using a frontal proscenium with no camera movement. They typically employed long and medium shots, adhering to the single shot per film rule. However, some films in the early 1900s defied these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait of trick films is their filming within a static frame, reminiscent of early theatre and vaudeville stages. The camera remains stationary, allowing figures and objects to move horizontally but rarely approach or recede from the lens. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth, but the camera doesn't track their movements. Similarly, shots are usually long or medium, with close-ups being absent, mirroring the theatre tradition where the audience views the entire performance within the stage's frame.\n\nMost early trick films operate under the principle that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This practice also restricts their dramatic or narrative potential, with most films presenting brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot often consists of multiple physical shots joined together to create illusions, such as apparitions or vanishings. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, illustrates this practice, where the headless Mary's physical shot begins midway through the film, despite appearing as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and zealous advocate for Republican ideals. While he was primarily an agrarian, his foray into politics shaped him into a steadfast champion of personal liberties and governance. His commitment to an agrarian society underpinned his views on sovereignty, constitutional law, and even the judiciary. His dedication to preserving and promoting agriculture as the most superior profession influenced his arguments on these matters.\n\nTaylor held that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an ideal governance system, as there were no entrenched traditions to impede this process. He firmly believed in the interdependence of natural human rights and that they should be impervious to government intervention. He argued that, in the absence of civilization, the strong and cunning would thrive, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must acknowledge the inherent goodness and evil within people. He maintained a rigid dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is wielded by men, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" (Ibid., pg. 167) He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government rooted in these principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by self-interest. He viewed self-interest as a natural human trait, but considered it evil when it led to sub-societies that exploited others. A good government was essential to control man's inherent evil, but it must be vigilantly watched to prevent the infiltration of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, with no additional rights or powers than those explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could be costly and potentially despotic. However, he believed that a literal interpretation could be corrupt if not guided by the intent of the Constitution's framers. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly describes the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, a marked decline in commuter log submissions was observed in the third month. This prompted concerns about the potential causes. The arrival of winter at a New England campus could account for some of this drop, as commuting by bicycle or foot may have decreased. Additionally, December marks the end of the academic term, with students and faculty busied by end-of-semester tasks. The commuter log may have been overshadowed by these priorities. Furthermore, December's holiday season brings a temporary campus hiatus, further reducing the need to commute. The low February submissions remain unexplained. It's possible that projects like these experience an initial enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counter this, the Carpool Challenge Week, a March campaign, was introduced, which resulted in increased submissions. Maintaining project momentum, especially during holidays and semester breaks, was a significant challenge. Another hurdle was the cultural preference for driving, necessitating incentives for alternative commuting. Various prizes, including gift cards, were offered. While these were deemed sufficient initially, larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have further boosted participation. Varying prize values over time might have also helped.",
            "ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are financial instruments that aim to mirror indexes, commodities, or a selection of assets, much like index funds, but trade like stocks on exchanges. They offer diversification akin to index funds, along with the perks of stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and single share transactions. Despite their appeal, ETFs charge lower fees compared to typical mutual funds. However, they incur trade commissions, similar to stock orders. The array of ETF options is broad, but it's prudent for astute investors to scrutinize these claims, especially diversification's extent. We'll examine ETF IHF and its top ten holdings, representing 63.58% of its assets, to gauge if owning the ETF matches the benefits of owning individual stocks, and if there are superior configurations for better performance.\n\nTo simplify, we'll focus on these top ten holdings. We'll assess their representativeness of the ETF by calculating their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Returns, assuming the portfolio mirrors the ETF's asset distribution. From these calculations, a portfolio of the top ten holdings yields a 6.11% higher return with a lower Beta of 0.12 compared to the ETF. This suggests a portfolio of these top stocks could offer higher returns and lower risk. However, statistical significance isn't guaranteed.\n\nTo evaluate if these portfolios differ significantly, we'll determine the standard deviation of each top ten stock and normalize it to 100% for a comparison with the ETF IHF's total standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is frequently cited as one of his more notable compositions. Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in verses 6 and 56, a term traceable to Virgil's works. Virgil referenced Thulé as an island situated beyond the northern reaches of Britain, considered the boundary of known lands by the Greeks. Although Virgil's usage is undeniable, there's a more contemporary reference that merits attention. Poe had a strong affinity for German literature.\n\nThis use of \"Thulé\" carries significance as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt's book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" delves into the similarities between the two poets' works, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe. Goethe, renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published the first part in 1808 and the second part upon his death in 1832. Within the second part lies a poem entitled \"The King of Thulé,\" chronicling a king who, after his wife's death, descends into alcoholism and despair, ultimately taking his own life. The similarities between the king and the description in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, mirroring Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nPoe's usage of \"Thulé\" extends beyond \"Dream-Land.\" In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the phrase \"ultma Thulé,\" suggesting a connection to \"The King of Thulé.\" \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" can be viewed as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker's description of Thulé—a dark, lonely landscape haunted by friends—echoes the melancholic state of the king in Goethe's poem. This parallelism suggests that Poe may have stepped into the narrative of \"The King of Thulé,\" mirroring his own emotional turmoil. Goethe's influence on Poe is further underscored by his reputation and connections to other notable figures like Tennyson, whose works Poe admired and whose circle he would have encountered.",
            "In California, could an individual who suffered harm after slipping in a grocery store on spilled applesauce be awarded punitive damages, based on the store manager's awareness of past incidents and their inaction? A judge would likely not dismiss such a claim immediately. To claim punitive damages, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were willfully and consciously disregarding probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. In this case, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, could argue that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have known the potential harm of leaving the spill uncleaned, given the repeated incidents of customers slipping earlier. Although her argument about despicable conduct may not be strongest, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager's lack of response. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, but he was on dinner break and declined to address it. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the spill at 5:15 pm, but Martin again refused to act. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, resulting in a serious back injury. By this time, five such incidents had already occurred that year. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we are considering a motion for partial summary on the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual breaches if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm or, if no intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' safety. Courts have considered conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Back in 2019, I engaged in an educational exploration of Islam through a course at the Community Bible Church. The central debate that stirred our class was the nature of Islam, specifically if it was inherently antagonistic. This query feels even more pertinent today than it did at that time. Recall the seismic shifts in public perception of Islam and extremist groups post-9/11. The pendulum swung from a hostile stance to a nearly idolatrous tolerance. The notion of a president with the surname \"Obama\" being elected, with his familial roots in Islam, would have been unimaginable in 2001.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as depicted in his biography, presents an intriguing conundrum. My understanding of historical Muhammad led me to believe he imposed Islam upon conquered tribes, yet the narrative paints him as a martyr, humbled and misunderstood. This portrayal leads people to seek out and embrace Islam on their own accord. I find a striking parallel between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For instance, Muhammad's multiplication of sheep and milk to feed forty men echoes Jesus's feeding of the five thousand. This style of storytelling suggests Muhammad was divinely guided, not requiring validation through miracles, but merely embodying truth and wonder. This approach diminishes Jesus’s unique significance.\n\nMoreover, many accounts in the biography feel contrived, aiming to substantiate witnesses or conversions independently. However, these stories are often filtered through multiple layers of hearsay, diminishing their credibility. I find it problematic that the biography elevates Muhammad as a paragon of godliness, humility, wisdom, and gentleness, which contradicts historical accounts of his conquests and rule.\n\nThis approach bothers me deeply. If Muslims are aware of the historical Muhammad, the true history behind his rise to power and subsequent rule, it may challenge the revered image of him as a gentle, humble leader.",
            "The tenets expounded by Jesus during his tenure and the subsequent beliefs that emerged post-mortem, have evolved over time, shifting Christianity's trajectory away from its genesis. Observing this trajectory through a wide lens reveals a pattern of gradual deviation. Today's society demonstrates a heightened consciousness and an unprecedented inclination towards progress. While conservative factions persist, their impact on the whole is often negligible. Among Christians, historical awareness will burgeon in the coming years. A desire will spread, to differentiate the doctrines appended to Christianity over time from its original intent. This shift, though gradual, is inevitable: Christianity will revert to its essence, stripping away accumulated layers of doctrine, as if the clock is rewound. This reversion, sweeping through the United States and Europe, will inspire a new wave of adherents to worship as they did during Jesus' time, guided solely by his teachings. While the church's institutional strength will remain, the theological clock's backward movement will unify beliefs and practices, reducing diversity. This phenomenon is not unprecedented; history abounds with such reversals. For instance, Christianity once faced persecution under the Roman Empire, which later became a bastion of Christianity. The same country that once practiced African-American slavery now boasts African-American leadership. The Christian religion's future reversion will reverberate similarly, undoing history in its pursuit of authenticity and minimizing diversity. This process hinges on interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired post-Jesus' life?\n\nRetracing history, we find Judaism, Christianity's theological forebear, at its core. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the supremacy of Hebrew scriptures were entrenched by the time Rome seized Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish populace was not unified; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "I contend that Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" illustrates the innate avarice and egoism within human nature. Individuals are inherently driven to prioritize their own interests and well-being, disregarding those beneath them. The novel underscores this theme through various examples. One prominent instance involves the proprietors and overseers of the colossal factories. Their singular objective is to maximize their enterprises, without concern for any obstacle or consequence. Sinclair vividly depicts the environmental fallout, as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery highlights the owners' disregard for potential victims, both human and animal. They remain unperturbed by the factory's toxic emissions or the fetid waste runoff from the extensive pens surrounding Packingtown. The workers, too, are exploited, with their labor exploited to increase profits. The text notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are subjected to grueling hours and sudden mass layoffs without compensation or job assistance. In this time, scant regulations safeguarded workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to operate unchecked. The rigors of the system were such that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions both within the factories and in their surroundings. No entities existed to aid workers, and while unions were formed, they frequently exacerbated the plight of their members. The workers, trapped in this system, were likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Authors, in their literary endeavors, often employ various methods to evoke specific sentiments or viewpoints regarding pivotal subjects. Some of these strategies are more successful than others. In his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous techniques to achieve this. He often combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to create an atmosphere around a subject. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning and uses them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald utilizes this latter technique extensively, particularly with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns significance to these colors and later employs them to convey feelings associated with important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald ascribes to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a higher, more refined status and gray signifying older, faded elements. He establishes this significance early in the novel, using both colors repeatedly. Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted in white—Daisy in particular, as seen when she is “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster” (74). Similarly, characters like Nick, Tom, and Catherine are often dressed in white, such as Nick’s “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party or Tom’s “white shirt” (36) during his encounter with Myrtle. The only time white is not predominant is when Nick describes Gatsby’s party as having “gaudy primary colors” (40). Additionally, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to color ordinary subjects: Nick's commute takes him “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and the names on his party guest list are “gray” (61). The valley of ashes is filled with “gray cars” (23) and “gray land” (23), and even the dog-seller is a “gray old man” (27). After investing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity, beginning with Daisy. After a prolonged period without their use, Daisy is described as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster,” portraying her more as a uniform addition rather than a character. This technique is further applied to Daisy, as seen in her “gray haze of fur collar” (18) and another white dress (115), emphasizing her role as an object of desire rather than a distinct individual.",
            "San Diego County stands out for its agricultural prowess, largely due to its temperate and sun-drenched climate. Staple crops encompass tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A thriving demand exists for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region, with numerous local groups boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms extend tours of their operations and offer recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This setup allows landowners to capitalize on government programs while enhancing habitats for recreation and educational purposes.\n\nOrganic farming, while filling a profitable niche market, is accompanied by increased costs and labor demands. It requires meticulous manual management to control pests and weeds, and lacking chemical assistance, soil fertilization becomes more labor-intensive. Consequently, organic farming often experiences higher losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, small-scale organic farms lack the operational efficiency of larger entities. Benefits not directly linked to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, controlling invasive species, and manipulating plant growth to create specific habitats, can also add to labor costs.\n\nThe selected parcel, located near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, currently recognizing over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and certain butterfly species. Others, such as the California gnatcatcher, are on the verge of listing due to declining populations.\n\nHistorically, this land was inhabited by Native Americans for millennia, later settled by cattle ranchers and lumber operators in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. An examination of real estate listings led to the selection of this property for further research into available government programs. As a hypothetical model for farming this land, I identified a nearby organic farm.",
            "Cultural dynamics significantly influence the negotiation process. Culture can be viewed not only by what it embodies but also by what it eschews, and the meanings it conveys. It is not a monolithic entity, nor is it singular or standardized. Propositions such as \"all Russians are rigid\" or \"all Japanese are adaptable\" are oversimplifications. While recognizing the broad strokes of a culture is beneficial, a successful negotiator should delve into the nuances of how a culture's attitudes can shape the negotiation dynamics at hand. When engaging with an unfamiliar culture, it is natural to draw comparisons based on one's own cultural lens, but it is crucial to understand that these comparisons may not always hold true.\n\nGrasping a foreign culture or mindset can involve various approaches, from historical study to acknowledging its biases. Rather than passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one must recognize and respect its inherent values and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations where a weaker bargaining position exists. In a foreign environment, respect for established norms and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and propel the negotiation process forward.\n\nCulture isn't confined to national or international boundaries. Organizational cultures within a nation, such as corporate cultures, can greatly vary. These can reflect differences in work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For example, some companies might prioritize long office hours, while others advocate for a more flexible schedule. A company's philanthropic policies can also reflect its cultural values, ranging from encouraging employee-led initiatives to restricting charitable activities to authorized causes. Differences in American corporate cultures, even within the same organization, can demonstrate the diversity of thought within a single societal culture. Some cultures may appear more homogenous to outsiders, but a deeper examination reveals similar complexities.\n\nValues are particularly important in understanding a culture, as they provide the underlying motivations. If saving face or group harmony are valued, a negotiator will not publically humiliate their company or superiors to achieve a deal. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture emphasizing hard bargains may not be as eager to settle early. Acknowledging these cultural nuances before the negotiation commences can be advantageous, but understanding the individual aspects of the opposing party can further enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "\"One said aloud, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and was employed by St. Anselm when he sought to prove God's existence. This stance is echoed by Thomas Aquinas, who also advocates for God's existence. To compare their arguments, we must assume they both believe in the same deity, the one described in biblical texts. However, neither argument provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God.\n\nExamining St. Anselm's argument reveals a path of understanding through personal belief. He posits that one can find proof of God's existence within their own comprehension. While his logic is complex, it boils down to the idea that believing in God is inherent in our understanding and does not require external evidence. This concept is akin to faith, a central tenet in Christianity.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through reason and empirical evidence, negating the need for faith. This approach could aid in converting new believers, as it relies solely on logical persuasion. Aquinas presents five arguments supporting God's existence: change, cause, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He argues that the need for a logical necessity for God can be deduced without direct observation, much like knowing the features of a missing puzzle piece from the rest.",
            "In the distant epochs of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future sage, eventually known as the Buddha, entered the world. His life's journey encompassed an ascetic's renouncement and eventual enlightenment, giving birth to Buddhism, a faith now recognized as the most traditional form, known as Theravada. The religion has persisted for nearly 2,500 years, evolving markedly different from its original manifestation. This transformation is readily evident in nations such as Sri Lanka, where a peculiar ceremony, the water-cutting ritual, is annually observed. Both Buddhist monks and laypeople participate, despite the Buddha's teachings never having included this celebration. From the surface level of traditions to the core principles of salvation, the Theravada Buddhist community has necessarily adapted over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, some hostile and others benign.\n\nThroughout this discourse, several key terminologies will be frequently employed. The terms 'internal' and 'external' refer to influences originating from within and outside the Buddhist community, respectively. A 'hostile' force is any factor that harms or seeks to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of it. Conversely, a 'benign' force is one that does not intend to cause harm but may inadvertently do so.\n\nFirstly, a foundational understanding of Theravada Buddhism's core tenets is essential. Buddhists take refuge in the 'Three Jewels': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka, or 'three baskets' of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles can lead to the cessation of Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth, and consequently, the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for laypeople and monks alike, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicants), while monks follow a more extensive set of rules. The fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths, acknowledging the existence of suffering (Dukkha), its cause (attachment), and the possibility of its cessation.",
            "The United States and Mexico once engaged in a protracted rivalry that endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War in 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious and annexed Texas and the American Southwest. Besides this major conflict, several other skirmishes occurred between the two nations until the dawn of the First World War. The rivalry was fueled by key issues such as religion, culture, and vital material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dynamic is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Border-sharing nations often develop rivalries due to conflicting interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that only Mexico and Cuba have enduring diplomatic tensions with the United States (p. 41). Geographical proximity and historical rivalries contribute to these tensions, which do not typically characterize other Latin American nations' relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences further strained the relationship between the two nations, mirroring historical patterns of ideological clashes. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that Americans historically opposed certain ideologies, including Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). The rivalry between the United States and Mexico, though not a direct ideological struggle, was rooted in religious preferences and the lingering distrust stemming from the English and Spanish colonial past.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry, most of which were territorial in nature. Border raids and frontier issues were significant problems that persisted until both countries applied military force to their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it effectively ended when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, I was unexpectedly struck down by an ailment I had never known. At that time, I was a healthcare provider, a choice born out of a profound longing for the steadfastness and stability I did not experience in my youth. The refrain \"you'll always have a job, people get sick\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond, influencing my career path. Though my aspirations leaned towards science or journalism, preferably a blend of both, nursing seemed like a more practical, secure choice.\n\nHowever, here I am: nearing fifty, unmarried, financially strapped, and unable to work. After fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I've lost every material possession, save for the minimal essentials. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught on my security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life is certain, yet one truth remains undeniable: I could not have persevered for this long without the support of my family and a handful of devoted friends. When life's crises hit, one's resilience falters, leaving them feeling disarmed.\n\nMy message is simple: life's emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable. There are no assurances, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges are insurmountable alone.\n\nI acknowledge the need for Americans to stop relying solely on government solutions. We must foster trust in one another, learn to assist and seek assistance, rather than each person isolating themselves in their own survival plans. Our forefathers' resilience during challenging times was not a result of rugged individualism; it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that sustained them. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in covered wagons did not make it to the coast by themselves.\n\nTherefore, be prepared. I am. My emergency kit includes first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for window sealing, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and the resources, cultivating a small farm and preserving your own food is a commendable endeavor, as is acquiring a wood stove, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you stock up, also get to know your neighbors.",
            "The question of how organisms adapt and change over time is as pertinent today as it was in 1917 when D'Arcy Thompson mused that zoologists had yet to begin defining organic forms in mathematical terms. Recent advancements in mathematical modeling, however, have provided insights into the processes underlying evolutionary transformations. Our current investigation delves into how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with empirical studies, can reveal the mechanisms driving the magnitude and direction of evolutionary-developmental shifts. Utilizing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantifiable parameters that were subsequently employed in the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These models serve as a framework for interpreting the limits of possible morphological changes within Prunum, with results being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to illuminate macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nThe growth of a shell can be visualized as a continuous structure extending along a 360-degree path through space and time. Each loop or turn in this path, known as a whorl, spirals around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand varies, and the line connecting them is termed a suture. Typically, the largest whorl, termed the body whorl, is the final one, with the remainder constituting the spire. The apex and base of the shell are the top and bottom points, respectively, while the aperture is the opening through which the animal extends.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The common orientation, or apertural view, shows the aperture facing the viewer with the apex pointing upward. A method for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical position and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell, with whorls counted from this point, estimated to a quarter whorl.\n\nShells can be perceived as a series of apertures that evolve through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The trajectory of these apertures can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl’s aperture and the horizontal and vertical radii. Mathematically representing this trajectory allows for parameter adjustments and modifications in mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, the statistics of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have been relatively unchanged. While the nation is on course to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as those concerning water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health lags significantly behind the targets set for 2015. The underlying causes of these shortcomings will be examined, revealing a need to bolster the healthcare system rather than concentrate solely on specific interventions.\n\nThe percentage of births attended by skilled healthcare workers has improved, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot handle complex medical situations, leading to high maternal mortality rates due to complications like hemorrhage. Thus, the advancements in this indicator are somewhat deceptive, and much remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of diarrhea cases treated by healthcare professionals in children under five years old. Additionally, data on postnatal care is incomplete but indicates this area is a concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected, at about 4%. The urban c-section rate of 7% contrasts with the rural rate of 2%, highlighting inequity in healthcare access. Urban areas have better service coverage, while the poorest quintile faces a 27% gap in service utilization due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering steps to enhance neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the lack of service provision. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific approaches, or should it prioritize strengthening the overall healthcare system without concentrating on pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? Programmatic approaches are undeniably attractive, with their clear, manageable objectives and faster results. However, they also have drawbacks. Overinvestment in one sector can lead to reduced funding for others and draw human resources away from other areas, as demonstrated by the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning. Moreover, running multiple, uncoordinated parallel programs can result in duplicated services and increased paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and concentration on the upper classes of the era. Two works that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels incorporate an element of enigma and a penchant for the unusual, which is atypical of the period, thereby enriching the characters and offering deeper insights into their motivations and sentiments. Dickens' narrative employs a dream sequence to illustrate Oliver's inner turmoil and his struggle with the shooting event. In this passage, Oliver's lack of control over the happenings is highlighted, as he is helplessly carried away by an unseen force. The shooting is depicted as a recurring nightmare, with Oliver's senses dulled and his desperation evident. This sequence reinforces the idea that external forces dictate Oliver's fate, as he is unable to exert any control over his life. Moreover, it suggests a growing sense of resignation and defeat, as if Oliver is being broken by the circumstances, rendering him incapable of reacting.\n\n“And now, a multitude of bewildering and perplexing thoughts came flooding into his mind. He seemed to be still walking alongside Sikes and Crackit, who were heatedly arguing: for the very words they uttered, echoed in his ears; and when he attempted to focus his thoughts, … he realized that he was conversing with them…. Suddenly, he startled at the sound of gunfire; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights flickered before his eyes, and all was chaos and tumult, as some unperceived hand bore him swiftly away. Throughout these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy awareness of pain, which wore and tormented him continuously.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently utilize this mystery through dreamlike sequences, yet the content and purpose vary in each specific instance. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner self, his burdens, and his understanding of the true nature of the events unfolding around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience as if in a dream, while struggling to seek help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events, as well as the dire straits his health has fallen into, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, his senses numbed as he fails to notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; his despair is revisited, removed from the initial shock of pain, now constant and associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver's helplessness in the face of danger is emphasized, as he is unable to make any attempt to gain control over the situation. Furthermore, a sense of defeat is implied, as if old Fagin's influence has begun to wear him down, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have tried to make some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day? There was no such thing; it was gone as quickly as it had come – and night returned again; night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.”",
            "Two years ago, I worked in an after-school program, assisting elementary-aged students with various subjects. My proficiency in English and reading was particularly advantageous, but I was tasked with aiding a young boy named Adrian, who faced substantial difficulties in reading. The strangeness of his struggles was palpable—he could accurately pronounce some letters, while others were mispronounced, which was bewildering. Adrian spoke English flawlessly, yet the language barrier was undeniable. A breakthrough occurred when I met his mother during a babysitting session. She communicated exclusively in Spanish, and despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to convey essential information. It became evident that Adrian's reading problem stemmed from a poor understanding of the English alphabet, not his reading capabilities. I hope his situation improved since then.\n\nThis anecdote underscores the challenges posed by the language barrier in educational settings, especially in California. Sometimes, issues are not as apparent as they seem. Even proficient English speakers can struggle with reading. Addressing this problem requires a multi-faceted approach. In Adrian's case, targeted tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, was effective. However, for children who speak minimal English, the solution is far more intricate. No single method will suffice; the solution lies in integrating various approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system holds promise. It benefits not only Spanish-speaking students but all students. Research indicates that children in two-way bilingual programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and its perceived ineffectiveness, a widespread implementation could benefit all students. To achieve this, we should not mandate that all teachers be bilingual, but rather incorporate bilingual aides and tutors to support the dual language system.",
            "From a tender age, we're often taught there's something greater than ourselves, an entity or force beyond our grasp. Some find solace in organized religion, while others delve deep within themselves for answers. Many adhere to the faith of their upbringing, while a few vehemently reject it, believing only in their personal worldview. Our spiritual journeys often shape our identities, guiding us through the darkest nights towards the light.\n\nWhen I inquired about his favorite bird, my father replied, \"A cardinal.\" We sat on the porch, the rain drumming overhead as our cigarettes smoked beside us. The gutters channeled the rain, inundating the plants near the edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting a mix of reminiscence and search. His once full form had thinned, and his hair had receded. He stared silently into the rain, avoiding my gaze. His presence made me feel isolated, fearful, and unable to express my fears. I embraced him, sat closer, and joined him in watching the rain-kissed twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my birthday. The treatments prolonged his suffering, but also extended his life beyond predictions. The purpose of his prolonged agony eluded me. I questioned the existence of God, feeling abandoned.

            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" a blend of the old and new, a term coined by Ian Watt, is marked by both admiration and derision. It's been lauded for its 'terrible sublime' and dismissed for a lack of depth. The inaugural 'Gothic Novel,' Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" fused \"ancient\" and \"modern\" elements, birthing a new literary format. Walpole's work integrated \"old\" theatrical elements and a \"new\" natural mimicry, presenting a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, steeped in medieval theatre, architecture, and customs, was perceived as antiquated, contrasting with \"modern\" advancements. The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" and the personal novel narrative allows Gothic to endure and resonate across time. One enduring theme in Gothic novels is chivalry, a holdover from medieval times. Walpole, amidst political turmoil, may have yearned for the 'lost' morality of the past, reflected in characters like Frederic. Before his introduction, Frederic's description hints at chivalric traits: he's a prince, suffered tragedy, and is believed to have been slain by infidels, embodying the gallant and courteous knight trope (66).",
            "Supply chain operations, in essence, entail the intricate dance of moving goods from the point of customer demand through the intricate web of raw materials acquisition, production, and final distribution to the end customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a pioneer in the field. Oliver described this process as the strategic planning, implementation, and control of activities within the supply chain to fulfill customer needs promptly and effectively. There are six pivotal components to a well-oiled supply chain: production, procurement, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these components to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nProduction stands as the first critical phase in this chain. It serves as the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. Production planning entails deciding when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must first understand customer desires to make informed decisions. Market analysis provides crucial insights into customer demands. Once managers have a clear understanding of market trends and customer needs, they can determine what products to manufacture and in what quantities. Next, they must decide where to produce these goods, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Once the production location is established, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is a pivotal stage, requiring meticulous attention to detail to avoid costly setbacks. For instance, in my experience working at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had detailed processes for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes ensured smooth operations without confusion or inefficiency.\n\nThe second key aspect is procurement, or supply. This involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and forming outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, labor, and specialties. Managers must select the most suitable division for each product phase. Outsourcing can be a viable option to enhance speed, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. The primary aim is to provide high-quality products swiftly while minimizing costs or maintaining affordable pricing levels.",
            "In a bustling cityscape, a mysterious sign hints at clandestine activity: \"Adolf Hitler is alive in Myanmar.\" Ellen Page, the renowned actress from the film \"Juno,\" stands alone at a street corner, a cardboard placard held above her head, the cryptic message scrawled in bold letters. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military regime that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public protests in a decade, ignited by monks donning saffron robes. Initially, these peaceful gatherings were allowed, but soon the situation escalated into a violent conflict between the monks and the junta, with monasteries being raided and foreign journalists arrested. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the military, claims that the toll is far higher.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have suppressed dissent to maintain control over their citizens. The ancient Romans believed their emperors were chosen by the gods, and the Japanese considered their emperors divine figures. In contemporary times, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s stand as stark reminders of tyranny. The atrocities committed by Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich' during the mid-1940s are another notorious example.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz stems from his enduring career and his keen ability to orchestrate his band. His piano playing, often understated in many of the pieces selected for this assignment, belies his prowess as a composer, crafting intricate and multifaceted works that highlight the individual skills of his musicians. Ellington constructed a stage where soloists could freely improvise, while also writing tightly woven arrangements and phrases tailored to the unique styles of his band members, accentuating the ensemble's overall tone.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative sound and his approach to incorporating voices as instruments in his music. In \"Creole Love Call,\" he pioneered this technique, using voice to add textures and colors without lyrics. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece is a prime example of Ellington's ability to complement his soloists, a technique evident throughout his career. It features six choruses: the first is a call and response between the voice and reed section, with the voice starting smooth and melodic before transitioning to a rougher sound. The second chorus sees a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes blue notes. Chorus three is a sweeping clarinet solo in the high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. The fourth chorus mirrors the first, with the brass and reed sections echoing the call and response. The fifth chorus is the piece's climax, with reeds and a syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone flourish. Ellington's use of voice in this manner is indicative of a stylistic trait that runs through his entire body of work.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" a year later, Ellington combines his skill for tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase featuring \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by incorporating the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. This approach is further exemplified in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, is effectively employed to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she harbored an unquenchable yearning for an elusive something. This longing persisted throughout her teenage years, beginning at fourteen and remaining at seventeen. Initially, she sought a tangible object, yet her focus soon shifted to a more corporeal desire. Despite the attention of several boys, none sparked any genuine interest. She puzzled over her indifference, considering various theories but finding none satisfactory. Consequently, she continued navigating life, her desire unresolved.\n\nA mundane day at home was typically unruffled, with parents who maintained a peaceful demeanor. They rarely clashed, save for occasional disputes regarding her spirited independence. She was the offspring of a serene couple, yet she possessed an exuberant personality that made her a favorite among peers.\n\nToday's serenity was disrupted by a sudden commotion. As she traversed her home, seeking creative inspiration, a swift, distressed cry echoed from the kitchen. Rushing in, she found her mother on the ground, wincing in pain. She knelt beside her, offering assistance. \"Mom, what happened?\" she cried. Her mother's words were rushed and strained. \"Hospital... need... you.\" Gently, she supported her and, thankful for her strength training, carried her to the car.

Doctors rushed to her side, and she was left in a state of anxious anticipation.\n\nHer mother had inadvertently toppled from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest shelf.",
            "This investigation aimed to demonstrate the correlation between adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (MedDiet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed score), and reduced likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The aMed diet, a variation of the MedDiet, is distinguished by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, coupled with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the MedDiet and risks associated with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial revealed that the MedDiet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior research did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, sans a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a 121,700 female nurse cohort in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made to account for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annals of 2007, the United States was struck by a financial storm of unprecedented magnitude. Unemployment surged, the housing market went into freefall, and many of the nation's largest and most pivotal corporations found themselves in shambles. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting us to delve into its origins and seek solutions to prevent it from recurring: what caused this crisis, and how can we mitigate future occurrences? Essentially, the root of this financial crisis was a combination of reckless political decision-making and an inadequate financial infrastructure that compelled banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into backing and repackaging these mortgages into CDO's and CDS's. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves strapped for capital reserves, which they passed on to the repackaged mortgages and, subsequently, the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999. The President, eyeing a second term, took measures to boost his popularity by easing lending regulations. This move set the stage for the sub-prime crisis just seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times sounded an ominous note in 1999, reporting that, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its extraordinary growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions, warning that, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble during an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economy's descent into chaos, one of which was the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively utilized in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets taking on excessive leverage in the housing sector, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nAs the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, constituting about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a significant discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That section where you, as a writer, either soar to new heights or crash and burn. It's where your prose can either enchant or bore. Dr. Merlin, too, has had her share of shouting matches with her screen over too much information, and not in the exciting way.\n\nMy dear readers, you're likely aware of the crucial advice: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet, Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in web of words that might as well be a block of text with nothing happening. Or worse, an overload of information. Exposition, that sneaky little voice, whispers to get the history out of the way to reach the main events. Not to be confused with the other voice urging you to spill every detail, from birth to death.\n\nExposition means relaying information in a straightforward manner, typically through simple prose. In films, it's when one character dumps a load of information on another, akin to a long-winded soliloquy. In literature, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you're told about the heroine's first encounter with her beloved, their opulent wedding, and her husband's tragic demise. You wouldn't expect these events to span two pages, with each of them barely speaking. You'd hope the author invests time in the husband's character, showcasing his love through words and actions. Similarly, the heroine should demonstrate through subtle cues how her life was transformed by his presence. A thorough introduction to the husband's character allows you to emotionally invest in his fate and understand the heroine's world better. You'd mourn his loss with her, growing closer to her character in the process.\n\nIn essence, you should add substance to the skeletal outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, resist the urge to swiftly move past certain elements.

            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The headline reported on a man in Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but the suspect’s name was Shad Hostettler. His mugshot was shown, and he appeared sinister. The story was covered briefly, focusing mainly on his apprehension. I thought the coverage was adequate.\n\nThe second story concerned an early morning shooting incident in the Sharon Woods area. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, was critically injured. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, possibly due to the victim’s racial background. I've observed that minority victims often receive less attention in media reports, especially compared to white victims. For instance, if a white child goes missing or is the victim of a crime, the media goes into a frenzy, but when a minority is involved, it's lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nNext, there was a story about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details about the potential scene were provided, and it was determined that the hole was caused by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter’s arrest.\n\nAnother story was about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. The forecast mentioned temperatures in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The coverage was brief, likely to keep viewers engaged.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF was also reported. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man in a hooded sweatshirt, around six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it unusual that so much emphasis was placed on his race and complexion.\n\nFinally, there was a report about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I wondered if they thought this sounded harsher, or if it was simply a formatting choice. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "Fraternal bonds are a unique tapestry, woven with threads of love, pride, envy, and malice. This profound connection, unlike any other, allows brothers to decipher one another's thoughts and feelings with an unparalleled acuity. In times of crisis, this bond reveals its true essence, both in its grandeur and its darkness. Embracing the emotions that stem from this bond is a heavy burden, as is understanding the reactions they engender. When one gazes into their brother's eyes, they see not an outsider's perception but their own true reflection. The mirror held up by their actions and their consequences unveils their genuine character.\n\nIn the narrative \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers navigate the labyrinth of these emotions. In a landscape richly painted and alive with detail, they set forth on a hopeless quest. The final scene is a clash of bitterness and intense pride, with only one brother's survival. The theme is evident through the protagonist's direct portrayal and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to one overriding emotion: pride. From their earliest outings to their fateful finale, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearned for a sibling to share his world with, someone to teach his skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" He wanted a companion with whom to \"…race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…\" Alas, fate dealt him a harsh hand, as Doodle was born with a frail heart, making it improbable he would survive, let alone participate in physical activities. This cruel twist shattered the young protagonist's dreams. He even grappled with dark thoughts, contemplating suffocating his brother with a pillow. However, his heart melted when Doodle smiled at him, instilling hope. This moment reveals the protagonist's heart, showing that his hatred wasn't absolute. Deep down, he had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The human cerebrum is an intricate, ingenious information-handling mechanism. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to contemporary, the analogies utilized to depict the brain have likewise evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, then a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into the mysteries of the brain, bear in mind that the utility of these analogies is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nData processing commences with inputs from our sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when gazing upon an image of a black cube on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates simple information like color, orientation, and border placement to determine that you are seeing a cube. Top-down processing employs the decisions made at certain stages of the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the cube. In this scenario, top-down processing might assist you in identifying the object as a black cube rather than a hole-shaped box in the white background.\nOnce information has been processed to some extent, an attention filter decides the signal's importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures that you do not individually notice them. Conversely, you might spot your name even when spoken amidst a cacophony of noise. There are innumerable stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are various types of memories, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Each sensory stimulus type has specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained via an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. Long-term memory information is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\nNumerous models exist for organizing knowledge in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In the futuristic realm of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" a stark critique of burgeoning technological advancements and capitalist systems unfolds. The society within is built on communal living, where individualism is shunned, and instant gratification is prioritized. From birth, citizens are indoctrinated into this system, making them pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller. A Marxist lens reveals Huxley's reservations about the development of these systems, with terms like homogenization and reification underscoring the work's commentary on economic flaws from his time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the concept of false consciousness, as the populace is kept in the dark about their true economic standing. This ideological control over the working class, evident in Brave New World's citizens, is reinforced by hypnopædia, which encourages excessive consumption and indulgence. The World Controller manipulates these desires, creating a hegeonic society where lower classes remain unaware of their manipulation. This is akin to the common folk 'investing' in a system that perpetuates capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, while aware, fail to challenge the status quo, with even characters like Bernard remaining content with their place.\n\nIn Brave New World, interpersonal relationships lack depth. Characters, even major ones, are depicted as one-dimensional, possibly hinting at the loss of free will and expression due to the rise of technology and capitalism. Emotions are kept superficial, with conversations focusing solely on physical attributes and shallow encounters. Each societal stratum's acceptance of their position in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role within the community mirrors Marxist ideas of the proletariat, who are persuaded of their supremacy so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for a couple of years now, spanning four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, and I'm not alone in this. My freshman year, I was assigned a room in East Halls, the easternmost residential area, barely next to the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building, near the campus heart, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially when the weather was against me. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that the East Halls dorms were once isolated by vast, unused land. Now, that space has been transformed into sports fields, new facilities like the Creamery and health services building, and encircled by apartments. As campus growth increases, commuting becomes more arduous. The solution? A bicycle. However, bikes alone won't solve the issue. Students must embrace them, and the campus must be cyclist-friendly.\n\nA friend who restarted cycling after a break shared his enthusiasm, \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said, \"it's just the most efficient way to get around.\" Cycling not only benefits your health but also your time. A bowl of oatmeal and some exercise can take you up to 30 miles. Like many students, I now reside off-campus, as distant as some dorms. My smartest move this year was investing in a bike. Commutes to classes in Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk from my place, now take just 5 minutes on my bike. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route, isn't always bike-friendly. Walking, while beneficial, is not feasible for me due to my busy schedule. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes each day. That's over two and a half hours per week, not including other classes, appointments, etc. Time I can't afford to lose."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

These values are not merely professional aspirations; they are deeply personal convictions.\n\nMy path to this decision has been a winding one. Throughout high school and college, I witnessed numerous individuals grappling with their problems, often in unhealthy ways. This inspired me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, a field I felt could equip me with the necessary tools to understand and help others. However, I remained uncertain about my career path after graduation. It was during a summer break, visiting a friend, that I encountered a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned that he had reported his situation to the police. Seeing an opportunity to assist, I offered my help, explaining my background to the officers. They requested my intervention, as they felt limited by their legal constraints. When I spoke to the parents, they seemed evasive, labeling their son's distress as a \"manipulative\" behavior. This experience solidified my desire to pursue a career in social work, where I could contribute more effectively to helping children navigate such complex family dynamics.\n\nSocial justice is another value that resonates deeply with me. While society often pays lip service to the importance of the individual, we are often encouraged to conform to societal norms. I choose to embrace my individuality and challenge these norms. Throughout my academic journey, I have stood up against social injustices, whether by expressing my unique identity, advocating for equality, or challenging discriminatory behavior.

            "The following document delves into the Biological and Sociocultural paradigms concerning insomnia. Biological models concentrate on inherited genetic information and health-related aspects, while Sociocultural models explore environmental ties with race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia examines these models, explaining selected research to relate and elucidate them. The research explanations and findings are then critically evaluated for their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary, secondary, or other categories. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias; secondary disorders are linked to Axis I or Axis II mental disorders. Other sleep disorders can stem from medical complications or substance intake. Dyssomnias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). Primary Insomnia hinders adequate or continuous sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia makes staying awake difficult for at least a month. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/or automatic REM episodes. Dyssomnias focus on initiating and maintaining sleep, whereas Parasomnias pertain to behavioral abnormalities or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias include Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Mental disorder-related sleep difficulties arise from Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders, Mental Retardation). The following review centers on insomnia and also addresses primary sleep disorders in relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genes, inheritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspects. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study with mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons control sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep. A GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). This suggests animal models can be generalized to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the human GABAB receptor. A disruption or absence of this receptor could impair adequate sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep, and alterations would naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life aspects that require focus and endurance.",
            "This document delves into the three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). It begins with an overview of the disorder, followed by a detailed explanation of its diagnosis, which includes common indicators or \"warning signs\". The paper concludes with strategies for a teacher in a mainstream classroom to support a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), pertains to how efficiently and effectively the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. In essence, CAPD is a disorder wherein the brain's ability to process sounds, particularly separating words and discerning conversation from background noise, is impaired. Individuals with CAPD have normal hearing but struggle due to their brain's inadequacy in interpreting auditory information.\n\n\tThe roots of CAPD date back to the mid-1950s, initially labeled \"auditory imperception\" by researchers investigating communicative disorders. An Italian research team, Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, initiated diagnostic tests for these children in 1954. Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing in 1961 further advanced understanding of the disorder's physiological basis, while a 1977 conference sparked broader research on CAPD.\n\n\tSymptoms of CAPD include difficulty localizing or recognizing sounds, distinguishing between multiple sounds, and identifying sound patterns. Individuals may struggle to differentiate changes in speech, such as sarcasm, and may be affected by the order in which auditory information is presented. Additionally, their ability to synthesize sound clues meaningfully and act upon them might be compromised.\n\n\tDiagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests, which can be administered by various professionals, including audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. These tests may consist of questionnaires, auditory behavior observations, and advanced acoustic signal recordings. Despite efforts, no single test or cause for CAPD has been consistently identified.",
            "Shakespeare's Twelfth Night suggests that while masquerade can be a tool for deceit over extended periods, it ultimately requires shedding the disguise to prevent self-forgetfulness. Disclosing the truth, however, poses challenges such as potential estrangement. The decision then lies between self-preservation and the maintenance of relationships. While some may accept the ruse, others may be offended.\n\nThe theme of deception in gender reversal, particularly Viola's case, raises significant concerns, namely the motive behind one's assumption of an opposite gender identity. Viola, a newcomer in a strange land, adopts a male guise for protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249). Her scheme succeeds but distances her from female companions, denying her important support. Moreover, her convincing portrayal leads Olivia to confuse her with her twin brother Sebastian, resulting in romantic entanglements: “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138). Additionally, she faces suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nViewed through a modern lens, this might be seen as an exploration of how deception can unveil hidden emotions, particularly for Olivia and Orsino. Some passages suggest these characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires invoked by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario due to his male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? One might argue Olivia's behavior suggests she is merely reflecting the societal judgments of her time. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)",
            "The sharp criticisms aimed at German colonial rule, especially its harsh treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa, are well-documented. Yet, reducing the colonial enterprise to such stark terms would disregard the heterogeneity of imperial governance and educational initiatives. The German colonial empire varied widely across its territories, exhibiting diverse ruling styles and educational systems. Upon assuming control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British encountered a considerable population of literate Africans, a testament to German educational endeavors in the region. However, the scenario in South West Africa (now Namibia) presented a markedly different picture. Unlike in East Africa, where the government actively participated in native education, the task of educating the indigenous population in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary societies with limited state support. Notably, the German government invested heavily in the education of European settlers, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support to missionary schools for settlers. This educational disparity left a lasting impact on South West Africa, even after the end of German rule. While other German colonies boasted literate African populations, in South West Africa, \"the vast majority remained uneducated and illiterate,\" due to a combination of social, political, and economic factors. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly focusing on recent research into the mindsets of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThere is a plethora of literature on education within the German colonial empire, much of it written in German and emerging during or immediately after the colonial period. These early works primarily aimed to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Later works in English broadened the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects. These studies revealed significant variations in educational systems among different colonies. The most relevant to this paper is Cohen's comparison of educational systems in South West Africa and East Africa, which discusses factors contributing to their differences. Cohen attributes many unique features of South West Africa's educational system to its substantial settler population.\n\nSouth West Africa, with a moderately temperate climate, was more favorable to European settlement compared to other German colonies, although much of the territory is arid. By 1913, South West Africa had nearly 15,000 European settlers, in contrast to the 5,336 in East Africa, the next largest settler colony.",
            "The evolution of Popular Music has witnessed an expansive growth over the last century, encompassing an array of genres that amass a vast landscape. The challenge lies in attempting to enumerate all the genres, as each—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk—has propagated numerous sub- and sub-sub-genres. Notably, the sub-genre Heavy Metal rock has demonstrated remarkable diversity and emotional range over the past four decades. It is characterized by a broad spectrum of emotions, predominantly on the darker side. This diversity stems from the early recognition of Heavy Metal's flexibility, leading to the creation of unique sub-genres, which, in turn, birthed sub-sub-genres, continuing to this day.\n\nThe Heavy Metal movement today is so fragmented that it is difficult to pinpoint its core essence. It has assimilated themes from various genres, yet traces its origins to a specific starting point. To grasp the contemporary Heavy Metal music, one must first understand the movement's definition and its status as a movement rather than a mere genre.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be deemed the \"music of more\"—more bass, volume, aggression, and theatricality. Unlike its predecessors, Metal bands exhibit exceptional instrumental prowess. Moreover, the movement has been deeply entwined with drug culture, with the mid-70s psychedelic boom significantly influencing its evolution and sonic exploration. This association with drugs facilitated the creation of otherworldly recordings, often serving as a catalyst for the exploration of dark, visceral qualities, which were relatively untapped by mainstream popular music at the time. Furthermore, later generations of Metal have drawn inspiration from the dark, emotional depth of the Romantic era. Lyrics such as those from Helter Skelter by the Beatles exemplify this darker side, reflecting a journey through highs and lows, often attributed to drug influences. This song, considered one of the first Heavy Metal tracks, served as a response to The Rolling Stones' heavier, darker tracks, demonstrating the Beatles' desire to match their intensity.",
            "Years prior to the inception of dreamlike works by Surrealist artists, Henri Rousseau was diligently weaving his own reveries, both literal and metaphorical. In 'The Dream,' a 1910 masterpiece by the renowned Post-Impressionist, we witness not merely a woman captivated by a landscaped dream, but also Rousseau’s own aspirations and internal conflict as a painter. Since embarking on his artistic journey, he harbored dreams of acceptance, admiration, and acclaim from peers and connoisseurs alike, grappling with the conundrum of either conforming to or emulating established painting styles for validation, or forging his own path, thus showcasing his unique creativity.\n\nTo fully understand 'The Dream' through this lens, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau’s life story. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a French town in the northwest, his father was a tinsmith and hardware merchant who enjoyed a comfortable living. Lacking formal art training, Rousseau was employed as a gabelou until the age of forty, working for France's municipal toll service, earning the moniker 'douanier' or customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children left him with only his daughter, Julia, and profound sadness, pushing him to turn to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike peers who romanticized the peasant in art, Rousseau was a folk painter, his dreams reflecting those of the average working class.\n\nRousseau’s longing for acceptance in the art world becomes more palpable when considering his background: he was untrained, began late in life, and was active contemporaneously with esteemed artists. Recognition for his work, however, came around the same time Matisse was gaining prominence. In 'Modern French Painters,' author Jan Gordon notes that while both were competitors, they differed in style, subject matter, and motivation: “Matisse painted to avoid triviality, while Rousseau sought to create conventional art to gain admission to the Artiste Français” (92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous intellects have contended that a profound bond exists between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I concur with this notion at a foundational level. John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", aptly captures this sentiment: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty — that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The knowledge we acquire in life primarily comes through formal education or life experiences. Yet, we seem to grasp the essence of ethics and aesthetics intuitively, as Keats suggests, without needing formal instruction. Both fields strive to elucidate rather than dictate. We delve into the reasons behind a piece's artistry or moral merit, rather than establish rules for creating or evaluating such works.\n\nCritiques of art or morality often fall short of encapsulating the true nature of goodness or beauty. A discussion on the Mona Lisa's value might revolve around elements like perspective, composition, or cultural significance, but these fail to encapsulate why it's considered great art. More often than not, responses to a favorite work of art or literature begin with an enigmatic, inexplicable phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more detailed explanation. This implies that both art and morality possess an ineffable quality that transcends description. As Flannery O'Connor asserts, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, morality and ethics, despite our best efforts, cannot be fully articulated.\n\nThis ineffable quality, often referred to as \"je ne sais quoi,\" is their most potent attribute. It is this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics that binds them together. I believe that both fields impact us at a level that is felt but not fully comprehended, a notion echoed by Immanuel Kant's concept of the \"noumenal.\" This connection is especially strong in literature, as McKean posits, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is unique about the art, is its moral quality. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\" Thus, I propose that this shared transcendental nature of ethics and aesthetics is what forges their deep connection.",
            "The contemporary Germany stands as a powerful entity, an amalgamation of cultural tapestries that unfurl from the alpine cradle of Munich to the Baltic seashore of Kiel. This cultural mosaic is evident from Cologne's riverine location, weaving through the nation's heart, and concluding in the Elbe-side city of Dresden in Saxony. Given this rich cultural blend, it is no surprise that the Germany we know today is a synthesis of diverse origins and tribal influences.\n\nThe ancestral home of the Germans, Germania, the etymology of its name remains a subject of scholarly debate. Some attribute the name to a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who were known as such before crossing the Rhine to face the Gallic forces (Tacitus, 98). Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic War, initially used the term \"Germanus\" to delineate between the conquered Gauls and the Germanic tribes that often crossed the Rhine (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). The origin of the name remains uncertain, with some suggesting it derived from the Gallic word for neighbor, while others propose it comes from the old Anglo-Saxon term for spear, \"ger,\" or the Old Irish \"garim\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' reputation for loudness (Names of Germany).\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous to the region, untouched by foreign immigration or contact. He posed the question, \"Who would abandon a comfortable life in Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its harsh terrain, gloomy skies, and grim demeanor?\" (Tacitus, 98). The Romans, for their part, rarely ventured into Germania, preferring instead to lead occasional campaigns and trade goods and skills acquired from the region. Thus, as Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they remained on the empire's borders, trading their produce and military skills with the Romans (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I gazed vacantly at the tableau before me, a blank slate. Impartially, steadfast, my consciousness parsed the image without attachment to any abstract concepts. Ideas flitted through my mind like leaves in a breeze, appearing and disappearing in an instant. My mind was a conduit, not a creator. At some point, I procured an instructional volume called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" seeking to learn the art of drawing since my childhood. It offers insights into the mind's processes when interpreting lines and brushstrokes. One method it suggests is to impose a square frame around an image to simplify the scene. Yet, when I stood before the bowl of fruit and the expansive kitchen, I could not frame it as the artist's manual advised. I was paralyzed by awe, the masterpieces of Picasso and Monet dancing in my mind's eye. It was the genesis of my own artistic exploration, the inception of \"Work in Brown.\" My fingers danced with the brush, my muscles tensed and released, my intent taking form. The water was serene, clear, and clean. Matter broke away, swallowed by the void. My hand struck the toilet handle again, my second attempt more urgent. The offending package remained stubborn. I held the mop loosely, feet planted, tie knotted around my neck, my brow furrowed as I stared at the unwanted deposit. A few more flushes, a few more moments of reflection, and my hand reached for the wall, grabbing the toilet paper, wrapping it around my glove like a glove. Standing tall, then bent at the waist, my hand dipped into the bowl, a mother's gentle hand reaching into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "Young adults often meet tragic ends behind the wheel. A convergence of several factors leads to this grim statistical trend for the youngest American drivers. According to the National Institutes of Health, one aspect of the issue is that the immature adolescent brain is not yet equipped to handle the perils of driving. Additionally, their lack of experience is a significant contributor to this problem. This inexperience not only increases the likelihood of fatal accidents but also leads to more rollovers, speeding incidents, and driving off the road. Teenagers, predictably, are more frequently accompanied by peers, which is known to be a norm. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a notable correlation between the age of the passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. Many states, including California, have implemented temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours teens can drive and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely stopgap solutions. The core issue is that, collectively, the youngest drivers are statistically unable to manage the associated risks and responsibilities. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman argues that even 18 years of age might be too young for a regular driver's license. USA Today reports Zuckerman's findings that individuals under 19 or 20 often crave thrill-seeking experiences. Thus, delaying driving until these tendencies subside seems sensible. If we persist in issuing driver's licenses to young teens, we may witness an escalation in fatal accidents, with the death toll potentially reaching alarming proportions in the coming years. The Baby Boomers' children will soon become eligible to drive, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads. Legislation addressing this concern could be relatively straightforward. Educational institutions could continue to teach driver's education, with no one under 18 allowed to drive a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued, followed by a full driver's license after a certain number of hours of practical training. The specific number of hours required could mirror the majority of states' current standards (for example, California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult). Given the national scope of teenage driver fatalities, unified, nationwide legislation on this issue would be sensible and potentially effective in safeguarding teens across the country. This proposed legislation is not an unprecedented idea.",
            "While perusing the Library of Congress's collection of vintage Edison films, I decided to examine all 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films typically employ creative editing to create illusions. My analysis mainly focused on describing the poetic elements prevalent in most trick films and exploring the unique characteristics of certain later films. Around the turn of the century, trick films were primarily confined within a stage-like setting, using a frontal proscenium with no camera movement. They typically employed long and medium shots, adhering to the single shot per film rule. However, some films in the early 1900s defied these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne common trait of trick films is their filming within a static frame, reminiscent of early theatre and vaudeville stages. The camera remains stationary, allowing figures and objects to move horizontally but rarely approach or recede from the lens. For instance, in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), actors enter from the right and move back and forth, but the camera doesn't track their movements. Similarly, shots are usually long or medium, with close-ups being absent, mirroring the theatre tradition where the audience views the entire performance within the stage's frame.\n\nMost early trick films operate under the principle that one conceptual shot equals one film, limiting their length to about a minute or less. This practice also restricts their dramatic or narrative potential, with most films presenting brief, vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, in trick films, a single conceptual shot often consists of multiple physical shots joined together to create illusions, such as apparitions or vanishings. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, illustrates this practice, where the headless Mary's physical shot begins midway through the film, despite appearing as one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and zealous advocate for Republican ideals. While he was primarily an agrarian, his foray into politics shaped him into a steadfast champion of personal liberties and governance. His commitment to an agrarian society underpinned his views on sovereignty, constitutional law, and even the judiciary. His dedication to preserving and promoting agriculture as the most superior profession influenced his arguments on these matters.\n\nTaylor held that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an ideal governance system, as there were no entrenched traditions to impede this process. He firmly believed in the interdependence of natural human rights and that they should be impervious to government intervention. He argued that, in the absence of civilization, the strong and cunning would thrive, but in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must acknowledge the inherent goodness and evil within people. He maintained a rigid dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is wielded by men, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" (Ibid., pg. 167) He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism. He believed that a government rooted in these principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be led by self-interest. He viewed self-interest as a natural human trait, but considered it evil when it led to sub-societies that exploited others. A good government was essential to control man's inherent evil, but it must be vigilantly watched to prevent the infiltration of bad principles.\n\nLike many of his contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimal Federal government, with no additional rights or powers than those explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could be costly and potentially despotic. However, he believed that a literal interpretation could be corrupt if not guided by the intent of the Constitution's framers. Furthermore, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly describes the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting Figure 17, a marked decline in commuter log submissions was observed in the third month. This prompted concerns about the potential causes. The arrival of winter at a New England campus could account for some of this drop, as commuting by bicycle or foot may have decreased. Additionally, December marks the end of the academic term, with students and faculty busied by end-of-semester tasks. The commuter log may have been overshadowed by these priorities. Furthermore, December's holiday season brings a temporary campus hiatus, further reducing the need to commute. The low February submissions remain unexplained. It's possible that projects like these experience an initial enthusiasm followed by a natural decline. To counter this, the Carpool Challenge Week, a March campaign, was introduced, which resulted in increased submissions. Maintaining project momentum, especially during holidays and semester breaks, was a significant challenge. Another hurdle was the cultural preference for driving, necessitating incentives for alternative commuting. Various prizes, including gift cards, were offered. While these were deemed sufficient initially, larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have further boosted participation. Varying prize values over time might have also helped.",
            "ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are financial instruments that aim to mirror indexes, commodities, or a selection of assets, much like index funds, but trade like stocks on exchanges. They offer diversification akin to index funds, along with the perks of stock ownership, such as short selling, margin buying, and single share transactions. Despite their appeal, ETFs charge lower fees compared to typical mutual funds. However, they incur trade commissions, similar to stock orders. The array of ETF options is broad, but it's prudent for astute investors to scrutinize these claims, especially diversification's extent. We'll examine ETF IHF and its top ten holdings, representing 63.58% of its assets, to gauge if owning the ETF matches the benefits of owning individual stocks, and if there are superior configurations for better performance.\n\nTo simplify, we'll focus on these top ten holdings. We'll assess their representativeness of the ETF by calculating their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Returns, assuming the portfolio mirrors the ETF's asset distribution. From these calculations, a portfolio of the top ten holdings yields a 6.11% higher return with a lower Beta of 0.12 compared to the ETF. This suggests a portfolio of these top stocks could offer higher returns and lower risk. However, statistical significance isn't guaranteed.\n\nTo evaluate if these portfolios differ significantly, we'll determine the standard deviation of each top ten stock and normalize it to 100% for a comparison with the ETF IHF's total standard deviation.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is frequently cited as one of his more notable compositions. Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" in verses 6 and 56, a term traceable to Virgil's works. Virgil referenced Thulé as an island situated beyond the northern reaches of Britain, considered the boundary of known lands by the Greeks. Although Virgil's usage is undeniable, there's a more contemporary reference that merits attention. Poe had a strong affinity for German literature.\n\nThis use of \"Thulé\" carries significance as it demonstrates Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt's book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" delves into the similarities between the two poets' works, concluding that Poe was likely imitating Goethe. Goethe, renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published the first part in 1808 and the second part upon his death in 1832. Within the second part lies a poem entitled \"The King of Thulé,\" chronicling a king who, after his wife's death, descends into alcoholism and despair, ultimately taking his own life. The similarities between the king and the description in \"Dream-Land\" are striking, mirroring Poe's own struggles with loss and addiction.\n\nPoe's usage of \"Thulé\" extends beyond \"Dream-Land.\" In \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the phrase \"ultma Thulé,\" suggesting a connection to \"The King of Thulé.\" \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" can be viewed as complementary works. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker's description of Thulé—a dark, lonely landscape haunted by friends—echoes the melancholic state of the king in Goethe's poem. This parallelism suggests that Poe may have stepped into the narrative of \"The King of Thulé,\" mirroring his own emotional turmoil. Goethe's influence on Poe is further underscored by his reputation and connections to other notable figures like Tennyson, whose works Poe admired and whose circle he would have encountered.",
            "In California, could an individual who suffered harm after slipping in a grocery store on spilled applesauce be awarded punitive damages, based on the store manager's awareness of past incidents and their inaction? A judge would likely not dismiss such a claim immediately. To claim punitive damages, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's actions were willfully and consciously disregarding probable harm, and that the conduct was despicable. In this case, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, could argue that the store manager, Paul Martin, should have known the potential harm of leaving the spill uncleaned, given the repeated incidents of customers slipping earlier. Although her argument about despicable conduct may not be strongest, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents in 2009 and the manager's lack of response. On October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, informed Martin of the spill, but he was on dinner break and declined to address it. Another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, reported the spill at 5:15 pm, but Martin again refused to act. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell, resulting in a serious back injury. By this time, five such incidents had already occurred that year. Palmer is now suing D&D for damages, and we are considering a motion for partial summary on the punitive damage claim. In California, punitive damages can be awarded for non-contractual breaches if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). Malice is defined as conduct intended to cause harm or, if no intent, conduct that is despicable and committed with a willful disregard for others' safety. Courts have considered conduct malicious when the defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Back in 2019, I engaged in an educational exploration of Islam through a course at the Community Bible Church. The central debate that stirred our class was the nature of Islam, specifically if it was inherently antagonistic. This query feels even more pertinent today than it did at that time. Recall the seismic shifts in public perception of Islam and extremist groups post-9/11. The pendulum swung from a hostile stance to a nearly idolatrous tolerance. The notion of a president with the surname \"Obama\" being elected, with his familial roots in Islam, would have been unimaginable in 2001.\n\nThe life of the Prophet, as depicted in his biography, presents an intriguing conundrum. My understanding of historical Muhammad led me to believe he imposed Islam upon conquered tribes, yet the narrative paints him as a martyr, humbled and misunderstood. This portrayal leads people to seek out and embrace Islam on their own accord. I find a striking parallel between the ministries of Jesus and the miracles attributed to Muhammad. For instance, Muhammad's multiplication of sheep and milk to feed forty men echoes Jesus's feeding of the five thousand. This style of storytelling suggests Muhammad was divinely guided, not requiring validation through miracles, but merely embodying truth and wonder. This approach diminishes Jesus’s unique significance.\n\nMoreover, many accounts in the biography feel contrived, aiming to substantiate witnesses or conversions independently. However, these stories are often filtered through multiple layers of hearsay, diminishing their credibility. I find it problematic that the biography elevates Muhammad as a paragon of godliness, humility, wisdom, and gentleness, which contradicts historical accounts of his conquests and rule.\n\nThis approach bothers me deeply. If Muslims are aware of the historical Muhammad, the true history behind his rise to power and subsequent rule, it may challenge the revered image of him as a gentle, humble leader.",
            "The tenets expounded by Jesus during his tenure and the subsequent beliefs that emerged post-mortem, have evolved over time, shifting Christianity's trajectory away from its genesis. Observing this trajectory through a wide lens reveals a pattern of gradual deviation. Today's society demonstrates a heightened consciousness and an unprecedented inclination towards progress. While conservative factions persist, their impact on the whole is often negligible. Among Christians, historical awareness will burgeon in the coming years. A desire will spread, to differentiate the doctrines appended to Christianity over time from its original intent. This shift, though gradual, is inevitable: Christianity will revert to its essence, stripping away accumulated layers of doctrine, as if the clock is rewound. This reversion, sweeping through the United States and Europe, will inspire a new wave of adherents to worship as they did during Jesus' time, guided solely by his teachings. While the church's institutional strength will remain, the theological clock's backward movement will unify beliefs and practices, reducing diversity. This phenomenon is not unprecedented; history abounds with such reversals. For instance, Christianity once faced persecution under the Roman Empire, which later became a bastion of Christianity. The same country that once practiced African-American slavery now boasts African-American leadership. The Christian religion's future reversion will reverberate similarly, undoing history in its pursuit of authenticity and minimizing diversity. This process hinges on interpreting Jesus' words metaphorically, not literally. So, what transpired post-Jesus' life?\n\nRetracing history, we find Judaism, Christianity's theological forebear, at its core. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the supremacy of Hebrew scriptures were entrenched by the time Rome seized Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish populace was not unified; they were divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the general population.",
            "I contend that Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" illustrates the innate avarice and egoism within human nature. Individuals are inherently driven to prioritize their own interests and well-being, disregarding those beneath them. The novel underscores this theme through various examples. One prominent instance involves the proprietors and overseers of the colossal factories. Their singular objective is to maximize their enterprises, without concern for any obstacle or consequence. Sinclair vividly depicts the environmental fallout, as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery highlights the owners' disregard for potential victims, both human and animal. They remain unperturbed by the factory's toxic emissions or the fetid waste runoff from the extensive pens surrounding Packingtown. The workers, too, are exploited, with their labor exploited to increase profits. The text notes, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\" Workers are subjected to grueling hours and sudden mass layoffs without compensation or job assistance. In this time, scant regulations safeguarded workers' safety or welfare, allowing managers and owners to operate unchecked. The rigors of the system were such that those who perished in Packingtown were expected to endure the harsh conditions both within the factories and in their surroundings. No entities existed to aid workers, and while unions were formed, they frequently exacerbated the plight of their members. The workers, trapped in this system, were likened to slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers.\"",
            "Authors, in their literary endeavors, often employ various methods to evoke specific sentiments or viewpoints regarding pivotal subjects. Some of these strategies are more successful than others. In his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous techniques to achieve this. He often combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to create an atmosphere around a subject. At times, he imbues symbols with meaning and uses them for the same purpose. Fitzgerald utilizes this latter technique extensively, particularly with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald assigns significance to these colors and later employs them to convey feelings associated with important objects.\n\nThe meaning Fitzgerald ascribes to white/gray is uniformity, with white representing a higher, more refined status and gray signifying older, faded elements. He establishes this significance early in the novel, using both colors repeatedly. Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted in white—Daisy in particular, as seen when she is “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster” (74). Similarly, characters like Nick, Tom, and Catherine are often dressed in white, such as Nick’s “white flannels” (41) at Gatsby’s party or Tom’s “white shirt” (36) during his encounter with Myrtle. The only time white is not predominant is when Nick describes Gatsby’s party as having “gaudy primary colors” (40). Additionally, Fitzgerald uses white/gray to color ordinary subjects: Nick's commute takes him “down the white chasms of lower New York” (56), and the names on his party guest list are “gray” (61). The valley of ashes is filled with “gray cars” (23) and “gray land” (23), and even the dog-seller is a “gray old man” (27). After investing these colors with meaning, Fitzgerald employs them to signify unimportance or uniformity, beginning with Daisy. After a prolonged period without their use, Daisy is described as “dressed in white” in a “little white roadster,” portraying her more as a uniform addition rather than a character. This technique is further applied to Daisy, as seen in her “gray haze of fur collar” (18) and another white dress (115), emphasizing her role as an object of desire rather than a distinct individual.",
            "San Diego County stands out for its agricultural prowess, largely due to its temperate and sun-drenched climate. Staple crops encompass tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. A thriving demand exists for organic community-supported agriculture in the San Diego region, with numerous local groups boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms extend tours of their operations and offer recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This setup allows landowners to capitalize on government programs while enhancing habitats for recreation and educational purposes.\n\nOrganic farming, while filling a profitable niche market, is accompanied by increased costs and labor demands. It requires meticulous manual management to control pests and weeds, and lacking chemical assistance, soil fertilization becomes more labor-intensive. Consequently, organic farming often experiences higher losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, small-scale organic farms lack the operational efficiency of larger entities. Benefits not directly linked to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, controlling invasive species, and manipulating plant growth to create specific habitats, can also add to labor costs.\n\nThe selected parcel, located near Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is a 160-acre expanse of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. It falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, currently recognizing over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, like the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and certain butterfly species. Others, such as the California gnatcatcher, are on the verge of listing due to declining populations.\n\nHistorically, this land was inhabited by Native Americans for millennia, later settled by cattle ranchers and lumber operators in the late 1800s. As part of an original homestead patent, the land was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years. An examination of real estate listings led to the selection of this property for further research into available government programs. As a hypothetical model for farming this land, I identified a nearby organic farm.",
            "Cultural dynamics significantly influence the negotiation process. Culture can be viewed not only by what it embodies but also by what it eschews, and the meanings it conveys. It is not a monolithic entity, nor is it singular or standardized. Propositions such as \"all Russians are rigid\" or \"all Japanese are adaptable\" are oversimplifications. While recognizing the broad strokes of a culture is beneficial, a successful negotiator should delve into the nuances of how a culture's attitudes can shape the negotiation dynamics at hand. When engaging with an unfamiliar culture, it is natural to draw comparisons based on one's own cultural lens, but it is crucial to understand that these comparisons may not always hold true.\n\nGrasping a foreign culture or mindset can involve various approaches, from historical study to acknowledging its biases. Rather than passing judgment or attempting to alter a culture, one must recognize and respect its inherent values and work within its parameters, especially in negotiations where a weaker bargaining position exists. In a foreign environment, respect for established norms and beliefs can help overcome cultural obstacles and propel the negotiation process forward.\n\nCulture isn't confined to national or international boundaries. Organizational cultures within a nation, such as corporate cultures, can greatly vary. These can reflect differences in work schedules, dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. For example, some companies might prioritize long office hours, while others advocate for a more flexible schedule. A company's philanthropic policies can also reflect its cultural values, ranging from encouraging employee-led initiatives to restricting charitable activities to authorized causes. Differences in American corporate cultures, even within the same organization, can demonstrate the diversity of thought within a single societal culture. Some cultures may appear more homogenous to outsiders, but a deeper examination reveals similar complexities.\n\nValues are particularly important in understanding a culture, as they provide the underlying motivations. If saving face or group harmony are valued, a negotiator will not publically humiliate their company or superiors to achieve a deal. Conversely, a negotiator from a culture emphasizing hard bargains may not be as eager to settle early. Acknowledging these cultural nuances before the negotiation commences can be advantageous, but understanding the individual aspects of the opposing party can further enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "\"One said aloud, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase first appears in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and was employed by St. Anselm when he sought to prove God's existence. This stance is echoed by Thomas Aquinas, who also advocates for God's existence. To compare their arguments, we must assume they both believe in the same deity, the one described in biblical texts. However, neither argument provides a comprehensive foundation for faith in God.\n\nExamining St. Anselm's argument reveals a path of understanding through personal belief. He posits that one can find proof of God's existence within their own comprehension. While his logic is complex, it boils down to the idea that believing in God is inherent in our understanding and does not require external evidence. This concept is akin to faith, a central tenet in Christianity.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes that God's existence can be demonstrated through reason and empirical evidence, negating the need for faith. This approach could aid in converting new believers, as it relies solely on logical persuasion. Aquinas presents five arguments supporting God's existence: change, cause, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. He argues that the need for a logical necessity for God can be deduced without direct observation, much like knowing the features of a missing puzzle piece from the rest.",
            "In the distant epochs of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a future sage, eventually known as the Buddha, entered the world. His life's journey encompassed an ascetic's renouncement and eventual enlightenment, giving birth to Buddhism, a faith now recognized as the most traditional form, known as Theravada. The religion has persisted for nearly 2,500 years, evolving markedly different from its original manifestation. This transformation is readily evident in nations such as Sri Lanka, where a peculiar ceremony, the water-cutting ritual, is annually observed. Both Buddhist monks and laypeople participate, despite the Buddha's teachings never having included this celebration. From the surface level of traditions to the core principles of salvation, the Theravada Buddhist community has necessarily adapted over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, some hostile and others benign.\n\nThroughout this discourse, several key terminologies will be frequently employed. The terms 'internal' and 'external' refer to influences originating from within and outside the Buddhist community, respectively. A 'hostile' force is any factor that harms or seeks to harm the Buddhist community due to a negative perception of it. Conversely, a 'benign' force is one that does not intend to cause harm but may inadvertently do so.\n\nFirstly, a foundational understanding of Theravada Buddhism's core tenets is essential. Buddhists take refuge in the 'Three Jewels': the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka, or 'three baskets' of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles can lead to the cessation of Sansara, the cycle of birth and rebirth, and consequently, the end of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for laypeople and monks alike, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not consume intoxicants), while monks follow a more extensive set of rules. The fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths, acknowledging the existence of suffering (Dukkha), its cause (attachment), and the possibility of its cessation.",
            "The United States and Mexico once engaged in a protracted rivalry that endured for 57 years, from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War in 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious and annexed Texas and the American Southwest. Besides this major conflict, several other skirmishes occurred between the two nations until the dawn of the First World War. The rivalry was fueled by key issues such as religion, culture, and vital material interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis dynamic is not unique to the United States and Mexico. Border-sharing nations often develop rivalries due to conflicting interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) observes that only Mexico and Cuba have enduring diplomatic tensions with the United States (p. 41). Geographical proximity and historical rivalries contribute to these tensions, which do not typically characterize other Latin American nations' relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences further strained the relationship between the two nations, mirroring historical patterns of ideological clashes. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that Americans historically opposed certain ideologies, including Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86). The rivalry between the United States and Mexico, though not a direct ideological struggle, was rooted in religious preferences and the lingering distrust stemming from the English and Spanish colonial past.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 disputes during the 57-year rivalry, most of which were territorial in nature. Border raids and frontier issues were significant problems that persisted until both countries applied military force to their borders (Schmitt 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became more dependent on the United States, and it effectively ended when American interests shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, I was unexpectedly struck down by an ailment I had never known. At that time, I was a healthcare provider, a choice born out of a profound longing for the steadfastness and stability I did not experience in my youth. The refrain \"you'll always have a job, people get sick\" echoed through my adolescence and beyond, influencing my career path. Though my aspirations leaned towards science or journalism, preferably a blend of both, nursing seemed like a more practical, secure choice.\n\nHowever, here I am: nearing fifty, unmarried, financially strapped, and unable to work. After fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I've lost every material possession, save for the minimal essentials. Each day is a battle, a relentless onslaught on my security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing in my life is certain, yet one truth remains undeniable: I could not have persevered for this long without the support of my family and a handful of devoted friends. When life's crises hit, one's resilience falters, leaving them feeling disarmed.\n\nMy message is simple: life's emergencies, both large and small, are inevitable. There are no assurances, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges are insurmountable alone.\n\nI acknowledge the need for Americans to stop relying solely on government solutions. We must foster trust in one another, learn to assist and seek assistance, rather than each person isolating themselves in their own survival plans. Our forefathers' resilience during challenging times was not a result of rugged individualism; it was compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that sustained them. The pioneers who traversed the Rockies in covered wagons did not make it to the coast by themselves.\n\nTherefore, be prepared. I am. My emergency kit includes first aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting, duct tape for window sealing, flashlights, batteries, candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and the resources, cultivating a small farm and preserving your own food is a commendable endeavor, as is acquiring a wood stove, provided you don't reside in an apartment.\n\nBut as you stock up, also get to know your neighbors.",
            "The question of how organisms adapt and change over time is as pertinent today as it was in 1917 when D'Arcy Thompson mused that zoologists had yet to begin defining organic forms in mathematical terms. Recent advancements in mathematical modeling, however, have provided insights into the processes underlying evolutionary transformations. Our current investigation delves into how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic changes in Prunum, combined with empirical studies, can reveal the mechanisms driving the magnitude and direction of evolutionary-developmental shifts. Utilizing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantifiable parameters that were subsequently employed in the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995) to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These models serve as a framework for interpreting the limits of possible morphological changes within Prunum, with results being integrated with experimental and descriptive research to illuminate macroevolutionary events in this group.\n\nThe growth of a shell can be visualized as a continuous structure extending along a 360-degree path through space and time. Each loop or turn in this path, known as a whorl, spirals around an imaginary central axis called the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand varies, and the line connecting them is termed a suture. Typically, the largest whorl, termed the body whorl, is the final one, with the remainder constituting the spire. The apex and base of the shell are the top and bottom points, respectively, while the aperture is the opening through which the animal extends.\n\nShells can be observed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The common orientation, or apertural view, shows the aperture facing the viewer with the apex pointing upward. A method for counting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical position and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell, with whorls counted from this point, estimated to a quarter whorl.\n\nShells can be perceived as a series of apertures that evolve through time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The trajectory of these apertures can be tracked using the coordinates of each whorl’s aperture and the horizontal and vertical radii. Mathematically representing this trajectory allows for parameter adjustments and modifications in mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, the statistics of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have been relatively unchanged. While the nation is on course to achieve many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as those concerning water and sanitation, the progress in child and maternal health lags significantly behind the targets set for 2015. The underlying causes of these shortcomings will be examined, revealing a need to bolster the healthcare system rather than concentrate solely on specific interventions.\n\nThe percentage of births attended by skilled healthcare workers has improved, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot handle complex medical situations, leading to high maternal mortality rates due to complications like hemorrhage. Thus, the advancements in this indicator are somewhat deceptive, and much remains to be done. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in the proportion of diarrhea cases treated by healthcare professionals in children under five years old. Additionally, data on postnatal care is incomplete but indicates this area is a concern, with low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates are lower than expected, at about 4%. The urban c-section rate of 7% contrasts with the rural rate of 2%, highlighting inequity in healthcare access. Urban areas have better service coverage, while the poorest quintile faces a 27% gap in service utilization due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering steps to enhance neonatal and maternal health indicators, the fundamental question is how best to address the lack of service provision. Should Indonesia focus on developing targeted program-specific approaches, or should it prioritize strengthening the overall healthcare system without concentrating on pre- and postnatal care for mothers and children? Programmatic approaches are undeniably attractive, with their clear, manageable objectives and faster results. However, they also have drawbacks. Overinvestment in one sector can lead to reduced funding for others and draw human resources away from other areas, as demonstrated by the impact of international HIV/AIDS funding on family planning. Moreover, running multiple, uncoordinated parallel programs can result in duplicated services and increased paperwork.",
            "Victorian literature is renowned for its meticulous attention to detail and concentration on the upper classes of the era. Two works that deviate from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These novels incorporate an element of enigma and a penchant for the unusual, which is atypical of the period, thereby enriching the characters and offering deeper insights into their motivations and sentiments. Dickens' narrative employs a dream sequence to illustrate Oliver's inner turmoil and his struggle with the shooting event. In this passage, Oliver's lack of control over the happenings is highlighted, as he is helplessly carried away by an unseen force. The shooting is depicted as a recurring nightmare, with Oliver's senses dulled and his desperation evident. This sequence reinforces the idea that external forces dictate Oliver's fate, as he is unable to exert any control over his life. Moreover, it suggests a growing sense of resignation and defeat, as if Oliver is being broken by the circumstances, rendering him incapable of reacting.\n\n“And now, a multitude of bewildering and perplexing thoughts came flooding into his mind. He seemed to be still walking alongside Sikes and Crackit, who were heatedly arguing: for the very words they uttered, echoed in his ears; and when he attempted to focus his thoughts, … he realized that he was conversing with them…. Suddenly, he startled at the sound of gunfire; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights flickered before his eyes, and all was chaos and tumult, as some unperceived hand bore him swiftly away. Throughout these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy awareness of pain, which wore and tormented him continuously.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThe two novels frequently utilize this mystery through dreamlike sequences, yet the content and purpose vary in each specific instance. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often reveal insights into Oliver's inner self, his burdens, and his understanding of the true nature of the events unfolding around him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the experience as if in a dream, while struggling to seek help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events, as well as the dire straits his health has fallen into, evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, his senses numbed as he fails to notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; his despair is revisited, removed from the initial shock of pain, now constant and associated with fear rather than surprise. Oliver's helplessness in the face of danger is emphasized, as he is unable to make any attempt to gain control over the situation. Furthermore, a sense of defeat is implied, as if old Fagin's influence has begun to wear him down, forcing him to accept this despair and influencing his ability to react. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have tried to make some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day passed – day? There was no such thing; it was gone as quickly as it had come – and night returned again; night so long, yet so brief; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.”",
            "Two years ago, I worked in an after-school program, assisting elementary-aged students with various subjects. My proficiency in English and reading was particularly advantageous, but I was tasked with aiding a young boy named Adrian, who faced substantial difficulties in reading. The strangeness of his struggles was palpable—he could accurately pronounce some letters, while others were mispronounced, which was bewildering. Adrian spoke English flawlessly, yet the language barrier was undeniable. A breakthrough occurred when I met his mother during a babysitting session. She communicated exclusively in Spanish, and despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to convey essential information. It became evident that Adrian's reading problem stemmed from a poor understanding of the English alphabet, not his reading capabilities. I hope his situation improved since then.\n\nThis anecdote underscores the challenges posed by the language barrier in educational settings, especially in California. Sometimes, issues are not as apparent as they seem. Even proficient English speakers can struggle with reading. Addressing this problem requires a multi-faceted approach. In Adrian's case, targeted tutoring in English reading, particularly the alphabet and pronunciation, was effective. However, for children who speak minimal English, the solution is far more intricate. No single method will suffice; the solution lies in integrating various approaches.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system holds promise. It benefits not only Spanish-speaking students but all students. Research indicates that children in two-way bilingual programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and its perceived ineffectiveness, a widespread implementation could benefit all students. To achieve this, we should not mandate that all teachers be bilingual, but rather incorporate bilingual aides and tutors to support the dual language system.",
            "From a tender age, we're often taught there's something greater than ourselves, an entity or force beyond our grasp. Some find solace in organized religion, while others delve deep within themselves for answers. Many adhere to the faith of their upbringing, while a few vehemently reject it, believing only in their personal worldview. Our spiritual journeys often shape our identities, guiding us through the darkest nights towards the light.\n\nWhen I inquired about his favorite bird, my father replied, \"A cardinal.\" We sat on the porch, the rain drumming overhead as our cigarettes smoked beside us. The gutters channeled the rain, inundating the plants near the edge. He gazed into the rain, his eyes reflecting a mix of reminiscence and search. His once full form had thinned, and his hair had receded. He stared silently into the rain, avoiding my gaze. His presence made me feel isolated, fearful, and unable to express my fears. I embraced him, sat closer, and joined him in watching the rain-kissed twilight.\n\nMy father passed away in December, five days after my birthday. The treatments prolonged his suffering, but also extended his life beyond predictions. The purpose of his prolonged agony eluded me. I questioned the existence of God, feeling abandoned. I chose not to witness his passing, preferring to remember him through his vibrant life, not his final moments. Alone in my bed, I hid for three days, awaiting the news.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" a blend of the old and new, a term coined by Ian Watt, is marked by both admiration and derision. It's been lauded for its 'terrible sublime' and dismissed for a lack of depth. The inaugural 'Gothic Novel,' Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" fused \"ancient\" and \"modern\" elements, birthing a new literary format. Walpole's work integrated \"old\" theatrical elements and a \"new\" natural mimicry, presenting a \"Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre, steeped in medieval theatre, architecture, and customs, was perceived as antiquated, contrasting with \"modern\" advancements. The fusion of theatrical \"Gothic\" and the personal novel narrative allows Gothic to endure and resonate across time. One enduring theme in Gothic novels is chivalry, a holdover from medieval times. Walpole, amidst political turmoil, may have yearned for the 'lost' morality of the past, reflected in characters like Frederic. Before his introduction, Frederic's description hints at chivalric traits: he's a prince, suffered tragedy, and is believed to have been slain by infidels, embodying the gallant and courteous knight trope (66).",
            "Supply chain operations, in essence, entail the intricate dance of moving goods from the point of customer demand through the intricate web of raw materials acquisition, production, and final distribution to the end customer. The term \"supply chain management\" was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a pioneer in the field. Oliver described this process as the strategic planning, implementation, and control of activities within the supply chain to fulfill customer needs promptly and effectively. There are six pivotal components to a well-oiled supply chain: production, procurement, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Business managers leverage these components to ensure optimal customer service.\n\nProduction stands as the first critical phase in this chain. It serves as the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. Production planning entails deciding when, why, where, and how products will be manufactured. Managers must first understand customer desires to make informed decisions. Market analysis provides crucial insights into customer demands. Once managers have a clear understanding of market trends and customer needs, they can determine what products to manufacture and in what quantities. Next, they must decide where to produce these goods, considering factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Once the production location is established, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. Production is a pivotal stage, requiring meticulous attention to detail to avoid costly setbacks. For instance, in my experience working at Wal-Mart and Target, both companies had detailed processes for everything from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These processes ensured smooth operations without confusion or inefficiency.\n\nThe second key aspect is procurement, or supply. This involves making strategic decisions about a facility's core capabilities and forming outsourcing partnerships. A company might have multiple production divisions for a single product, each with unique equipment, labor, and specialties. Managers must select the most suitable division for each product phase. Outsourcing can be a viable option to enhance speed, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. The primary aim is to provide high-quality products swiftly while minimizing costs or maintaining affordable pricing levels.",
            "In a bustling cityscape, a mysterious sign hints at clandestine activity: \"Adolf Hitler is alive in Myanmar.\" Ellen Page, the renowned actress from the film \"Juno,\" stands alone at a street corner, a cardboard placard held above her head, the cryptic message scrawled in bold letters. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is a Southeast Asian nation governed by a repressive military regime that seized power through a coup in 1962. In 2007, the country witnessed its first public protests in a decade, ignited by monks donning saffron robes. Initially, these peaceful gatherings were allowed, but soon the situation escalated into a violent conflict between the monks and the junta, with monasteries being raided and foreign journalists arrested. The official death toll stands at 13, but Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the military, claims that the toll is far higher.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. Throughout history, governments have suppressed dissent to maintain control over their citizens. The ancient Romans believed their emperors were chosen by the gods, and the Japanese considered their emperors divine figures. In contemporary times, the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s stand as stark reminders of tyranny. The atrocities committed by Adolf Hitler's 'Third Reich' during the mid-1940s are another notorious example.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz stems from his enduring career and his keen ability to orchestrate his band. His piano playing, often understated in many of the pieces selected for this assignment, belies his prowess as a composer, crafting intricate and multifaceted works that highlight the individual skills of his musicians. Ellington constructed a stage where soloists could freely improvise, while also writing tightly woven arrangements and phrases tailored to the unique styles of his band members, accentuating the ensemble's overall tone.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative sound and his approach to incorporating voices as instruments in his music. In \"Creole Love Call,\" he pioneered this technique, using voice to add textures and colors without lyrics. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece is a prime example of Ellington's ability to complement his soloists, a technique evident throughout his career. It features six choruses: the first is a call and response between the voice and reed section, with the voice starting smooth and melodic before transitioning to a rougher sound. The second chorus sees a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes blue notes. Chorus three is a sweeping clarinet solo in the high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase. The fourth chorus mirrors the first, with the brass and reed sections echoing the call and response. The fifth chorus is the piece's climax, with reeds and a syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final chorus returns to the first chorus's structure, with the voice adopting a \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument. The piece concludes with a vocal run and a dissonant trombone flourish. Ellington's use of voice in this manner is indicative of a stylistic trait that runs through his entire body of work.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" a year later, Ellington combines his skill for tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase featuring \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing creates a rich and complementary sound by incorporating the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice. This approach is further exemplified in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a key member of Ellington's orchestra, is effectively employed to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "From a young age, she harbored an unquenchable yearning for an elusive something. This longing persisted throughout her teenage years, beginning at fourteen and remaining at seventeen. Initially, she sought a tangible object, yet her focus soon shifted to a more corporeal desire. Despite the attention of several boys, none sparked any genuine interest. She puzzled over her indifference, considering various theories but finding none satisfactory. Consequently, she continued navigating life, her desire unresolved.\n\nA mundane day at home was typically unruffled, with parents who maintained a peaceful demeanor. They rarely clashed, save for occasional disputes regarding her spirited independence. She was the offspring of a serene couple, yet she possessed an exuberant personality that made her a favorite among peers.\n\nToday's serenity was disrupted by a sudden commotion. As she traversed her home, seeking creative inspiration, a swift, distressed cry echoed from the kitchen. Rushing in, she found her mother on the ground, wincing in pain. She knelt beside her, offering assistance. \"Mom, what happened?\" she cried. Her mother's words were rushed and strained. \"Hospital... need... you.\" Gently, she supported her and, thankful for her strength training, carried her to the car.

Doctors rushed to her side, and she was left in a state of anxious anticipation.\n\nHer mother had inadvertently toppled from a stepladder while attempting to retrieve a vase from the highest shelf.",
            "This investigation aimed to demonstrate the correlation between adherence to a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (MedDiet), as indicated by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed score), and reduced likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The aMed diet, a variation of the MedDiet, is distinguished by increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats compared to saturated fats, and fish, coupled with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious prospective studies have shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the MedDiet and risks associated with total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and an intervention trial revealed that the MedDiet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, prior research did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological research tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, sans a history of CVD or diabetes, who participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a 121,700 female nurse cohort in 11 US states. From 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed score six times using self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed by medical or hospital records, autopsy, or death certificates. Where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, with 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed.\n\nTo minimize random variation for individuals and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made to account for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was linked to a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the top aMed quintile exhibited lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annals of 2007, the United States was struck by a financial storm of unprecedented magnitude. Unemployment surged, the housing market went into freefall, and many of the nation's largest and most pivotal corporations found themselves in shambles. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting us to delve into its origins and seek solutions to prevent it from recurring: what caused this crisis, and how can we mitigate future occurrences? Essentially, the root of this financial crisis was a combination of reckless political decision-making and an inadequate financial infrastructure that compelled banks and firms to dispense sub-prime loans. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were coerced into backing and repackaging these mortgages into CDO's and CDS's. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, banks found themselves strapped for capital reserves, which they passed on to the repackaged mortgages and, subsequently, the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this calamity were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999. The President, eyeing a second term, took measures to boost his popularity by easing lending regulations. This move set the stage for the sub-prime crisis just seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times sounded an ominous note in 1999, reporting that, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, was under increasing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals, and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its extraordinary growth in profits.\" Holmes accurately predicted the consequences of these actions, warning that, \"But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble during an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\" As detailed in the introduction, imprudent lending would indeed lead to the collapse of the economy.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economy's descent into chaos, one of which was the intricate structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively utilized in the years leading up to the crisis, further intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This resulted in U.S. households and financial markets taking on excessive leverage in the housing sector, leaving them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nAs the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had purchased these mortgage-backed securities were left reeling. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, constituting about 30% of the USA's GDP. In the aftermath, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a significant discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks under stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, exposition. That section where you, as a writer, either soar to new heights or crash and burn. It's where your prose can either enchant or bore. Dr. Merlin, too, has had her share of shouting matches with her screen over too much information, and not in the exciting way.\n\nMy dear readers, you're likely aware of the crucial advice: \"Show, don't tell.\" Yet, Dr. Merlin still finds herself ensnared in web of words that might as well be a block of text with nothing happening. Or worse, an overload of information. Exposition, that sneaky little voice, whispers to get the history out of the way to reach the main events. Not to be confused with the other voice urging you to spill every detail, from birth to death.\n\nExposition means relaying information in a straightforward manner, typically through simple prose. In films, it's when one character dumps a load of information on another, akin to a long-winded soliloquy. In literature, the author is the one doing the telling.\n\nConsider this example: While reading a story, you're told about the heroine's first encounter with her beloved, their opulent wedding, and her husband's tragic demise. You wouldn't expect these events to span two pages, with each of them barely speaking. You'd hope the author invests time in the husband's character, showcasing his love through words and actions. Similarly, the heroine should demonstrate through subtle cues how her life was transformed by his presence. A thorough introduction to the husband's character allows you to emotionally invest in his fate and understand the heroine's world better. You'd mourn his loss with her, growing closer to her character in the process.\n\nIn essence, you should add substance to the skeletal outline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, resist the urge to swiftly move past certain elements. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know about their past service in the Air Force, their current role as a gas station night manager, their marital history, their weekend hobby, their secret dreams, and their breakfast preference. Provide these details, but weave them into the narrative naturally.",
            "I tuned in to two news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first was a live broadcast on NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The headline reported on a man in Ashley, Ohio, who had allegedly stabbed his wife. Her name was not mentioned, but the suspect’s name was Shad Hostettler. His mugshot was shown, and he appeared sinister. The story was covered briefly, focusing mainly on his apprehension. I thought the coverage was adequate.\n\nThe second story concerned an early morning shooting incident in the Sharon Woods area. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, was critically injured. There were no arrests or suspects at the time, and the SWAT team was investigating. This story seemed rushed, possibly due to the victim’s racial background. I've observed that minority victims often receive less attention in media reports, especially compared to white victims. For instance, if a white child goes missing or is the victim of a crime, the media goes into a frenzy, but when a minority is involved, it's lucky if it's even mentioned.\n\nNext, there was a story about a bullet hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details about the potential scene were provided, and it was determined that the hole was caused by a .22 caliber rifle bullet. Crime-Stoppers are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter’s arrest.\n\nAnother story was about predicted rain and thunderstorms for Saturday afternoon. The forecast mentioned temperatures in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The coverage was brief, likely to keep viewers engaged.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF was also reported. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned black man in a hooded sweatshirt, around six feet tall and 150 pounds. I found it unusual that so much emphasis was placed on his race and complexion.\n\nFinally, there was a report about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin. He was sentenced for conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio from Texas. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, they mentioned \"300 months.\" I wondered if they thought this sounded harsher, or if it was simply a formatting choice. They also mentioned his Hispanic background, which seemed irrelevant to the story.",
            "Fraternal bonds are a unique tapestry, woven with threads of love, pride, envy, and malice. This profound connection, unlike any other, allows brothers to decipher one another's thoughts and feelings with an unparalleled acuity. In times of crisis, this bond reveals its true essence, both in its grandeur and its darkness. Embracing the emotions that stem from this bond is a heavy burden, as is understanding the reactions they engender. When one gazes into their brother's eyes, they see not an outsider's perception but their own true reflection. The mirror held up by their actions and their consequences unveils their genuine character.\n\nIn the narrative \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers navigate the labyrinth of these emotions. In a landscape richly painted and alive with detail, they set forth on a hopeless quest. The final scene is a clash of bitterness and intense pride, with only one brother's survival. The theme is evident through the protagonist's direct portrayal and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which conveys the protagonist's complex feelings and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are a testament to one overriding emotion: pride. From their earliest outings to their fateful finale, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearned for a sibling to share his world with, someone to teach his skills, like \"…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…\" He wanted a companion with whom to \"…race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…\" Alas, fate dealt him a harsh hand, as Doodle was born with a frail heart, making it improbable he would survive, let alone participate in physical activities. This cruel twist shattered the young protagonist's dreams. He even grappled with dark thoughts, contemplating suffocating his brother with a pillow. However, his heart melted when Doodle smiled at him, instilling hope. This moment reveals the protagonist's heart, showing that his hatred wasn't absolute. Deep down, he had a natural love for his brother.",
            "The human cerebrum is an intricate, ingenious information-handling mechanism. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to contemporary, the analogies utilized to depict the brain have likewise evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then a scroll of papyrus, then a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you delve into the mysteries of the brain, bear in mind that the utility of these analogies is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nData processing commences with inputs from our sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light photons into electrochemical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when gazing upon an image of a black cube on a white background, bottom-up processing integrates simple information like color, orientation, and border placement to determine that you are seeing a cube. Top-down processing employs the decisions made at certain stages of the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the cube. In this scenario, top-down processing might assist you in identifying the object as a black cube rather than a hole-shaped box in the white background.\nOnce information has been processed to some extent, an attention filter decides the signal's importance and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter ensures that you do not individually notice them. Conversely, you might spot your name even when spoken amidst a cacophony of noise. There are innumerable stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nFor the brain to process information, it must first store it. There are various types of memories, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Each sensory stimulus type has specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained via an electrical signal looping through a specific series of neurons for a short duration. Long-term memory information is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain proteins.\nNumerous models exist for organizing knowledge in the brain, some based on human memory retrieval, others on computer science, and others on neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might link to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In the futuristic realm of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World,\" a stark critique of burgeoning technological advancements and capitalist systems unfolds. The society within is built on communal living, where individualism is shunned, and instant gratification is prioritized. From birth, citizens are indoctrinated into this system, making them pawns in a grand scheme orchestrated by the World Controller. A Marxist lens reveals Huxley's reservations about the development of these systems, with terms like homogenization and reification underscoring the work's commentary on economic flaws from his time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the concept of false consciousness, as the populace is kept in the dark about their true economic standing. This ideological control over the working class, evident in Brave New World's citizens, is reinforced by hypnopædia, which encourages excessive consumption and indulgence. The World Controller manipulates these desires, creating a hegeonic society where lower classes remain unaware of their manipulation. This is akin to the common folk 'investing' in a system that perpetuates capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, while aware, fail to challenge the status quo, with even characters like Bernard remaining content with their place.\n\nIn Brave New World, interpersonal relationships lack depth. Characters, even major ones, are depicted as one-dimensional, possibly hinting at the loss of free will and expression due to the rise of technology and capitalism. Emotions are kept superficial, with conversations focusing solely on physical attributes and shallow encounters. Each societal stratum's acceptance of their position in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience to their role within the community mirrors Marxist ideas of the proletariat, who are persuaded of their supremacy so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for a couple of years now, spanning four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus can be a challenge, and I'm not alone in this. My freshman year, I was assigned a room in East Halls, the easternmost residential area, barely next to the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traversing to classes in distant locations like the Willard Building, near the campus heart, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially when the weather was against me. A conversation with a recent graduate revealed that the East Halls dorms were once isolated by vast, unused land. Now, that space has been transformed into sports fields, new facilities like the Creamery and health services building, and encircled by apartments. As campus growth increases, commuting becomes more arduous. The solution? A bicycle. However, bikes alone won't solve the issue. Students must embrace them, and the campus must be cyclist-friendly.\n\nA friend who restarted cycling after a break shared his enthusiasm, \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said, \"it's just the most efficient way to get around.\" Cycling not only benefits your health but also your time. A bowl of oatmeal and some exercise can take you up to 30 miles. Like many students, I now reside off-campus, as distant as some dorms. My smartest move this year was investing in a bike. Commutes to classes in Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk from my place, now take just 5 minutes on my bike. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route, isn't always bike-friendly. Walking, while beneficial, is not feasible for me due to my busy schedule. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes each day. That's over two and a half hours per week, not including other classes, appointments, etc. Time I can't afford to lose."
