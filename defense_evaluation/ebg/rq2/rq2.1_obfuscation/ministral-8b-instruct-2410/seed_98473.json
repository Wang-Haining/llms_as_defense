            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "The subsequent paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives on the issue of insomnia. The Biological model concentrates on genetic attributes and health-related aspects, while the Sociocultural model explores environmental factors and how they relate to demographics, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into both models, selecting specific research to elucidate each and critiquing the findings for their respective strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be classified into three main types: primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental conditions, and those resulting from external factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Axis I or Axis II disorders, which are categorized under mental health conditions, can also cause sleep difficulties. Dyssomnias encompass conditions like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, while Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological disturbances during sleep. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with some consideration of their connection to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic makeup and physiological aspects. Orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus play a critical role in sleep-wake regulation. Research conducted on mice found that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons influence sleep and wakefulness. Activation of the GABAA receptor can promote sleep, whereas its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and promote sleep. The use of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in the mice study. This suggests that similar mechanisms may operate in humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for this receptor's function. However, a deficiency or dysfunction in this receptor could impair one's ability to sleep properly without medication. The Sociocultural implications of this research suggest that heritable phenotypes could naturally regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could disrupt sleep, thereby negatively affecting various aspects of life, such as education, work, and daily tasks requiring concentration.",
            "This essay will discuss three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). Initially, the disorder will be defined. Then, the process of diagnosis will be explained, highlighting typical indicators or \"red flags\". Lastly, the essay will explore strategies that a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can use to assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), can be defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In essence, it refers to the perceptual processing of sound in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underlies this processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. Simply put, it is a condition where the brain cannot correctly interpret sounds that are heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle with interpreting or differentiating between sounds, especially in noisy environments or when multiple sounds occur simultaneously.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that would later be known as CAPD comes from the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers, including an Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and later Kimura in 1961, began developing tests for children with communicative disorders. A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD can vary significantly. Individuals may have difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting sarcasm based on changes in voice, or understanding the sequence of auditory information. More severely affected individuals may have difficulty synthesizing sound clues or interpreting sounds in a meaningful way.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD typically involves a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills. These tests may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to specific auditory stimuli. There is currently no single, definitive test for diagnosis, and the exact cause of CAPD remains unknown. Many tests present the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli to evaluate their ability to differentiate items like numbers or words. More advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "The stagecraft of Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while donning disguises can facilitate prolonged deceptions, ultimately, one must shed these masks to avoid losing one's true self. However, concluding a deception can lead to feelings of isolation. The challenge lies in choosing between safeguarding one's identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may react indifferently to being deceived, others may feel affronted by the deception's artifice.\n\nThe theme of gender role reversal through deception raises complex questions, particularly concerning the motives behind adopting an opposite-gender guise. For Viola, her disguise is a means of self-preservation in an unfamiliar land. She initially succeeds in her ruse but finds herself estranged from her female peers, cutting off a crucial support network. Additionally, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and develop romantic feelings. “Where shall I go, my lord? Cesario, stay with me as my husband.” (5.1.138) Moreover, Viola must navigate suppressed romantic interests, namely with Orsino: “Boy, you've told me a thousand times that you should not love a woman like me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nThis perspective, though somewhat progressive, may seem problematic to modern audiences. Twelfth Night could be seen as demonstrating how deception can help release hidden emotions, notably in Olivia and Orsino's cases. It's possible that their feelings for Cesario/Viola bring to light unacknowledged desires they've suppressed. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of his male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? This scenario seems unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to judge others based on their appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, regarding Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a romantic interest: “You are my sister.” (5.1.315)",

The complexity of colonial rule across German colonies is significant, exhibiting diverse policies and governance. Educational initiatives varied widely. Upon seizing German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British encountered a populace with substantial levels of education and literacy. Similarly, contemporary accounts praised educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies. In stark contrast, South West Africa (today's Namibia) presented a markedly different scenario. While East Africa saw government-run state schools and substantial native education, South West Africa relied heavily on missionary societies with limited government backing. The colonial government, however, invested considerably in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools rigorously. These educational policies had enduring impacts on South West Africa, even post-German rule. Unlike other German colonies, South West Africa saw the majority of its population remain uneducated and illiterate due to a variety of social, political, and economic factors. This thesis aims to delve into these factors, focusing on recent research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German, originating from the early 20th century, coinciding with or immediately following German rule. Early works often described educational systems in these colonies. Later English publications expanded on this, offering comparative studies and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted notable differences in educational systems across colonies. Cohen's work, which compares education in South West Africa and East Africa, is particularly relevant to this study. Cohen attributes many distinctions in South West Africa's educational system to its large settler population.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, though much of the territory was arid desert. This climate influenced the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to approximately 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the last century, encompassing numerous genres that can be challenging to enumerate entirely. Further complicating this, most genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—have birthed numerous sub and sub-sub genres within their domains. Notably, Heavy Metal rock, emerging in the past four decades, has become one of the most multifaceted and expressive genres in popular music. Its expressiveness stems from its broad emotional spectrum, albeit leaning towards darker emotions. It is also characterized by its diversity, with early adopters recognizing its flexibility and subsequently developing various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nIn contemporary heavy metal, the multitude of niche sub-genres has made it difficult to pinpoint the exact essence of heavy metal. It has absorbed elements from various other genres, yet it has its roots in a specific origin. To comprehend the vast landscape of metal music today, one must first understand the metal movement and its distinction from a traditional genre.\n\nMetal can be seen as a movement defined by its darker themes. It is often referred to as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, louder volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. It is less primitive and more technically proficient, with band members exhibiting impressive musical skills. Additionally, metal is renowned for its association with drug experimentation. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s led to artists creating wild, otherworldly music, using drugs as an inspiration. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, which were not previously prominent in popular music. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, exemplify the darker themes prevalent in metal. This song is considered one of the earliest heavy metal tracks and was a response to a similarly darker song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles aimed to prove they could match the Stones' heavier, darker style by including it in their album The White Album.",
            "Years prior to the Surrealists' dream-inspired paintings, artist Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both in reality and imagination. The Dream, painted in 1910, does not merely depict a woman enthralled by her dreamt landscape but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations. From the outset of his work, he envisioned recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, grappling with an internal conflict to attain this goal. This struggle is epitomized in The Dream, where Rousseau must choose between conforming to established styles for acceptance or forging his own unique artistic path.\n\nTo comprehend The Dream, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's life. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a prosperous tinsmith and hardware merchant. Raised without formal artistic training, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until his late forties. Widowed and grieving the loss of eight infant children and his first wife, Clémence, he turned to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike his peers who idealized rural life, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of his lower-class peers.\n\nRousseau's desire for art world acceptance is understandable given his background. Unlike his contemporaries, he had no formal training and began his career later in life, competing with renowned artists like Matisse. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that Matisse, driven by a fear of clichés, and Rousseau, seeking conventional recognition, were both driven by different motivations. \"Matisse, driven by a fear of painting tritely, while Rousseau's desire was to paint conventionally to be admitted to the Artiste Français,\" Gordon states.",
            "Numerous philosophers have posited an intrinsic bond between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I contend that this connection stems from a profound source. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience. Yet, we often find ourselves appreciating ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics strive to explain, rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty are typically attempts to elucidate why something is beautiful or moral, not to establish rules for judgment or creation.\n\nTake, for instance, the criticism of art or morals. A discourse on the worth of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might involve concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but fundamentally, these do not encapsulate why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, we often hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding more detailed explanations. I argue that both art and morals cannot be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics shares this transcendent essence. As Wittgenstein notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I posit that this ineffable \"something\" is the most potent attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that forges a connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely intertwined because we experience them most profoundly at a noumenal level, to borrow a Kantian term. They impact us at an experiential depth that transcends explanation. This bond is particularly evident in the art of literature. As McKean contends, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inapplicable to other arts, such as music, but they seem as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is significant to us precisely because of the values we encounter there.\"",
            "The modern-day Germany is regarded as a formidable nation, a unified entity possessing a vibrant cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is palpable in Cologne along the River Rhine, through the heart of the country, and into the Saxon city of Dresden, situated on the Elbe. Such a rich cultural landscape is a testament to Germany's diverse origins, stemming from various tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins are hotly debated among scholars and historians. Some attribute it to a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in warfare against the Gauls, as documented by Tacitus in 98 AD. Others propose the name comes from a spear used in battle, called a \"ger,\" or possibly from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' prowess in warfare. Julius Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, employs the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et Situe Germani,\" describes the Germans as indigenous and unadulterated, having migrated via sea rather than land. He queries why one would choose to move from Asia or Africa to Germany, given its harsh climate and people's sullen demeanor. The Romans, facing these hardy Germanic tribes on their empire's periphery, primarily engaged in trade and occasional skirmishes, with Germanic warriors often serving in the Roman army. As the first century drew to a close, these tribes began appearing in large numbers, living on the empire's borders and exchanging goods and skills.",
            "A gaze downwards, mind hollow and attentive, took in the scene before me. Coldly, silently, with a trained detachment, I observed the subject of study, an object that my mind processed but refused to connect to any abstract comprehension. Ideas flitted in and out of my consciousness, so swiftly and seamlessly that it seemed I had no genuine thoughts of my own, merely a fluid and dynamic experience of what lay before my eyes.\n\nOnce, driven by an artist’s recommendation, I bought a drawing manual titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" My fascination with drawing began at the age of six, and this book teaches everything from understanding the basics of a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. A method the book advocates is to frame any image with a square, thus simplifying overwhelming detail and isolating the focus.\n\nIn that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't impose such a frame. I was too engrossed, too captivated to do more than gaze in awe. Masters like Picasso, Monet, and the Italian Renaissance painters had their unique styles, and here was the beginning of my own work, a potential masterpiece in brown.\n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and released as my hand moved through space, my mind giving form to creativity. Water swirled serene and clear. Matter broke away and disappeared. Muscles twitched faster, anxiety rising as I hit the toilet handle again. The brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug.\n\nGripping the mop loosely, feet wide apart, tie knotted tightly around my throat, I scowled at the mess. A few more flushes, a few moments of reflection, and my hand reached for the toilet paper sheet. It was wrapped around my hand like an oven mitt. Straightening up, bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for Thanksgiving dinner….",
            "Adolescents are perishing at the wheel. A confluence of factors engenders this grim reality for our youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that one aspect of the problem lies in the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not yet adept at coping with the perils of driving. Add to this the compounding factor of inexperience, which not only elevates the incidence of fatal crashes but also aggravates the risk of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens, in particular, are more vulnerable when accompanied by their peers, a behavior that, as is well-known, is commonplace among them. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. California and other states have implemented measures such as temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these provisional licenses are, in my view, merely a temporary solution. The underlying issue is that, collectively, young drivers are statistically unfit to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman posits that even 18 years old may be too youthful for a standard driver’s license. USA Today reports Zuckerman’s research indicating a pronounced inclination among those under the age of 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behaviors. Therefore, it seems logical to postpone driving until this inclination subsides. If we persist in granting driver’s licenses to adolescents, we can anticipate an escalating number of deadly accidents. By 2010, the baby boomers' children will reach driving age, and millions of new adolescent drivers will be ready to hit the road. Legislation addressing this issue could be fairly straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver’s education classes, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full driver’s license, with a predetermined number of practical driver training hours required, based on the majority of states’ current standards. Since these grim statistics span all states, a uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and potentially effective means of safeguarding teens across the nation. The legislation I propose is not an untested concept.",
            "Diving into the treasures of the Library of Congress's early Edison film archive, I stumbled upon fifteen trick films crafted between 1895 and 1901. These films exploit clever editing to create optical illusions. My analysis primarily delved into the poetic elements that underpin most trick films, while also scrutinizing the peculiarities in a handful of later films. The trick films of that era are typically confined within a static proscenium, using long and medium shots, and adhering to a one-shot-per-film philosophy. However, a few daring innovators began to experiment with multiple shots early in the 20th century.\n\nA distinctive feature of these trick films is their filming within a static stage setting, visualized through a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed, not moving to track figures or objects. This static approach was common in early cinema, drawing inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. Trick films, in particular, often mirror vaudeville magic acts, where performers move side-to-side, but never approach or leave the camera. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). Actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the stage, with the camera never following their action.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style often results in long and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from these films, reflecting the theatre tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance. Actors typically remain in the mid-ground, avoiding close-ups. This one-shot-per-film standard limited most trick films to a minute or less in length, and their content to short vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, it's essential to note that the one-shot concept is deceptive; a single \"shot\" can comprise multiple joined segments to create illusions like apparitions or disappearances. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a close look reveals the transition where Mary's head appears to be severed, despite the film feeling like one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, a resident of Caroline, was an early and enthusiastic advocate of Republicanism. Despite his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and brief tenure in politics, his commitment to personal liberty and governance was evident. His dedication to an agrarian lifestyle significantly influenced his views on governance, with his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system being heavily rooted in this belief. Taylor sought to preserve and promote what he considered the superior career, thereby coloring his arguments on these matters. He posited that the United States had the unique opportunity to establish an ideal governance system due to the absence of native traditions that could hinder such a creation, allowing for a system of self-government. Taylor strongly believed in the interconnectedness of natural rights, asserting that if any right is denied, others are weakened in value. He argued that these rights should be immune to government intervention. He contended that the \"state of nature\" denoted the dominance of individuals with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence, but that in a civilized society, this should not be the case. To create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that recognized both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He was steadfast in his dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, likely led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, is a natural human trait, but it becomes evil when it leads to sub-societies that exploit others. A good government is necessary to control this inherent evil, and even then, it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles. Taylor, like many of his Republican contemporaries, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, favoring a minimal Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could become oppressive due to its expense, but believed a literal interpretation without consideration of the writers' intent could lead to corruption. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting the data from Figure 17, a significant plunge in commuter log submissions was noted during the third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and the root cause remains unclear. The onset of winter in a New England setting likely contributed to a drop in those commuting via bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December marks the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with wrapping up coursework and grading. The commuter log submission process may have been inadvertently overlooked due to these distractions. Furthermore, December's busy holiday season culminates in a one-month break, with many not needing to visit campus during this period. The restart of classes in late January may also account for the low log submissions. However, the February dip remains unexplained. It is conceivable that any such project experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a natural decline. To boost engagement, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which indeed led to an uptick in log submissions. Thus, maintaining project traction amidst declining engagement and semester breaks was a major hurdle. Another obstacle was the deeply ingrained preference for driving, which is a significant part of our culture. To incentivize alternative commuting modes, we offered a variety of rewards, including gift certificates to local businesses. It would have been intriguing to assess the impact of larger prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car. If the prize values had increased over time, engagement may have improved.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument that tracks an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, akin to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility as it trades on an exchange like a stock. This type of fund provides the diversification of an index fund along with the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and purchase as few as one share. Despite these alluring benefits, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. However, a key drawback is the necessity to pay a commission for each trade, similar to stock transactions. Furthermore, the extensive range of available funds offers a variety of options. Nonetheless, it is essential for astute investors to assess whether the touted benefits, such as diversification, genuinely exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will scrutinize the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to determine if holding a single ETF can approximate the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, as well as to ascertain if there are more optimal configurations of these stocks to enhance the Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nConsidering the impracticality of including every holding, we have elected to focus on the top ten holdings, which constitute 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of these top holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we will normalize the current percentages of assets to 100% and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio comprises only these ten stocks in the proportion held by the ETF. The Beta and Return calculations are shown in the table beneath.\n\nFrom the table, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. Based on these findings, a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, the statistical significance of this difference remains to be determined.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% for a comparative assessment of their combined standard deviation in relation to the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's more notable compositions, \"Dream-Land,\" is often considered one of his finest works. Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference traceable to Virgil, who utilized it in relation to an island north of Britain, deemed the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, another source merits consideration. Poe's interest in German authors is well-documented, making the connection to Goethe plausible.\nThis connection bears significance as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarity between the two poets' works, suggesting Poe was inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe is renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of Faust, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" appears, detailing a king whose wife's death following a gift of a goblet leads to his own demise, marked by heavy drinking and despair. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with the latter's speaker sharing a similar state of melancholy and despair.\nPoe's references to Thule are not isolated. He uses the term \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employs \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land\" as bookends to the poem. This suggests a deliberate echoing of \"The King of Thule.\" The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a dark, lonely landscape, haunted by the specters of dead friends, and a world lacking color—scenes that resonate with the despair of Goethe's king. The poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" functioning as a direct interpretation of Goethe's poem. Poe's admiration for Tennyson further strengthens the connection, as he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through Tennyson's influence and the numerous reproductions of Goethe's works in his time.",
            "In accordance with California law, would it be feasible for a patron who suffered an injury after slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket to secure punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager's inaction was motivated by malice? A judge may hesitate to summarily reject Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim. To establish a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were intentional and included a disregard for the probable harm, as well as evidence of conduct that is considered despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of leaving the spill uncleaned, given the multiple incidents at D&D involving customers slipping in the months prior to her accident. While her argument regarding despicable conduct might be less convincing, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents reported in 2009 with no appropriate actions taken for safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, an employee of D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to address customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. At 5:30 PM on the same day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of obligation not stemming from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct aiming to cause harm, or, lacking intent, with a \"willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when committed with a disregard for a plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Four years ago, I engaged in a course on Islam at CBC. The class frequently debated whether Islam is inherently hostile, a discourse that seems more pertinent today than ever. Since the events of 9/11, I've noticed a shift in media perception, moving from a hostile stance towards extremism to a hyper-tolerant view of Islam. In 2001, it's doubtful a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his evident Muslim background, could have been conceived.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography captivates me, yet it diverges from my understanding of Muhammad. Historical accounts depict him as a conqueror, forcing tribes to adopt Islam. In contrast, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly awaiting converts. This discrepancy suggests a narrative intent to elevate Muhammad without necessitating miracles or proof.\n\nMoreover, parallels drawn between Jesus and Muhammad's ministries, such as the multiplication of food, create an impression of Muhammad as a humble prophet. This approach appears to diminish Jesus' life and miracles, potentially appropriating His legacy for Muhammad.\n\nSeveral tales in the biography present a third-party perspective, replicating a chain of hearsay: \"So-and-so heard from so-and-so...\" While intended to validate stories, this method diminishes their credibility.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the glorification of Muhammad as a gentle, wise, and humble figure, despite historical evidence contradicting this image. If Muslims today were aware of Muhammad's true ascension to power, it might challenge their perception of him.",
            "The message and convictions espoused by Jesus during his tenure on Earth seemed to be swiftly eclipsed, as the evolving landscape of Christian thought diverged progressively from its roots. A cursory examination of this trajectory reveals a trend where Christianity has steadily distanced itself from its inception. In our contemporary world, there is an evident growth in awareness and a burgeoning progressive mindset. However, it's important to acknowledge that those who cling to traditional teachings may not be a predominant force. In the future, there will likely be a surge in historical consciousness among Christians, a desire to delineate between the doctrines appended over time and the genuine intent of Christianity's namesake. This process may take generations, but the ultimate outcome is unavoidable: a significant shift back to Christianity's original form. A movement will emerge, systematically stripping away superfluous doctrines, akin to rewinding time, until what remains is an unadulterated version of Jesus' teachings, untainted by subsequent thought leaders. As this change sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses to practice as they did in Jesus' time, the church will persist as a guiding force. Yet, due to this theological regression, the previously rampant diversity in Christian thought and practice will give way to increasing uniformity. Regional, denominational, and factional differences will yield to similarities. Throughout history, such reversals have occurred. Once shunned and persecuted, Christians were later adopted by the Roman Empire. Similarly, our nation has transitioned from oppressing to uplifting African Americans. The impending reversal in Christian history will mirror these changes, seeking the original source and reducing diversity in the process. A key factor in this will be a shift in interpreting Jesus' words as symbolic rather than literal. So, what transpired following Jesus' lifetime?\nIf we peer deeply into the past, we find Judaism, the foundational theology of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the supremacy of Hebrew scriptures were core to this religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. This Jewish population was not united but divided into various factions, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common folk.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" presents a chilling portrait of human nature, revealing the innate greed and selfishness that drives individuals to prioritize personal gain over the well-being of others. The narrative exemplifies this through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who seek to expand their empires with unyielding determination, disregarding the collateral damage caused by their relentless pursuit. Sinclair vividly illustrates the environmental fallout, with \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the callous indifference towards pollution and its consequences. The owners' disregard for their employees is equally evident, with \"So from the top to the bottom, the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar,\" showcasing the exploitative nature of their operations. The lack of worker protections during this period enabled this cruel exploitation, forcing employees to toil in deplorable conditions and face sudden dismissals without compensation or support. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were as much victims of servitude as those in chattel slavery, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Various writers implement distinctive methods to evoke specific emotions or sentiments in their readers concerning pivotal themes. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques in his literary work, \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create an atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns significance to symbols, utilizing them for similar purposes. This latter technique is frequently employed by Fitzgerald, particularly with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald elaborates on the symbolic meaning of these colors and later employs this meaning to remind readers of certain feelings regarding important elements.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity involves assigning white a higher, more refined connotation, and gray a more dated, faded one. This is established early in the novel through repeated mentions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white,\" as are Nick's attire at Gatsby's party, Tom's shirt during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine's powdered milky complexion. White/gray uniformity is further emphasized by the color of less significant subjects and characters: Nick encounters \"the white chasms of lower New York\" on his way to work, and at Gatsby’s parties, names are \"gray\" on Nick's schedule. Additionally, Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" and plain or ordinary people are described as white or gray, such as the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child, and the \"gray old man\" dog-seller.\n\nHaving instilled the meaning of white/gray in these ways, Fitzgerald uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity in characters and objects. This strategy begins with Daisy, who is described in white after a period of significant absence from the narrative, making her appear less like a developed character and more like a uniform addition desired by Gatsby. This technique is reinforced with repeated use of white and gray around Daisy, such as her fur collar described as \"a gray haze\" and her attire in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "The county of San Diego boasts a thriving agricultural landscape, bolstered by its temperate, sun-drenched environment. The region's crops are diverse, encompassing tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic, locally sourced produce is robust, with numerous community-supported agriculture programs featuring extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk also enjoy high popularity. Many organic farms offer immersive tours and recreational experiences, such as hiking and birdwatching, while integrating government programs to maximize both financial benefits and ecological preservation.\n\nOrganic farming, despite being more labor-intensive and costly than conventional methods, offers the advantage of increased biodiversity and a healthier environment due to the absence of chemicals. However, it faces challenges such as higher labor and management costs, potential yield losses, and a lack of operational scale efficiency. Beyond organic farming practices, additional wildlife-friendly measures may further escalate labor costs, including planting cover crops, managing grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth for specific ecological conditions.\n\nThe selected property is a 160-acre parcel located near the town of Potrero, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This area is home to various plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or at risk, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. The land, previously inhabited by Native Americans and later used for cattle ranching and wood production, is currently under review for its conservation potential.\n\nI selected this property from an online real estate listing and explored various government programs to assist small farmers in cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a hypothetical model, I identified an organic farm in the same area to illustrate what a landowner might strive to achieve.",
            "The role of culture in negotiations is multifaceted and profound. Culture, in essence, can be understood as much by what it excludes as what it includes, and the meaning it conveys. It is neither uniform nor monolithic. Stereotypes such as \"all Germans are punctual\" or \"all French are romantic\" oversimplify and generalize cultural nuances. While understanding these generalizations is useful, a negotiator should focus on the specific cultural context and its impact on discussions. Encountering a foreign culture often leads to comparisons with one's own, but true comprehension involves studying history, recognizing biases, and embracing rather than altering it. In negotiations, particularly when one holds a less advantageous position, understanding and respecting the local culture can break down barriers and advance the dialogue.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that corporate culture, too, can vary widely, regardless of national boundaries. Within a single country, companies may promote different work environments, from long hours to flexible schedules. Observing employee attire, communication styles, and hiring practices can reveal a company's cultural identity. For example, some businesses promote employee philanthropy broadly, while others restrict it to approved causes. Even within the United States, corporate cultures can vary greatly, from coast to coast and across urban and suburban regions. Some cultures appear more homogeneous, but a deeper dive is necessary to uncover their true complexity.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally, if not more, important. Values provide the motivation behind a culture's actions. If preserving face or maintaining harmony is valued, a negotiator would avoid public confrontation to achieve success. Conversely, a culture valuing aggressive bargaining might not settle quickly. Recognizing these values before negotiations begins is essential, but personal insights into the opponent's background can also enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The quote, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" appears initially in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is the opening of St. Anselm’s argument for the existence of God. Aquinas, another notable figure, shares a similar stance, and our task is to appraise the strength of their arguments. To simplify our comparison, we'll assume both belief in the Bible's God is valid. An alternative divine figure might hinder our assessment, as their arguments focus on this specific concept. Both authors shed light on noteworthy points, though neither argument fully substantiates God's existence.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument hinges on introspection. He posits that God's existence is evident within our understanding, necessitating no external evidence. This idea, though somewhat convoluted, posits that God's proof lies within our minds. This is akin to the Christian principle of faith, accepting truths without definitive empirical proof.\n\nContrasting Aquinas, he insists God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This would aid evangelism by persuading through logic alone. Aquinas presents five arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each underscoring the logical necessity of God. If given a puzzle with one missing piece, logical deduction dictates knowing its features without seeing it directly.",
            "Around the midpoint of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a royal figure destined to be revered as Buddha came into being. Throughout his life, he chose to forsake worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, giving birth to Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being Theravada. This ancient faith is nearing its twenty-fifth century, and its appearance today is vastly different from its origins. For example, in the Theravada-majority nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ritual is observed. Participants, be they monks or laypeople, engage in this ritual, underscoring its religious significance, despite Buddha never having advocated any such celebration. These discrepancies span from outward traditions to the religion’s core tenets. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from the monastic or secular vantage, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both external and internal factors, both hostile and amicable.\nIn this discourse, certain pivotal terms will be frequently employed. Internal forces are defined as those stemming from the Buddha's teachings, regardless of one's role within the community. External forces encompass influences from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, conversely, do not aim to cause harm or aid the community, though their outcomes may vary.\nTo commence, let us examine Buddhism's foundational principles. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, essentially, comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka encompasses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is crucial for escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, along with its associated passions—lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion)—upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes life rules, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct, and not ingesting intoxicants), and monks observing many more rules. The most fundamental Buddhist doctrine is the four noble truths. Life is marked by suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes this suffering, and it can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, a period marked by significant tension and conflict. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. This was part of a broader series of disputes between the two nations, many of which were rooted in cultural, religious, and economic differences, as well as territorial claims and border issues (Diehl & Goerts, 2000, p. 145). Comparably, other neighboring nations have also experienced enduring rivalries due to shared borders and differing interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that only Mexico and Cuba had persistent, overarching American diplomatic issues, largely due to their geographical proximity and historical rivalries (p. 41). religious differences were a significant factor, with Americans often opposing Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring the ideological struggles of the Cold War but focused on religious preferences rather than political structure (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). These historical and cultural animosities, inherited from their former colonial rulers, posed substantial challenges to forming amicable relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes during this rivalry, most of which were territorial in nature, involving border raids and frontier issues that persisted until both countries deployed military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, marking a shift from territorial expansion to economic intervention as a primary concern for the United States in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years past, I was unexpectedly disabled by an affliction I had not previously known existed. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession due to an ingrained need for security and stability that my childhood lacked. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" was the refrain I heard as I grew into adolescence and beyond. Thus, despite my dreams of becoming a scientist or journalist, I found myself in nursing. Yet here I was: 46 years old, unmarried, penniless, and unable to work. Disability has been my companion for 15 years, and after living on Social Security Disability, I find myself with nothing truly mine. Life has been a constant struggle, an assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty permeates every aspect of my life, but one truth remains certain: I could not have persevered without my family's assistance and the kindness of a few friends. When disaster strikes, you realize just how vulnerable you truly are.\n\nMy message is that life is fraught with emergencies, big and small. There's no absolute security, and no amount of preparation can mitigate everything. While I agree that we should not rely solely on government, I believe we should foster trust and mutual support among Americans. The Conservatives often tout the \"rugged individualism\" that supposedly built this nation, but it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that sustained our forefathers during hard times. Pioneers crossing the Rockies did not achieve their goal alone.\n\nSo, I strongly advise: be prepared. I have disaster supplies, including a first aid kit, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for windows. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the means, consider farming and preserving food. However, while preparing, don't forget to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do remains intriguing. Are there inherent constraints steering the path of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson in 1917 opined that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, the same sentiment holds true today. Recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to mollusk skeletogenesis through both developmental and evolutionary contexts. Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of Prunum, augmented by experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes. Utilizing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies in CerioShell software. These models help interpret the limits of possible morphological transformations in Prunum, complementing experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events.\n\nA shell, fundamentally, is a spiraling tube traversing 360 degrees of space. These revolutions, or coils, are termed whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, demarcated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest coil, termed the body whorl, is the last. The spire comprises all whorls except the last, with the apex being the spire's tip and the base its opposite end. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends from its shell.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"standard\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical position and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell, then count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl as necessary.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The aperture’s trajectory can be tracked via coordinates of each whorl's center and the aperture’s horizontal and vertical radii. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied to alter mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesian neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little to no improvement over the past decade, despite the nation's progress in meeting various Millennium Development Goals such as clean water and sanitation. However, the enhancements needed for child and maternal health to meet the 2015 targets remain elusive. The underlying causes for this plight—including the prominence of traditional birth attendants and inadequate postnatal care—suggest a need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than singular programmatic initiatives.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed an increase in births attended by skilled personnel, reaching 72%. Nevertheless, this figure encompasses traditional birth attendants like midwives who lack the capacity to handle complicated pregnancies, resulting in a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Furthermore, there's a decline in the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea, and the postnatal care data reveals widespread concern.\n\nCesarean-section rates, currently at around 4%, fall short of expectations, with a stark contrast between urban (7%) and rural (2%) settings, indicating discrepancies in healthcare access. This disparity in service utilization is also evident between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap, suggesting that the impoverished face significant barriers to healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal healthcare, the critical question is how to best address the dearth of services. Should Indonesia adopt targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen the entire healthcare system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care? Vertical programs, which concentrate on improving one sector, offer targeted and manageable goals with quicker results. However, these targeted approaches can lead to resource depletion in other sectors, cause duplication of services, and increase administrative burdens due to uncoordinated programs.",
            "Victorian literature is distinguished by its meticulous attention to detail, with a particular focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, there are exceptions to this norm, such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works incorporate elements of mystery and the peculiar, which are uncommon in typical Victorian literature, thereby enhancing the characters and providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“A swarm of bewildering and perplexing ideas invaded his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were fervently arguing: for the very words they uttered echoed in his ears, and when he attempted to focus, he discovered he was conversing with them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; and amidst a flurry of shrieks and shouts, blinding lights, and chaotic noise, an unseen entity swiftly carried him away. Through this whirlwind of visions, there lingered an indistinct, unsettling awareness of pain, which gnawed and tormented him unceasingly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels employ mystery primarily through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with the content and purpose varying in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil aspects of Oliver's inner self, his anguish, and his understanding of the true nature of his surroundings. Upon revisiting the shooting of Oliver in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the dire state of his health, which was evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelmed him, numbing all his senses and leaving him unaware of the \"unseen hand\" that bore him away; he experienced his despair anew, removed from the shock of pain, with the pain now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. Given Oliver's overwhelmed state, the question arises whose will brought about his misfortune, as it could hardly have been his own. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his circumstances, even when his life is at stake. A sense of desolation in Oliver is also implied, as if the influence of old Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and impacting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day faded, or at least it seemed to. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it arrived – and night descended, a night that seemed endless, yet fleeting; long in its dreadful silence and short in its hasty flight.”",
            "Several years ago, I was an assistant in an after-school program, assisting elementary-aged students with their academic needs. My forte was in English and reading, but I was asked by a colleague to aid a young boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty with reading. His circumstances were puzzling; he could pronounce certain letters accurately, while others were completely off. Despite his Latino heritage, he spoke flawless English, which seemed contradictory. After some time, I met Adrian's mother, who communicated solely in Spanish, despite my rudimentary Spanish skills. It became evident that Adrian could read but struggled with the English alphabet and its pronunciation. This revelation, while not solving his problems, was a key insight into the language barrier many students face.\n\nThis anecdote highlights the complexity of language barriers in educational settings, particularly in California. It underscores how seemingly fluent English speakers can encounter significant hurdles in reading. The challenge is evident, but the solutions are multifaceted. For some, like Adrian, additional tutoring in English reading, especially focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations, may suffice. For others, particularly those with limited English proficiency, the solutions are more intricate.\n\nThe dual language system, which involves educating students in both their native language and English, is a promising approach. It has been proven to improve academic performance for bilingual students. However, implementing this system universally is not without its challenges. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical, employing bilingual aides or tutors can offset this. The key lies in integrating various strategies, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes, to create a comprehensive solution.",
            "From a tender age, humans are often introduced to the notion of something larger than ourselves, a concept that we cannot fully grasp or understand. Some are indoctrinated into religious institutions, while others seek guidance from within or explore various spiritual paths. Many embrace the faith instilled in them by their forebears, while others vehemently reject it, asserting that the world ends at their own personal experiences. Our journeys to define our selves are colored by our unique interpretations of spirituality, a search for illumination in the darkness to guide us towards enlightenment.\n\n“Redbirds,” my dad said casually when I inquired about his preferred aviary. We sat on the front porch, the rain's steady rhythm drumming against the metallic roof above, as we shared smokes. The downspouts channeled the water, drenching the flora around us. His gaze was distant, as if lost in contemplation and memory. He appeared gaunt, his clothes loose and his hair thinner than I recalled. His eyes avoided mine. I felt isolated, anxious, and unable to discuss with him the impending loss that would intensify our reality. I embraced him, resuming my seat closer to his, and joined him in contemplating the rain’s descent in the June twilight.\n\nMy father bid his last farewell in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The medical interventions had prolonged his suffering but prolonged his life a few additional months beyond what the physicians had anticipated; the value, however, remained elusive. What deity would inflict such pain? I questioned in solitude. In the darkness, I offered no supplications. If such a being existed, I believed it had ceased listening to me long before.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passage from this life to another. Thus, I did not bear witness. I did not desire to observe the life that had given me life as it faded. I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died. Moreover, I understood my father better than his relatives and believed he would not wish for his sole offspring to be a mere spectator at his departure. I curled into a fetal position in my bed for three days, waiting for the inevitable.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" labeled an \"Old-New oxymoron\" by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has faced varied criticism and commendation. Praised for its 'terrible sublime' and derided for its lack of depth, the Gothic mode has been a staple of literary discourse since its inception. Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a seminal work in the genre, blended ancient and modern romance elements to birth the proto-Gothic. Integrating old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature, Walpole presented a novel with a unique narrative structure, allowing readers an intimate glimpse into characters' psyches. The Gothic genre, steeped in medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, fascinated readers despite its archaic reputation. The fusion of these elements with the novel form allowed Gothic literature to persist over time, acting as both a relic of the past and a fresh exploration for later audiences.\n\nOne significant theme prevalent in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideals of chivalry, depicted in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, remain central to the genre. Chivalry appealed to Gothic writers, who sought to romanticize a bygone era they viewed as superior to their contemporary society. Walpole's personal political turmoil may have influenced his portrayal of society's moral decline, as evident in characters like Frederic. Although Frederic embodies classic chivalric traits, his depiction hints at Walpole's despair over societal moral decay. Frederic's description illustrates these themes, with Walpole emphasizing the prince's chivalric qualities, such as his status, tragic past, and imminent demise at the hands of infidels.",
            "Supply chain orchestration, a process that involves the movement of goods from the moment of customer order to the point where raw materials are transformed into end products and distributed to the customer, is a critical function in business operations. The concept was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive approach to planning, executing, and supervising the supply chain to meet customer demands swiftly and effectively. This system is composed of six fundamental elements: production, procurement, inventory, location, logistics, and information. These elements are utilized by business managers to deliver superior customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain process is production. This is the cornerstone of the entire system. Production determines the timing, purpose, location, and methodology of creating goods. Managers must comprehend customer preferences to make informed decisions. By examining market trends, managers can discern customer demands. With a clear understanding of customer needs, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. Post-decision, managers must select suitable production sites that balance volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. The subsequent focus is on workload scheduling and equipment upkeep. Production is a pivotal step; meticulous planning is essential to avoid delays and financial losses. For instance, I've worked in retail environments like Wal-Mart and Target, where each operation follows a structured plan, from uniform design to receiving shipments. These plans ensure smooth operations and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key factor in supply chain management is procurement. Procurement involves strategic decisions that define a facility's core capabilities and partnerships. A single product may require multiple production units, each with unique equipment, personnel, and specialties. Managers must select the most suitable division for various product processes. Outsourcing may also be an option to enhance velocity, which is the capacity to deliver high-quality, flexible products at reduced costs or sustained low prices.",
            "A peculiar sign reads: \"Adolf Hitler lives in Myanmar.\" Ellen Page, renowned for her role in ‘Juno’, stands solitary on a city corner, holding a makeshift placard with the chilling message scrawled in marker. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation governed by a dictatorial military council since 1962, has a history of suppressing dissent. In 2007, monks sparked street protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution,\" that grew as masses joined in. Initially tolerating these peaceful gatherings, the regime escalated to violent crackdowns, invading monasteries and imprisoning foreign journalists, with a photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fatally shot on September 27th, 2007. Officials claim 13 deaths, but defector Colonel Hla Win estimates thousands more.\n\nThis isn't novel; history is replete with rulers seeking total control. Ancient Roman emperors, Japanese emperors, and even current US presidents have had similar aspirations. Notable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the government's fatality estimates range from 200 to 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia and the Rwandan government killed Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, a period spanning several years and countries, saw the systematic murder of Jews.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on the landscape of jazz is marked by his enduring tenacity and profound creativity in guiding his orchestra. Ellington's piano presence in many of the pieces chosen for this examination is often understated, yet his prowess as a composer shines through as he fashions intricate compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington's genius lies in his ability to craft a framework that permits soloists to improvise freely, while also penning tightly structured arrangements and phrases that amplify the distinct styles of his players, creating harmonious and original sounds that complement each piece. The Grove Music dictionary attests to Ellington's sound and innovation, noting his pioneering use of voice as an instrument in \"Creole Love Call.\" This early piece showcases Ellington's adeptness at incorporating vocal textures and colors without the burden of lyrics, as well as his capacity to harmonize with the style of his soloists throughout his career. \"Creole Love Call\" is a 12-bar blues composition that unfolds over six choruses, each presenting a unique interplay between voice and instruments:\n\n- Chorus 1: A smooth, melodic vocal response, transitioning to a rougher sound midway.\n- Chorus 2: Muted trumpet solo, elaborating on the theme with extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: Soaring clarinet solo in the upper register, supported by a subtle, syncopated piano line.\n- Chorus 4: Full ensemble echo of the first chorus, with brass and reed sections engaging in a call and response.\n- Chorus 5: A climactic chorus, with reeds leading a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the initial structure, with the voice adopting a growling technique to solo as an instrument.\n\n\"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, exemplifies Ellington's skill in tight orchestration and his ear for tone color. Here, a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing merges the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. Ellington's masterful use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these techniques, with Nanton introducing the melody to great effect.\n\nEllington's consistent use of voices to enrich the tonal palette of his compositions is a recurring theme in his work.",
            "An insatiable sense of yearning had been her constant companion since she was 14. This unquenched desire, now three years later, at 17, had shifted from a material need to a more personal one. Yet, no suitor had piqued her interest. Boys had courted her, but none sparked her curiosity or affections. This enigma baffled her, and years of introspection had yielded only theories that left her unsatisfied. Despite this inner turmoil, she lived her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nA typical day at home was usually tranquil. Her parents, serene individuals, rarely clashed with each other or their daughter. Their only discord was her independent streak. The only child of calm parents, she was known for her liveliness and kindness.\n\nToday, however, serenity eluded her. As she traversed the house seeking inspiration, her mother's anguished cry echoed from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic rising as she cried, \"Mom?!

            "This investigation sought to demonstrate the impact of adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as gauged by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed score), on the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, including stroke mortality. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes; monounsaturated fats in place of saturated fats; and fish, coupled with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPreviously conducted research has shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality (CVD). An intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in achieving weight loss and lowering the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis longitudinal study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Six times, between 1984 and 2004, an aMed score was calculated from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that measured nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses remained in the study for the entire 20-year period. FFQ data underwent validation. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical, hospital, autopsy, or death records. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate individual random variation and reflect long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs were computed. Adjustments were made for potential confounders, including age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazards modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, utilizing separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke occurrences.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was associated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk, 0.71).",
            "In the year 2007, the United States of America encountered a severe financial calamity. Unemployment surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous significant corporations were left in disarray. This economic downturn persists to this day, prompting us to investigate: what triggered this crisis, and how can we prevent its recurrence? Essentially, the financial crisis was sparked by a combination of self-serving and misguided political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into offering subprime loans within an inadequately developed financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves lacking sufficient capital reserves, which they then passed on to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately spreading the chaos to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999, as the President sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently paving the way for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted the consequences of these actions: “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced significant pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes accurately foreshadowed the potential fallout: “However, the government-subsidized corporation could face difficulties in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As highlighted in the introduction, and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending would inevitably lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the increasing complexity of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years preceding the crisis, further interlinking various economic sectors with the housing market. This overleveraging of households and financial markets in the housing sector made them highly susceptible to even minor fluctuations in price.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities in disarray. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion worth of mortgage debts, which constituted approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at distressed prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transition into commercial banks under intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the beginning stages of a narrative—where the wings are tested, and the audience either soars or drifts off into a slumber, often with a glare and a finger hovering over the back button. Dr. Merlin has been known to lash out at her screen during these moments, evidenced by the telltale echo of her frustrated screams. Exposition, it turns out, is not always a welcome visitor.\n\nWhile the maxim \"Show, don't tell\" may be well-known, Dr. Merlin often finds herself entangled in dense passages where action is scarce, or, even worse, overloaded with trivia. Exposition is the whisper in your ear, urging you to rush through the past to get to the points of interest. It's not the same as the voice urging you to share every minutiae of your characters' backgrounds.\n\nExposition, by definition, is the sharing of information, typically in a straightforward manner.

You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold in two pages, with each of them uttering only a couple of lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he feels for his wife. Similarly, the heroine should demonstrate through her actions how his presence enriched her life. This would allow you to feel his death as if it were your own, and thus, connect with the heroine more deeply.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide substance to the skeletal structure of your plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's tempting to gloss over some details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now works as a night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the place one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. But remember, these details should be revealed gradually, naturally weaving into the fabric of the story, not dumped all at once.",
            "I monitored two broadcasts originating from Columbus, Ohio yesterday. The first was a live report on NBC 4 (August 13, 2011). The main news item featured a disturbance involving a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who allegedly stabbed his spouse. The victim's identity was withheld, but the suspect's image was broadcast. The report was concise, devoted barely two minutes to the unfolding case, yet I found it proportionate to the story's development. The second story involved an early morning shooting in Sharon Woods, leaving an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers, critically injured. No arrests were made, and the SWAT team was continuing the investigation. This story was brief, a situation I've observed with minority victims of crimes, who often receive less media attention compared to white victims.\n\nThe next segment covered a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the incident, as well as the caliber of the bullet, a .22 from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasts for Saturday afternoon's rain and thunderstorms were brief, designed to entice viewers to stay tuned. Another report discussed a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, involving a dark-skinned black man dressed in a hooded sweatshirt. His description included height and weight. I found the emphasis on his race unusual. The final story involved Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced for marijuana distribution. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, he was described as receiving \"300\" months. His ethnicity was also mentioned, which seemed unnecessary to the story.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, an unyielding force that encompasses a myriad of feelings: affection, admiration, envy, and even malice, among others. This bond is unique, allowing brothers to comprehend one another on a level that transcends ordinary relationships. When challenges arise, this bond reveals itself in its entirety, whether it’s in its positive or negative aspects. These emotions, when revealed, carry substantial weight. Understanding the emotions born from this sibling link involves grappling with the repercussions they bring. When one looks into their brother’s eyes, they see not just their own reflection, but their true essence. The actions and their outcomes define their genuine character. In the story “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers navigate this theme, along with the intense emotions that accompany it. Their journey unfolds amidst a vivid, richly described landscape. A bittersweet clash of disillusionment and immense pride unfolds in the pivotal scene, with only one brother emerging alive. This theme is conveyed through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which conveys the intricate emotions experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions can be distilled into a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could learn all his skills, such as “holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a companion who could join him in “racing to Horsehead Landing…and perching with him in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Alas, these aspirations were dashed by Doodle’s extreme heart condition, making it unlikely he would survive, let alone engage in strenuous activities. The disappointment was immense for the young protagonist, whose mind was filled with grand dreams. Even so, he harbored some anger towards the young child, contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. Such thoughts are chilling, but they melted away when Doodle smiled at him. This moment of hope showed that the protagonist’s resolve was not steadfast. Deep down, there was a natural affection for his brother.",
            "The human cerebrum is an intricate, imaginative data translator. As tech evolved from rudimentary to contemporary, the analogies invoked to depict the brain have similarly evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, subsequently to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As your understanding of the brain deepens, keep in mind that the utility of these metaphors is restricted and can lead to fallacies.\n\nData processing commences with input from the sensory organs, transmuting tangible stimuli such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. The sensory data is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down modes. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box against a white backdrop, bottom-up processing integrates simple data like hue, direction, and border placement – where hue shifts abruptly – to conclude that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing leverages decisions made at certain stages of the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might assist in identifying the object as a black box, not a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce data is partially processed, an attention sieve determines its significance and which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention sieve prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process data, it must first be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Each type of sensory stimulus has specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be sustained. Certain animal studies propose that working memory, which holds information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal cycling through a specific neuronal circuit for a brief duration. Data in long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved in the structure of particular proteins.\n\nNumerous models describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, some rooted in human memory retrieval, others in computer science, and others in neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, Brave New World, the author critically examines the encroaching dangers of technological advancements and the capitalist framework that underpins them. The society depicted in the novel values collective harmony over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The people are pawns in a larger scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, serving as a manifestation of Huxley's concerns about the rise of these systems. Through a Marxist lens, it is apparent that Huxley's novel is a critique of the burgeoning economic landscape of his time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common populace is deluded about their true economic standing. They are primarily concerned with personal gain, a result of ideological control by the ruling class. This is evident in Brave New World's portrayal of the lower classes, Delta and Gamma, who are conditioned to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one social class by another, is explicit in this context, with the lower classes unwittingly supporting the status quo of capitalism and consumerism. Even the upper classes, the Alphas and Betas, though aware, largely accept their station, with characters like Bernard being exceptions. The interactions between social classes, as will be elaborated upon, are telling indicators of perceived capitalist oppression.\n\nIn Brave New World, personal relationships are almost nonexistent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, hinting that technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and expression. Emotions are kept superficial, with men only commenting on women's physical attributes, and women discussing their encounters openly. This superficiality reflects the societal class structure's complacency, mirroring Marxist theories about the proletariat's false sense of superiority as long as they continue to consume and comply. Their unquestioning obedience to their position in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic impact of capitalism.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, translating to roughly four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge for many, including myself. Freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dorm, situated quite far eastward on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Journeying from Stuart Hall to classes in locations such as Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in State College's capricious weather. Engaging with an alum, I discovered that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated by vast tracts of unused land. Today, this expanse has evolved into sports fields, new structures like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartments. As our campus expands, traversing between locations becomes increasingly arduous. So, what's the ideal solution to campus mobility? Bicycles seem to be the answer. However, bicycles alone won't remedy the issue. Students must ride them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nSpeaking with a friend who recently resumed cycling after a hiatus, he mentioned, “Bikes are fantastic; for a while, they weren't cool, but they're the only feasible way to get around.” Besides being physically beneficial, bicycling is an efficient mode of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many peers, I now live off campus, equidistant from the campus center as some dorms. My wisest decision this year was investing in a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, can be reduced to 5 minutes by cycling swiftly. The primary challenge lies in Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, which isn't always smooth sailing. Walking is viable, but my schedule is too hectic to accommodate it. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That equates to over two and a half hours weekly, not to mention other instances of walking to classes, appointments, and more. That's time better spent elsewhere."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I aim to work within the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on supporting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and aiding troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, ethical integrity, dedication to fostering healthy relationships, and a commitment to continuous professional growth. These are not just professional tenets; they are deeply personal convictions.\n\nIn my high school and college years, I observed many individuals retreat from their challenges in denial or adopt unhelpful coping strategies. Inspired by these observations, I chose to study psychology, though I remained uncertain about my career path. Post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. During this time, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive home. To assist, I visited his parents' residence with the police. The parents' dismissive attitudes and defensive excuses prompted me to consider social work as a potential career path to aid children dealing with family conflict.\n\nSocial justice is another critical value in this field. Society often claims individual importance yet often conforms to traditional norms. I advocate for individuality and have protested injustices throughout my academic journey. I believe in fighting against racism, discrimination, and other social inequalities. My actions, such as unconventional fashion choices and involvement with GSBA, reflect my commitment to social justice.",
            "The subsequent paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives on the issue of insomnia. The Biological model concentrates on genetic attributes and health-related aspects, while the Sociocultural model explores environmental factors and how they relate to demographics, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into both models, selecting specific research to elucidate each and critiquing the findings for their respective strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be classified into three main types: primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental conditions, and those resulting from external factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Axis I or Axis II disorders, which are categorized under mental health conditions, can also cause sleep difficulties. Dyssomnias encompass conditions like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, while Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological disturbances during sleep. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with some consideration of their connection to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic makeup and physiological aspects. Orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus play a critical role in sleep-wake regulation. Research conducted on mice found that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons influence sleep and wakefulness. Activation of the GABAA receptor can promote sleep, whereas its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and promote sleep. The use of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in the mice study. This suggests that similar mechanisms may operate in humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for this receptor's function. However, a deficiency or dysfunction in this receptor could impair one's ability to sleep properly without medication. The Sociocultural implications of this research suggest that heritable phenotypes could naturally regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could disrupt sleep, thereby negatively affecting various aspects of life, such as education, work, and daily tasks requiring concentration.",
            "This essay will discuss three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). Initially, the disorder will be defined. Then, the process of diagnosis will be explained, highlighting typical indicators or \"red flags\". Lastly, the essay will explore strategies that a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can use to assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), can be defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In essence, it refers to the perceptual processing of sound in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underlies this processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. Simply put, it is a condition where the brain cannot correctly interpret sounds that are heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle with interpreting or differentiating between sounds, especially in noisy environments or when multiple sounds occur simultaneously.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that would later be known as CAPD comes from the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers, including an Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and later Kimura in 1961, began developing tests for children with communicative disorders. A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD can vary significantly. Individuals may have difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting sarcasm based on changes in voice, or understanding the sequence of auditory information. More severely affected individuals may have difficulty synthesizing sound clues or interpreting sounds in a meaningful way.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD typically involves a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills. These tests may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to specific auditory stimuli. There is currently no single, definitive test for diagnosis, and the exact cause of CAPD remains unknown. Many tests present the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli to evaluate their ability to differentiate items like numbers or words. More advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "The stagecraft of Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while donning disguises can facilitate prolonged deceptions, ultimately, one must shed these masks to avoid losing one's true self. However, concluding a deception can lead to feelings of isolation. The challenge lies in choosing between safeguarding one's identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may react indifferently to being deceived, others may feel affronted by the deception's artifice.\n\nThe theme of gender role reversal through deception raises complex questions, particularly concerning the motives behind adopting an opposite-gender guise. For Viola, her disguise is a means of self-preservation in an unfamiliar land. She initially succeeds in her ruse but finds herself estranged from her female peers, cutting off a crucial support network. Additionally, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and develop romantic feelings. “Where shall I go, my lord? Cesario, stay with me as my husband.” (5.1.138) Moreover, Viola must navigate suppressed romantic interests, namely with Orsino: “Boy, you've told me a thousand times that you should not love a woman like me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nThis perspective, though somewhat progressive, may seem problematic to modern audiences. Twelfth Night could be seen as demonstrating how deception can help release hidden emotions, notably in Olivia and Orsino's cases. It's possible that their feelings for Cesario/Viola bring to light unacknowledged desires they've suppressed. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of his male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? This scenario seems unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to judge others based on their appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, regarding Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a romantic interest: “You are my sister.” (5.1.315)",
            "The harsh nature of German colonial rule cannot be ignored, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. The complexity of colonial rule across German colonies is significant, exhibiting diverse policies and governance. Educational initiatives varied widely. Upon seizing German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British encountered a populace with substantial levels of education and literacy. Similarly, contemporary accounts praised educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies. In stark contrast, South West Africa (today's Namibia) presented a markedly different scenario. While East Africa saw government-run state schools and substantial native education, South West Africa relied heavily on missionary societies with limited government backing. The colonial government, however, invested considerably in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools rigorously. These educational policies had enduring impacts on South West Africa, even post-German rule. Unlike other German colonies, South West Africa saw the majority of its population remain uneducated and illiterate due to a variety of social, political, and economic factors. This thesis aims to delve into these factors, focusing on recent research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German, originating from the early 20th century, coinciding with or immediately following German rule. Early works often described educational systems in these colonies. Later English publications expanded on this, offering comparative studies and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted notable differences in educational systems across colonies. Cohen's work, which compares education in South West Africa and East Africa, is particularly relevant to this study. Cohen attributes many distinctions in South West Africa's educational system to its large settler population.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, though much of the territory was arid desert. This climate influenced the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to approximately 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the last century, encompassing numerous genres that can be challenging to enumerate entirely. Further complicating this, most genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—have birthed numerous sub and sub-sub genres within their domains. Notably, Heavy Metal rock, emerging in the past four decades, has become one of the most multifaceted and expressive genres in popular music. Its expressiveness stems from its broad emotional spectrum, albeit leaning towards darker emotions. It is also characterized by its diversity, with early adopters recognizing its flexibility and subsequently developing various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nIn contemporary heavy metal, the multitude of niche sub-genres has made it difficult to pinpoint the exact essence of heavy metal. It has absorbed elements from various other genres, yet it has its roots in a specific origin. To comprehend the vast landscape of metal music today, one must first understand the metal movement and its distinction from a traditional genre.\n\nMetal can be seen as a movement defined by its darker themes. It is often referred to as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, louder volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. It is less primitive and more technically proficient, with band members exhibiting impressive musical skills. Additionally, metal is renowned for its association with drug experimentation. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s led to artists creating wild, otherworldly music, using drugs as an inspiration. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, which were not previously prominent in popular music. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, exemplify the darker themes prevalent in metal. This song is considered one of the earliest heavy metal tracks and was a response to a similarly darker song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles aimed to prove they could match the Stones' heavier, darker style by including it in their album The White Album.",
            "Years prior to the Surrealists' dream-inspired paintings, artist Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both in reality and imagination. The Dream, painted in 1910, does not merely depict a woman enthralled by her dreamt landscape but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations. From the outset of his work, he envisioned recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, grappling with an internal conflict to attain this goal. This struggle is epitomized in The Dream, where Rousseau must choose between conforming to established styles for acceptance or forging his own unique artistic path.\n\nTo comprehend The Dream, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's life. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a prosperous tinsmith and hardware merchant. Raised without formal artistic training, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until his late forties. Widowed and grieving the loss of eight infant children and his first wife, Clémence, he turned to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike his peers who idealized rural life, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of his lower-class peers.\n\nRousseau's desire for art world acceptance is understandable given his background. Unlike his contemporaries, he had no formal training and began his career later in life, competing with renowned artists like Matisse. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that Matisse, driven by a fear of clichés, and Rousseau, seeking conventional recognition, were both driven by different motivations. \"Matisse, driven by a fear of painting tritely, while Rousseau's desire was to paint conventionally to be admitted to the Artiste Français,\" Gordon states.",
            "Numerous philosophers have posited an intrinsic bond between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I contend that this connection stems from a profound source. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience. Yet, we often find ourselves appreciating ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics strive to explain, rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty are typically attempts to elucidate why something is beautiful or moral, not to establish rules for judgment or creation.\n\nTake, for instance, the criticism of art or morals. A discourse on the worth of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might involve concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but fundamentally, these do not encapsulate why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, we often hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding more detailed explanations. I argue that both art and morals cannot be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics shares this transcendent essence. As Wittgenstein notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I posit that this ineffable \"something\" is the most potent attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that forges a connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely intertwined because we experience them most profoundly at a noumenal level, to borrow a Kantian term. They impact us at an experiential depth that transcends explanation. This bond is particularly evident in the art of literature. As McKean contends, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inapplicable to other arts, such as music, but they seem as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is significant to us precisely because of the values we encounter there.\"",
            "The modern-day Germany is regarded as a formidable nation, a unified entity possessing a vibrant cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is palpable in Cologne along the River Rhine, through the heart of the country, and into the Saxon city of Dresden, situated on the Elbe. Such a rich cultural landscape is a testament to Germany's diverse origins, stemming from various tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins are hotly debated among scholars and historians. Some attribute it to a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in warfare against the Gauls, as documented by Tacitus in 98 AD. Others propose the name comes from a spear used in battle, called a \"ger,\" or possibly from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' prowess in warfare. Julius Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, employs the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et Situe Germani,\" describes the Germans as indigenous and unadulterated, having migrated via sea rather than land. He queries why one would choose to move from Asia or Africa to Germany, given its harsh climate and people's sullen demeanor. The Romans, facing these hardy Germanic tribes on their empire's periphery, primarily engaged in trade and occasional skirmishes, with Germanic warriors often serving in the Roman army. As the first century drew to a close, these tribes began appearing in large numbers, living on the empire's borders and exchanging goods and skills.",
            "A gaze downwards, mind hollow and attentive, took in the scene before me. Coldly, silently, with a trained detachment, I observed the subject of study, an object that my mind processed but refused to connect to any abstract comprehension. Ideas flitted in and out of my consciousness, so swiftly and seamlessly that it seemed I had no genuine thoughts of my own, merely a fluid and dynamic experience of what lay before my eyes.\n\nOnce, driven by an artist’s recommendation, I bought a drawing manual titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" My fascination with drawing began at the age of six, and this book teaches everything from understanding the basics of a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. A method the book advocates is to frame any image with a square, thus simplifying overwhelming detail and isolating the focus.\n\nIn that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't impose such a frame. I was too engrossed, too captivated to do more than gaze in awe. Masters like Picasso, Monet, and the Italian Renaissance painters had their unique styles, and here was the beginning of my own work, a potential masterpiece in brown.\n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and released as my hand moved through space, my mind giving form to creativity. Water swirled serene and clear. Matter broke away and disappeared. Muscles twitched faster, anxiety rising as I hit the toilet handle again. The brown package refused to budge, stuck like a slug.\n\nGripping the mop loosely, feet wide apart, tie knotted tightly around my throat, I scowled at the mess. A few more flushes, a few moments of reflection, and my hand reached for the toilet paper sheet. It was wrapped around my hand like an oven mitt. Straightening up, bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother reaching into an oven for Thanksgiving dinner….",
            "Adolescents are perishing at the wheel. A confluence of factors engenders this grim reality for our youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that one aspect of the problem lies in the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not yet adept at coping with the perils of driving. Add to this the compounding factor of inexperience, which not only elevates the incidence of fatal crashes but also aggravates the risk of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens, in particular, are more vulnerable when accompanied by their peers, a behavior that, as is well-known, is commonplace among them. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. California and other states have implemented measures such as temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these provisional licenses are, in my view, merely a temporary solution. The underlying issue is that, collectively, young drivers are statistically unfit to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman posits that even 18 years old may be too youthful for a standard driver’s license. USA Today reports Zuckerman’s research indicating a pronounced inclination among those under the age of 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behaviors. Therefore, it seems logical to postpone driving until this inclination subsides. If we persist in granting driver’s licenses to adolescents, we can anticipate an escalating number of deadly accidents. By 2010, the baby boomers' children will reach driving age, and millions of new adolescent drivers will be ready to hit the road. Legislation addressing this issue could be fairly straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver’s education classes, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full driver’s license, with a predetermined number of practical driver training hours required, based on the majority of states’ current standards. Since these grim statistics span all states, a uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and potentially effective means of safeguarding teens across the nation. The legislation I propose is not an untested concept.",
            "Diving into the treasures of the Library of Congress's early Edison film archive, I stumbled upon fifteen trick films crafted between 1895 and 1901. These films exploit clever editing to create optical illusions. My analysis primarily delved into the poetic elements that underpin most trick films, while also scrutinizing the peculiarities in a handful of later films. The trick films of that era are typically confined within a static proscenium, using long and medium shots, and adhering to a one-shot-per-film philosophy. However, a few daring innovators began to experiment with multiple shots early in the 20th century.\n\nA distinctive feature of these trick films is their filming within a static stage setting, visualized through a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed, not moving to track figures or objects. This static approach was common in early cinema, drawing inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. Trick films, in particular, often mirror vaudeville magic acts, where performers move side-to-side, but never approach or leave the camera. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). Actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the stage, with the camera never following their action.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style often results in long and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from these films, reflecting the theatre tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance. Actors typically remain in the mid-ground, avoiding close-ups. This one-shot-per-film standard limited most trick films to a minute or less in length, and their content to short vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, it's essential to note that the one-shot concept is deceptive; a single \"shot\" can comprise multiple joined segments to create illusions like apparitions or disappearances. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a close look reveals the transition where Mary's head appears to be severed, despite the film feeling like one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, a resident of Caroline, was an early and enthusiastic advocate of Republicanism. Despite his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and brief tenure in politics, his commitment to personal liberty and governance was evident. His dedication to an agrarian lifestyle significantly influenced his views on governance, with his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system being heavily rooted in this belief. Taylor sought to preserve and promote what he considered the superior career, thereby coloring his arguments on these matters. He posited that the United States had the unique opportunity to establish an ideal governance system due to the absence of native traditions that could hinder such a creation, allowing for a system of self-government. Taylor strongly believed in the interconnectedness of natural rights, asserting that if any right is denied, others are weakened in value. He argued that these rights should be immune to government intervention. He contended that the \"state of nature\" denoted the dominance of individuals with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence, but that in a civilized society, this should not be the case. To create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that recognized both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He was steadfast in his dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, likely led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, is a natural human trait, but it becomes evil when it leads to sub-societies that exploit others. A good government is necessary to control this inherent evil, and even then, it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles. Taylor, like many of his Republican contemporaries, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, favoring a minimal Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could become oppressive due to its expense, but believed a literal interpretation without consideration of the writers' intent could lead to corruption. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting the data from Figure 17, a significant plunge in commuter log submissions was noted during the third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and the root cause remains unclear. The onset of winter in a New England setting likely contributed to a drop in those commuting via bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December marks the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with wrapping up coursework and grading. The commuter log submission process may have been inadvertently overlooked due to these distractions. Furthermore, December's busy holiday season culminates in a one-month break, with many not needing to visit campus during this period. The restart of classes in late January may also account for the low log submissions. However, the February dip remains unexplained. It is conceivable that any such project experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a natural decline. To boost engagement, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which indeed led to an uptick in log submissions. Thus, maintaining project traction amidst declining engagement and semester breaks was a major hurdle. Another obstacle was the deeply ingrained preference for driving, which is a significant part of our culture. To incentivize alternative commuting modes, we offered a variety of rewards, including gift certificates to local businesses. It would have been intriguing to assess the impact of larger prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car. If the prize values had increased over time, engagement may have improved.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument that tracks an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, akin to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility as it trades on an exchange like a stock. This type of fund provides the diversification of an index fund along with the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and purchase as few as one share. Despite these alluring benefits, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. However, a key drawback is the necessity to pay a commission for each trade, similar to stock transactions. Furthermore, the extensive range of available funds offers a variety of options. Nonetheless, it is essential for astute investors to assess whether the touted benefits, such as diversification, genuinely exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will scrutinize the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to determine if holding a single ETF can approximate the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, as well as to ascertain if there are more optimal configurations of these stocks to enhance the Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nConsidering the impracticality of including every holding, we have elected to focus on the top ten holdings, which constitute 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of these top holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we will normalize the current percentages of assets to 100% and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio comprises only these ten stocks in the proportion held by the ETF. The Beta and Return calculations are shown in the table beneath.\n\nFrom the table, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. Based on these findings, a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, the statistical significance of this difference remains to be determined.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% for a comparative assessment of their combined standard deviation in relation to the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's more notable compositions, \"Dream-Land,\" is often considered one of his finest works. Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference traceable to Virgil, who utilized it in relation to an island north of Britain, deemed the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, another source merits consideration. Poe's interest in German authors is well-documented, making the connection to Goethe plausible.\nThis connection bears significance as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarity between the two poets' works, suggesting Poe was inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe is renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of Faust, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" appears, detailing a king whose wife's death following a gift of a goblet leads to his own demise, marked by heavy drinking and despair. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with the latter's speaker sharing a similar state of melancholy and despair.\nPoe's references to Thule are not isolated. He uses the term \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employs \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land\" as bookends to the poem. This suggests a deliberate echoing of \"The King of Thule.\" The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a dark, lonely landscape, haunted by the specters of dead friends, and a world lacking color—scenes that resonate with the despair of Goethe's king. The poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" functioning as a direct interpretation of Goethe's poem. Poe's admiration for Tennyson further strengthens the connection, as he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through Tennyson's influence and the numerous reproductions of Goethe's works in his time.",
            "In accordance with California law, would it be feasible for a patron who suffered an injury after slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket to secure punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager's inaction was motivated by malice? A judge may hesitate to summarily reject Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim. To establish a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were intentional and included a disregard for the probable harm, as well as evidence of conduct that is considered despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of leaving the spill uncleaned, given the multiple incidents at D&D involving customers slipping in the months prior to her accident. While her argument regarding despicable conduct might be less convincing, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents reported in 2009 with no appropriate actions taken for safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, an employee of D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to address customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. At 5:30 PM on the same day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of obligation not stemming from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct aiming to cause harm, or, lacking intent, with a \"willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when committed with a disregard for a plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Four years ago, I engaged in a course on Islam at CBC. The class frequently debated whether Islam is inherently hostile, a discourse that seems more pertinent today than ever. Since the events of 9/11, I've noticed a shift in media perception, moving from a hostile stance towards extremism to a hyper-tolerant view of Islam. In 2001, it's doubtful a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his evident Muslim background, could have been conceived.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography captivates me, yet it diverges from my understanding of Muhammad. Historical accounts depict him as a conqueror, forcing tribes to adopt Islam. In contrast, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly awaiting converts. This discrepancy suggests a narrative intent to elevate Muhammad without necessitating miracles or proof.\n\nMoreover, parallels drawn between Jesus and Muhammad's ministries, such as the multiplication of food, create an impression of Muhammad as a humble prophet. This approach appears to diminish Jesus' life and miracles, potentially appropriating His legacy for Muhammad.\n\nSeveral tales in the biography present a third-party perspective, replicating a chain of hearsay: \"So-and-so heard from so-and-so...\" While intended to validate stories, this method diminishes their credibility.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the glorification of Muhammad as a gentle, wise, and humble figure, despite historical evidence contradicting this image. If Muslims today were aware of Muhammad's true ascension to power, it might challenge their perception of him.",
            "The message and convictions espoused by Jesus during his tenure on Earth seemed to be swiftly eclipsed, as the evolving landscape of Christian thought diverged progressively from its roots. A cursory examination of this trajectory reveals a trend where Christianity has steadily distanced itself from its inception. In our contemporary world, there is an evident growth in awareness and a burgeoning progressive mindset. However, it's important to acknowledge that those who cling to traditional teachings may not be a predominant force. In the future, there will likely be a surge in historical consciousness among Christians, a desire to delineate between the doctrines appended over time and the genuine intent of Christianity's namesake. This process may take generations, but the ultimate outcome is unavoidable: a significant shift back to Christianity's original form. A movement will emerge, systematically stripping away superfluous doctrines, akin to rewinding time, until what remains is an unadulterated version of Jesus' teachings, untainted by subsequent thought leaders. As this change sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses to practice as they did in Jesus' time, the church will persist as a guiding force. Yet, due to this theological regression, the previously rampant diversity in Christian thought and practice will give way to increasing uniformity. Regional, denominational, and factional differences will yield to similarities. Throughout history, such reversals have occurred. Once shunned and persecuted, Christians were later adopted by the Roman Empire. Similarly, our nation has transitioned from oppressing to uplifting African Americans. The impending reversal in Christian history will mirror these changes, seeking the original source and reducing diversity in the process. A key factor in this will be a shift in interpreting Jesus' words as symbolic rather than literal. So, what transpired following Jesus' lifetime?\nIf we peer deeply into the past, we find Judaism, the foundational theology of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the supremacy of Hebrew scriptures were core to this religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. This Jewish population was not united but divided into various factions, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common folk.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" presents a chilling portrait of human nature, revealing the innate greed and selfishness that drives individuals to prioritize personal gain over the well-being of others. The narrative exemplifies this through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who seek to expand their empires with unyielding determination, disregarding the collateral damage caused by their relentless pursuit. Sinclair vividly illustrates the environmental fallout, with \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the callous indifference towards pollution and its consequences. The owners' disregard for their employees is equally evident, with \"So from the top to the bottom, the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar,\" showcasing the exploitative nature of their operations. The lack of worker protections during this period enabled this cruel exploitation, forcing employees to toil in deplorable conditions and face sudden dismissals without compensation or support. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were as much victims of servitude as those in chattel slavery, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Various writers implement distinctive methods to evoke specific emotions or sentiments in their readers concerning pivotal themes. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques in his literary work, \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create an atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns significance to symbols, utilizing them for similar purposes. This latter technique is frequently employed by Fitzgerald, particularly with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald elaborates on the symbolic meaning of these colors and later employs this meaning to remind readers of certain feelings regarding important elements.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity involves assigning white a higher, more refined connotation, and gray a more dated, faded one. This is established early in the novel through repeated mentions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white,\" as are Nick's attire at Gatsby's party, Tom's shirt during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine's powdered milky complexion. White/gray uniformity is further emphasized by the color of less significant subjects and characters: Nick encounters \"the white chasms of lower New York\" on his way to work, and at Gatsby’s parties, names are \"gray\" on Nick's schedule. Additionally, Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" and plain or ordinary people are described as white or gray, such as the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child, and the \"gray old man\" dog-seller.\n\nHaving instilled the meaning of white/gray in these ways, Fitzgerald uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity in characters and objects. This strategy begins with Daisy, who is described in white after a period of significant absence from the narrative, making her appear less like a developed character and more like a uniform addition desired by Gatsby. This technique is reinforced with repeated use of white and gray around Daisy, such as her fur collar described as \"a gray haze\" and her attire in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "The county of San Diego boasts a thriving agricultural landscape, bolstered by its temperate, sun-drenched environment. The region's crops are diverse, encompassing tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic, locally sourced produce is robust, with numerous community-supported agriculture programs featuring extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk also enjoy high popularity. Many organic farms offer immersive tours and recreational experiences, such as hiking and birdwatching, while integrating government programs to maximize both financial benefits and ecological preservation.\n\nOrganic farming, despite being more labor-intensive and costly than conventional methods, offers the advantage of increased biodiversity and a healthier environment due to the absence of chemicals. However, it faces challenges such as higher labor and management costs, potential yield losses, and a lack of operational scale efficiency. Beyond organic farming practices, additional wildlife-friendly measures may further escalate labor costs, including planting cover crops, managing grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth for specific ecological conditions.\n\nThe selected property is a 160-acre parcel located near the town of Potrero, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This area is home to various plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or at risk, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. The land, previously inhabited by Native Americans and later used for cattle ranching and wood production, is currently under review for its conservation potential.\n\nI selected this property from an online real estate listing and explored various government programs to assist small farmers in cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a hypothetical model, I identified an organic farm in the same area to illustrate what a landowner might strive to achieve.",
            "The role of culture in negotiations is multifaceted and profound. Culture, in essence, can be understood as much by what it excludes as what it includes, and the meaning it conveys. It is neither uniform nor monolithic. Stereotypes such as \"all Germans are punctual\" or \"all French are romantic\" oversimplify and generalize cultural nuances. While understanding these generalizations is useful, a negotiator should focus on the specific cultural context and its impact on discussions. Encountering a foreign culture often leads to comparisons with one's own, but true comprehension involves studying history, recognizing biases, and embracing rather than altering it. In negotiations, particularly when one holds a less advantageous position, understanding and respecting the local culture can break down barriers and advance the dialogue.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that corporate culture, too, can vary widely, regardless of national boundaries. Within a single country, companies may promote different work environments, from long hours to flexible schedules. Observing employee attire, communication styles, and hiring practices can reveal a company's cultural identity. For example, some businesses promote employee philanthropy broadly, while others restrict it to approved causes. Even within the United States, corporate cultures can vary greatly, from coast to coast and across urban and suburban regions. Some cultures appear more homogeneous, but a deeper dive is necessary to uncover their true complexity.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally, if not more, important. Values provide the motivation behind a culture's actions. If preserving face or maintaining harmony is valued, a negotiator would avoid public confrontation to achieve success. Conversely, a culture valuing aggressive bargaining might not settle quickly. Recognizing these values before negotiations begins is essential, but personal insights into the opponent's background can also enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The quote, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" appears initially in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is the opening of St. Anselm’s argument for the existence of God. Aquinas, another notable figure, shares a similar stance, and our task is to appraise the strength of their arguments. To simplify our comparison, we'll assume both belief in the Bible's God is valid. An alternative divine figure might hinder our assessment, as their arguments focus on this specific concept. Both authors shed light on noteworthy points, though neither argument fully substantiates God's existence.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument hinges on introspection. He posits that God's existence is evident within our understanding, necessitating no external evidence. This idea, though somewhat convoluted, posits that God's proof lies within our minds. This is akin to the Christian principle of faith, accepting truths without definitive empirical proof.\n\nContrasting Aquinas, he insists God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This would aid evangelism by persuading through logic alone. Aquinas presents five arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each underscoring the logical necessity of God. If given a puzzle with one missing piece, logical deduction dictates knowing its features without seeing it directly.",
            "Around the midpoint of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a royal figure destined to be revered as Buddha came into being. Throughout his life, he chose to forsake worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, giving birth to Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being Theravada. This ancient faith is nearing its twenty-fifth century, and its appearance today is vastly different from its origins. For example, in the Theravada-majority nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ritual is observed. Participants, be they monks or laypeople, engage in this ritual, underscoring its religious significance, despite Buddha never having advocated any such celebration. These discrepancies span from outward traditions to the religion’s core tenets. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from the monastic or secular vantage, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both external and internal factors, both hostile and amicable.\nIn this discourse, certain pivotal terms will be frequently employed. Internal forces are defined as those stemming from the Buddha's teachings, regardless of one's role within the community. External forces encompass influences from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, conversely, do not aim to cause harm or aid the community, though their outcomes may vary.\nTo commence, let us examine Buddhism's foundational principles. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, essentially, comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka encompasses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is crucial for escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, along with its associated passions—lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion)—upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes life rules, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct, and not ingesting intoxicants), and monks observing many more rules. The most fundamental Buddhist doctrine is the four noble truths. Life is marked by suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes this suffering, and it can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, a period marked by significant tension and conflict. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. This was part of a broader series of disputes between the two nations, many of which were rooted in cultural, religious, and economic differences, as well as territorial claims and border issues (Diehl & Goerts, 2000, p. 145). Comparably, other neighboring nations have also experienced enduring rivalries due to shared borders and differing interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that only Mexico and Cuba had persistent, overarching American diplomatic issues, largely due to their geographical proximity and historical rivalries (p. 41). religious differences were a significant factor, with Americans often opposing Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring the ideological struggles of the Cold War but focused on religious preferences rather than political structure (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). These historical and cultural animosities, inherited from their former colonial rulers, posed substantial challenges to forming amicable relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes during this rivalry, most of which were territorial in nature, involving border raids and frontier issues that persisted until both countries deployed military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, marking a shift from territorial expansion to economic intervention as a primary concern for the United States in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years past, I was unexpectedly disabled by an affliction I had not previously known existed. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession due to an ingrained need for security and stability that my childhood lacked. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" was the refrain I heard as I grew into adolescence and beyond. Thus, despite my dreams of becoming a scientist or journalist, I found myself in nursing. Yet here I was: 46 years old, unmarried, penniless, and unable to work. Disability has been my companion for 15 years, and after living on Social Security Disability, I find myself with nothing truly mine. Life has been a constant struggle, an assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty permeates every aspect of my life, but one truth remains certain: I could not have persevered without my family's assistance and the kindness of a few friends. When disaster strikes, you realize just how vulnerable you truly are.\n\nMy message is that life is fraught with emergencies, big and small. There's no absolute security, and no amount of preparation can mitigate everything. While I agree that we should not rely solely on government, I believe we should foster trust and mutual support among Americans. The Conservatives often tout the \"rugged individualism\" that supposedly built this nation, but it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that sustained our forefathers during hard times. Pioneers crossing the Rockies did not achieve their goal alone.\n\nSo, I strongly advise: be prepared. I have disaster supplies, including a first aid kit, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for windows. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the means, consider farming and preserving food. However, while preparing, don't forget to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do remains intriguing. Are there inherent constraints steering the path of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson in 1917 opined that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, the same sentiment holds true today. Recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to mollusk skeletogenesis through both developmental and evolutionary contexts. Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of Prunum, augmented by experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes. Utilizing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies in CerioShell software. These models help interpret the limits of possible morphological transformations in Prunum, complementing experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events.\n\nA shell, fundamentally, is a spiraling tube traversing 360 degrees of space. These revolutions, or coils, are termed whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, demarcated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest coil, termed the body whorl, is the last. The spire comprises all whorls except the last, with the apex being the spire's tip and the base its opposite end. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends from its shell.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"standard\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical position and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell, then count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl as necessary.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The aperture’s trajectory can be tracked via coordinates of each whorl's center and the aperture’s horizontal and vertical radii. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied to alter mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesian neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little to no improvement over the past decade, despite the nation's progress in meeting various Millennium Development Goals such as clean water and sanitation. However, the enhancements needed for child and maternal health to meet the 2015 targets remain elusive. The underlying causes for this plight—including the prominence of traditional birth attendants and inadequate postnatal care—suggest a need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than singular programmatic initiatives.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed an increase in births attended by skilled personnel, reaching 72%. Nevertheless, this figure encompasses traditional birth attendants like midwives who lack the capacity to handle complicated pregnancies, resulting in a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Furthermore, there's a decline in the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea, and the postnatal care data reveals widespread concern.\n\nCesarean-section rates, currently at around 4%, fall short of expectations, with a stark contrast between urban (7%) and rural (2%) settings, indicating discrepancies in healthcare access. This disparity in service utilization is also evident between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap, suggesting that the impoverished face significant barriers to healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal healthcare, the critical question is how to best address the dearth of services. Should Indonesia adopt targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen the entire healthcare system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care? Vertical programs, which concentrate on improving one sector, offer targeted and manageable goals with quicker results. However, these targeted approaches can lead to resource depletion in other sectors, cause duplication of services, and increase administrative burdens due to uncoordinated programs.",
            "Victorian literature is distinguished by its meticulous attention to detail, with a particular focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, there are exceptions to this norm, such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works incorporate elements of mystery and the peculiar, which are uncommon in typical Victorian literature, thereby enhancing the characters and providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“A swarm of bewildering and perplexing ideas invaded his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were fervently arguing: for the very words they uttered echoed in his ears, and when he attempted to focus, he discovered he was conversing with them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; and amidst a flurry of shrieks and shouts, blinding lights, and chaotic noise, an unseen entity swiftly carried him away. Through this whirlwind of visions, there lingered an indistinct, unsettling awareness of pain, which gnawed and tormented him unceasingly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels employ mystery primarily through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with the content and purpose varying in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil aspects of Oliver's inner self, his anguish, and his understanding of the true nature of his surroundings. Upon revisiting the shooting of Oliver in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the dire state of his health, which was evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelmed him, numbing all his senses and leaving him unaware of the \"unseen hand\" that bore him away; he experienced his despair anew, removed from the shock of pain, with the pain now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. Given Oliver's overwhelmed state, the question arises whose will brought about his misfortune, as it could hardly have been his own. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his circumstances, even when his life is at stake. A sense of desolation in Oliver is also implied, as if the influence of old Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and impacting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day faded, or at least it seemed to. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it arrived – and night descended, a night that seemed endless, yet fleeting; long in its dreadful silence and short in its hasty flight.”",
            "Several years ago, I was an assistant in an after-school program, assisting elementary-aged students with their academic needs. My forte was in English and reading, but I was asked by a colleague to aid a young boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty with reading. His circumstances were puzzling; he could pronounce certain letters accurately, while others were completely off. Despite his Latino heritage, he spoke flawless English, which seemed contradictory. After some time, I met Adrian's mother, who communicated solely in Spanish, despite my rudimentary Spanish skills. It became evident that Adrian could read but struggled with the English alphabet and its pronunciation. This revelation, while not solving his problems, was a key insight into the language barrier many students face.\n\nThis anecdote highlights the complexity of language barriers in educational settings, particularly in California. It underscores how seemingly fluent English speakers can encounter significant hurdles in reading. The challenge is evident, but the solutions are multifaceted. For some, like Adrian, additional tutoring in English reading, especially focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations, may suffice. For others, particularly those with limited English proficiency, the solutions are more intricate.\n\nThe dual language system, which involves educating students in both their native language and English, is a promising approach. It has been proven to improve academic performance for bilingual students. However, implementing this system universally is not without its challenges. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical, employing bilingual aides or tutors can offset this. The key lies in integrating various strategies, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes, to create a comprehensive solution.",
            "From a tender age, humans are often introduced to the notion of something larger than ourselves, a concept that we cannot fully grasp or understand. Some are indoctrinated into religious institutions, while others seek guidance from within or explore various spiritual paths. Many embrace the faith instilled in them by their forebears, while others vehemently reject it, asserting that the world ends at their own personal experiences. Our journeys to define our selves are colored by our unique interpretations of spirituality, a search for illumination in the darkness to guide us towards enlightenment.\n\n“Redbirds,” my dad said casually when I inquired about his preferred aviary. We sat on the front porch, the rain's steady rhythm drumming against the metallic roof above, as we shared smokes. The downspouts channeled the water, drenching the flora around us. His gaze was distant, as if lost in contemplation and memory. He appeared gaunt, his clothes loose and his hair thinner than I recalled. His eyes avoided mine. I felt isolated, anxious, and unable to discuss with him the impending loss that would intensify our reality. I embraced him, resuming my seat closer to his, and joined him in contemplating the rain’s descent in the June twilight.\n\nMy father bid his last farewell in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The medical interventions had prolonged his suffering but prolonged his life a few additional months beyond what the physicians had anticipated; the value, however, remained elusive. What deity would inflict such pain? I questioned in solitude. In the darkness, I offered no supplications. If such a being existed, I believed it had ceased listening to me long before.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passage from this life to another. Thus, I did not bear witness. I did not desire to observe the life that had given me life as it faded. I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died.

I curled into a fetal position in my bed for three days, waiting for the inevitable.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" labeled an \"Old-New oxymoron\" by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has faced varied criticism and commendation. Praised for its 'terrible sublime' and derided for its lack of depth, the Gothic mode has been a staple of literary discourse since its inception. Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a seminal work in the genre, blended ancient and modern romance elements to birth the proto-Gothic. Integrating old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature, Walpole presented a novel with a unique narrative structure, allowing readers an intimate glimpse into characters' psyches. The Gothic genre, steeped in medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, fascinated readers despite its archaic reputation. The fusion of these elements with the novel form allowed Gothic literature to persist over time, acting as both a relic of the past and a fresh exploration for later audiences.\n\nOne significant theme prevalent in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideals of chivalry, depicted in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, remain central to the genre. Chivalry appealed to Gothic writers, who sought to romanticize a bygone era they viewed as superior to their contemporary society. Walpole's personal political turmoil may have influenced his portrayal of society's moral decline, as evident in characters like Frederic. Although Frederic embodies classic chivalric traits, his depiction hints at Walpole's despair over societal moral decay. Frederic's description illustrates these themes, with Walpole emphasizing the prince's chivalric qualities, such as his status, tragic past, and imminent demise at the hands of infidels.",
            "Supply chain orchestration, a process that involves the movement of goods from the moment of customer order to the point where raw materials are transformed into end products and distributed to the customer, is a critical function in business operations. The concept was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive approach to planning, executing, and supervising the supply chain to meet customer demands swiftly and effectively. This system is composed of six fundamental elements: production, procurement, inventory, location, logistics, and information. These elements are utilized by business managers to deliver superior customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain process is production. This is the cornerstone of the entire system. Production determines the timing, purpose, location, and methodology of creating goods. Managers must comprehend customer preferences to make informed decisions. By examining market trends, managers can discern customer demands. With a clear understanding of customer needs, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. Post-decision, managers must select suitable production sites that balance volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. The subsequent focus is on workload scheduling and equipment upkeep. Production is a pivotal step; meticulous planning is essential to avoid delays and financial losses. For instance, I've worked in retail environments like Wal-Mart and Target, where each operation follows a structured plan, from uniform design to receiving shipments. These plans ensure smooth operations and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key factor in supply chain management is procurement. Procurement involves strategic decisions that define a facility's core capabilities and partnerships. A single product may require multiple production units, each with unique equipment, personnel, and specialties. Managers must select the most suitable division for various product processes. Outsourcing may also be an option to enhance velocity, which is the capacity to deliver high-quality, flexible products at reduced costs or sustained low prices.",
            "A peculiar sign reads: \"Adolf Hitler lives in Myanmar.\" Ellen Page, renowned for her role in ‘Juno’, stands solitary on a city corner, holding a makeshift placard with the chilling message scrawled in marker. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation governed by a dictatorial military council since 1962, has a history of suppressing dissent. In 2007, monks sparked street protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution,\" that grew as masses joined in. Initially tolerating these peaceful gatherings, the regime escalated to violent crackdowns, invading monasteries and imprisoning foreign journalists, with a photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fatally shot on September 27th, 2007. Officials claim 13 deaths, but defector Colonel Hla Win estimates thousands more.\n\nThis isn't novel; history is replete with rulers seeking total control. Ancient Roman emperors, Japanese emperors, and even current US presidents have had similar aspirations. Notable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the government's fatality estimates range from 200 to 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia and the Rwandan government killed Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, a period spanning several years and countries, saw the systematic murder of Jews.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on the landscape of jazz is marked by his enduring tenacity and profound creativity in guiding his orchestra. Ellington's piano presence in many of the pieces chosen for this examination is often understated, yet his prowess as a composer shines through as he fashions intricate compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington's genius lies in his ability to craft a framework that permits soloists to improvise freely, while also penning tightly structured arrangements and phrases that amplify the distinct styles of his players, creating harmonious and original sounds that complement each piece. The Grove Music dictionary attests to Ellington's sound and innovation, noting his pioneering use of voice as an instrument in \"Creole Love Call.\" This early piece showcases Ellington's adeptness at incorporating vocal textures and colors without the burden of lyrics, as well as his capacity to harmonize with the style of his soloists throughout his career. \"Creole Love Call\" is a 12-bar blues composition that unfolds over six choruses, each presenting a unique interplay between voice and instruments:\n\n- Chorus 1: A smooth, melodic vocal response, transitioning to a rougher sound midway.\n- Chorus 2: Muted trumpet solo, elaborating on the theme with extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: Soaring clarinet solo in the upper register, supported by a subtle, syncopated piano line.\n- Chorus 4: Full ensemble echo of the first chorus, with brass and reed sections engaging in a call and response.\n- Chorus 5: A climactic chorus, with reeds leading a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the initial structure, with the voice adopting a growling technique to solo as an instrument.\n\n\"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, exemplifies Ellington's skill in tight orchestration and his ear for tone color. Here, a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing merges the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. Ellington's masterful use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these techniques, with Nanton introducing the melody to great effect.\n\nEllington's consistent use of voices to enrich the tonal palette of his compositions is a recurring theme in his work.",
            "An insatiable sense of yearning had been her constant companion since she was 14. This unquenched desire, now three years later, at 17, had shifted from a material need to a more personal one. Yet, no suitor had piqued her interest. Boys had courted her, but none sparked her curiosity or affections. This enigma baffled her, and years of introspection had yielded only theories that left her unsatisfied. Despite this inner turmoil, she lived her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nA typical day at home was usually tranquil. Her parents, serene individuals, rarely clashed with each other or their daughter. Their only discord was her independent streak. The only child of calm parents, she was known for her liveliness and kindness.\n\nToday, however, serenity eluded her. As she traversed the house seeking inspiration, her mother's anguished cry echoed from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic rising as she cried, \"Mom?! Mom, what happened?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, breathless and in pain. She knelt by her side, offering assistance. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The urgency in her mother's voice conveyed her agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother guided her, and the daughter's training in physical strength proved invaluable as she carried her mother to the car.\n\nThe hospital's familiar scents of antiseptic and fear filled the air, but her mother's wellbeing consumed her thoughts. She rushed her mother in and called for help. Doctors swiftly appeared, wheeling her mother away. Left alone, she worried, her mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a high cabinet.",
            "This investigation sought to demonstrate the impact of adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as gauged by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed score), on the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, including stroke mortality. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes; monounsaturated fats in place of saturated fats; and fish, coupled with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPreviously conducted research has shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality (CVD). An intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in achieving weight loss and lowering the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis longitudinal study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Six times, between 1984 and 2004, an aMed score was calculated from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that measured nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses remained in the study for the entire 20-year period. FFQ data underwent validation. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical, hospital, autopsy, or death records. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate individual random variation and reflect long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs were computed. Adjustments were made for potential confounders, including age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazards modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, utilizing separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke occurrences.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was associated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk, 0.71).",
            "In the year 2007, the United States of America encountered a severe financial calamity. Unemployment surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous significant corporations were left in disarray. This economic downturn persists to this day, prompting us to investigate: what triggered this crisis, and how can we prevent its recurrence? Essentially, the financial crisis was sparked by a combination of self-serving and misguided political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into offering subprime loans within an inadequately developed financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves lacking sufficient capital reserves, which they then passed on to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately spreading the chaos to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999, as the President sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently paving the way for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted the consequences of these actions: “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced significant pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes accurately foreshadowed the potential fallout: “However, the government-subsidized corporation could face difficulties in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As highlighted in the introduction, and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending would inevitably lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the increasing complexity of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years preceding the crisis, further interlinking various economic sectors with the housing market. This overleveraging of households and financial markets in the housing sector made them highly susceptible to even minor fluctuations in price.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities in disarray. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion worth of mortgage debts, which constituted approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at distressed prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transition into commercial banks under intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the beginning stages of a narrative—where the wings are tested, and the audience either soars or drifts off into a slumber, often with a glare and a finger hovering over the back button. Dr. Merlin has been known to lash out at her screen during these moments, evidenced by the telltale echo of her frustrated screams. Exposition, it turns out, is not always a welcome visitor.\n\nWhile the maxim \"Show, don't tell\" may be well-known, Dr. Merlin often finds herself entangled in dense passages where action is scarce, or, even worse, overloaded with trivia. Exposition is the whisper in your ear, urging you to rush through the past to get to the points of interest. It's not the same as the voice urging you to share every minutiae of your characters' backgrounds.\n\nExposition, by definition, is the sharing of information, typically in a straightforward manner. In a film, this might be the character who monologues about their life's history, akin to a character from \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it's the author doing the talking.\n\nConsider this: you're reading a story where the heroine meets her beloved, they marry, and he is killed in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold in two pages, with each of them uttering only a couple of lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he feels for his wife. Similarly, the heroine should demonstrate through her actions how his presence enriched her life. This would allow you to feel his death as if it were your own, and thus, connect with the heroine more deeply.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide substance to the skeletal structure of your plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's tempting to gloss over some details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now works as a night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the place one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. But remember, these details should be revealed gradually, naturally weaving into the fabric of the story, not dumped all at once.",
            "I monitored two broadcasts originating from Columbus, Ohio yesterday. The first was a live report on NBC 4 (August 13, 2011). The main news item featured a disturbance involving a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who allegedly stabbed his spouse. The victim's identity was withheld, but the suspect's image was broadcast. The report was concise, devoted barely two minutes to the unfolding case, yet I found it proportionate to the story's development. The second story involved an early morning shooting in Sharon Woods, leaving an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers, critically injured. No arrests were made, and the SWAT team was continuing the investigation. This story was brief, a situation I've observed with minority victims of crimes, who often receive less media attention compared to white victims.\n\nThe next segment covered a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the incident, as well as the caliber of the bullet, a .22 from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasts for Saturday afternoon's rain and thunderstorms were brief, designed to entice viewers to stay tuned. Another report discussed a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, involving a dark-skinned black man dressed in a hooded sweatshirt. His description included height and weight. I found the emphasis on his race unusual. The final story involved Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced for marijuana distribution. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, he was described as receiving \"300\" months. His ethnicity was also mentioned, which seemed unnecessary to the story.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, an unyielding force that encompasses a myriad of feelings: affection, admiration, envy, and even malice, among others. This bond is unique, allowing brothers to comprehend one another on a level that transcends ordinary relationships. When challenges arise, this bond reveals itself in its entirety, whether it’s in its positive or negative aspects. These emotions, when revealed, carry substantial weight. Understanding the emotions born from this sibling link involves grappling with the repercussions they bring. When one looks into their brother’s eyes, they see not just their own reflection, but their true essence. The actions and their outcomes define their genuine character. In the story “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers navigate this theme, along with the intense emotions that accompany it. Their journey unfolds amidst a vivid, richly described landscape. A bittersweet clash of disillusionment and immense pride unfolds in the pivotal scene, with only one brother emerging alive. This theme is conveyed through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which conveys the intricate emotions experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions can be distilled into a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could learn all his skills, such as “holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a companion who could join him in “racing to Horsehead Landing…and perching with him in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Alas, these aspirations were dashed by Doodle’s extreme heart condition, making it unlikely he would survive, let alone engage in strenuous activities. The disappointment was immense for the young protagonist, whose mind was filled with grand dreams. Even so, he harbored some anger towards the young child, contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. Such thoughts are chilling, but they melted away when Doodle smiled at him. This moment of hope showed that the protagonist’s resolve was not steadfast. Deep down, there was a natural affection for his brother.",
            "The human cerebrum is an intricate, imaginative data translator. As tech evolved from rudimentary to contemporary, the analogies invoked to depict the brain have similarly evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, subsequently to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As your understanding of the brain deepens, keep in mind that the utility of these metaphors is restricted and can lead to fallacies.\n\nData processing commences with input from the sensory organs, transmuting tangible stimuli such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. The sensory data is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down modes. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box against a white backdrop, bottom-up processing integrates simple data like hue, direction, and border placement – where hue shifts abruptly – to conclude that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing leverages decisions made at certain stages of the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might assist in identifying the object as a black box, not a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce data is partially processed, an attention sieve determines its significance and which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention sieve prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process data, it must first be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Each type of sensory stimulus has specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be sustained. Certain animal studies propose that working memory, which holds information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal cycling through a specific neuronal circuit for a brief duration. Data in long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved in the structure of particular proteins.\n\nNumerous models describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, some rooted in human memory retrieval, others in computer science, and others in neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, Brave New World, the author critically examines the encroaching dangers of technological advancements and the capitalist framework that underpins them. The society depicted in the novel values collective harmony over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The people are pawns in a larger scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, serving as a manifestation of Huxley's concerns about the rise of these systems. Through a Marxist lens, it is apparent that Huxley's novel is a critique of the burgeoning economic landscape of his time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common populace is deluded about their true economic standing. They are primarily concerned with personal gain, a result of ideological control by the ruling class. This is evident in Brave New World's portrayal of the lower classes, Delta and Gamma, who are conditioned to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one social class by another, is explicit in this context, with the lower classes unwittingly supporting the status quo of capitalism and consumerism. Even the upper classes, the Alphas and Betas, though aware, largely accept their station, with characters like Bernard being exceptions. The interactions between social classes, as will be elaborated upon, are telling indicators of perceived capitalist oppression.\n\nIn Brave New World, personal relationships are almost nonexistent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, hinting that technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and expression. Emotions are kept superficial, with men only commenting on women's physical attributes, and women discussing their encounters openly. This superficiality reflects the societal class structure's complacency, mirroring Marxist theories about the proletariat's false sense of superiority as long as they continue to consume and comply. Their unquestioning obedience to their position in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic impact of capitalism.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, translating to roughly four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge for many, including myself. Freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dorm, situated quite far eastward on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Journeying from Stuart Hall to classes in locations such as Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in State College's capricious weather. Engaging with an alum, I discovered that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated by vast tracts of unused land. Today, this expanse has evolved into sports fields, new structures like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartments. As our campus expands, traversing between locations becomes increasingly arduous. So, what's the ideal solution to campus mobility? Bicycles seem to be the answer. However, bicycles alone won't remedy the issue. Students must ride them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nSpeaking with a friend who recently resumed cycling after a hiatus, he mentioned, “Bikes are fantastic; for a while, they weren't cool, but they're the only feasible way to get around.” Besides being physically beneficial, bicycling is an efficient mode of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many peers, I now live off campus, equidistant from the campus center as some dorms. My wisest decision this year was investing in a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, can be reduced to 5 minutes by cycling swiftly. The primary challenge lies in Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, which isn't always smooth sailing. Walking is viable, but my schedule is too hectic to accommodate it. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That equates to over two and a half hours weekly, not to mention other instances of walking to classes, appointments, and more. That's time better spent elsewhere."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my pursuit of a degree in social work, I aim to work within the Division of Family and Children Services, focusing on supporting children who have experienced abuse or neglect and aiding troubled families. The values I bring to this field are service, respect, ethical integrity, dedication to fostering healthy relationships, and a commitment to continuous professional growth. These are not just professional tenets; they are deeply personal convictions.\n\nIn my high school and college years, I observed many individuals retreat from their challenges in denial or adopt unhelpful coping strategies. Inspired by these observations, I chose to study psychology, though I remained uncertain about my career path. Post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break. During this time, a friend introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy who was escaping his abusive home. To assist, I visited his parents' residence with the police. The parents' dismissive attitudes and defensive excuses prompted me to consider social work as a potential career path to aid children dealing with family conflict.\n\nSocial justice is another critical value in this field. Society often claims individual importance yet often conforms to traditional norms. I advocate for individuality and have protested injustices throughout my academic journey. I believe in fighting against racism, discrimination, and other social inequalities. My actions, such as unconventional fashion choices and involvement with GSBA, reflect my commitment to social justice.",
            "The subsequent paper examines the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives on the issue of insomnia. The Biological model concentrates on genetic attributes and health-related aspects, while the Sociocultural model explores environmental factors and how they relate to demographics, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into both models, selecting specific research to elucidate each and critiquing the findings for their respective strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be classified into three main types: primary sleep disorders, those linked to other mental conditions, and those resulting from external factors. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Axis I or Axis II disorders, which are categorized under mental health conditions, can also cause sleep difficulties. Dyssomnias encompass conditions like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, while Parasomnias involve behavioral or physiological disturbances during sleep. This review primarily focuses on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with some consideration of their connection to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic makeup and physiological aspects. Orexin-containing neurons in the hypothalamus play a critical role in sleep-wake regulation. Research conducted on mice found that specific GABAB receptors on these neurons influence sleep and wakefulness. Activation of the GABAA receptor can promote sleep, whereas its inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and promote sleep. The use of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in the mice study. This suggests that similar mechanisms may operate in humans, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for this receptor's function. However, a deficiency or dysfunction in this receptor could impair one's ability to sleep properly without medication. The Sociocultural implications of this research suggest that heritable phenotypes could naturally regulate sleep, and any alteration in the receptor could disrupt sleep, thereby negatively affecting various aspects of life, such as education, work, and daily tasks requiring concentration.",
            "This essay will discuss three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). Initially, the disorder will be defined. Then, the process of diagnosis will be explained, highlighting typical indicators or \"red flags\". Lastly, the essay will explore strategies that a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can use to assist a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), can be defined as the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) processes auditory information. In essence, it refers to the perceptual processing of sound in the CNS and the neurobiological activity that underlies this processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. Simply put, it is a condition where the brain cannot correctly interpret sounds that are heard. Individuals with CAPD can hear normally but may struggle with interpreting or differentiating between sounds, especially in noisy environments or when multiple sounds occur simultaneously.\n\nThe earliest mention of the disorder that would later be known as CAPD comes from the mid-1950s, initially referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers, including an Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954, and later Kimura in 1961, began developing tests for children with communicative disorders. A national conference in 1977 further stimulated research into CAPD.\n\nThe manifestations of CAPD can vary significantly. Individuals may have difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between different sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting sarcasm based on changes in voice, or understanding the sequence of auditory information. More severely affected individuals may have difficulty synthesizing sound clues or interpreting sounds in a meaningful way.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD typically involves a systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on tests of auditory function. This can be conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals using various measures that evaluate auditory-related skills. These tests may include questionnaires, surveys, and observations of how the individual responds to specific auditory stimuli. There is currently no single, definitive test for diagnosis, and the exact cause of CAPD remains unknown. Many tests present the individual with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli to evaluate their ability to differentiate items like numbers or words. More advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "The stagecraft of Twelfth Night appears to suggest that while donning disguises can facilitate prolonged deceptions, ultimately, one must shed these masks to avoid losing one's true self. However, concluding a deception can lead to feelings of isolation. The challenge lies in choosing between safeguarding one's identity or maintaining relationships with others. While some may react indifferently to being deceived, others may feel affronted by the deception's artifice.\n\nThe theme of gender role reversal through deception raises complex questions, particularly concerning the motives behind adopting an opposite-gender guise. For Viola, her disguise is a means of self-preservation in an unfamiliar land. She initially succeeds in her ruse but finds herself estranged from her female peers, cutting off a crucial support network. Additionally, her convincing portrayal of a man leads Olivia to mistake her for Sebastian and develop romantic feelings. “Where shall I go, my lord? Cesario, stay with me as my husband.” (5.1.138) Moreover, Viola must navigate suppressed romantic interests, namely with Orsino: “Boy, you've told me a thousand times that you should not love a woman like me.” (5.1.260-261)\n\nThis perspective, though somewhat progressive, may seem problematic to modern audiences. Twelfth Night could be seen as demonstrating how deception can help release hidden emotions, notably in Olivia and Orsino's cases. It's possible that their feelings for Cesario/Viola bring to light unacknowledged desires they've suppressed. For instance, is Olivia drawn to Cesario because of his male appearance, or does she secretly harbor feelings for women? This scenario seems unlikely, as Shakespeare's character Olivia seems more likely to judge others based on their appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, regarding Cesario/Viola as a sister rather than a romantic interest: “You are my sister.” (5.1.315)",
            "The harsh nature of German colonial rule cannot be ignored, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. The complexity of colonial rule across German colonies is significant, exhibiting diverse policies and governance. Educational initiatives varied widely. Upon seizing German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, the British encountered a populace with substantial levels of education and literacy. Similarly, contemporary accounts praised educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies. In stark contrast, South West Africa (today's Namibia) presented a markedly different scenario. While East Africa saw government-run state schools and substantial native education, South West Africa relied heavily on missionary societies with limited government backing. The colonial government, however, invested considerably in European education, establishing state schools and supporting missionary schools rigorously. These educational policies had enduring impacts on South West Africa, even post-German rule. Unlike other German colonies, South West Africa saw the majority of its population remain uneducated and illiterate due to a variety of social, political, and economic factors. This thesis aims to delve into these factors, focusing on recent research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education in the German colonial empire. Most sources are in German, originating from the early 20th century, coinciding with or immediately following German rule. Early works often described educational systems in these colonies. Later English publications expanded on this, offering comparative studies and detailed analyses. These studies highlighted notable differences in educational systems across colonies. Cohen's work, which compares education in South West Africa and East Africa, is particularly relevant to this study. Cohen attributes many distinctions in South West Africa's educational system to its large settler population.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa had a relatively mild climate, though much of the territory was arid desert. This climate influenced the European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to approximately 5,336 in the next largest settler colony, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the last century, encompassing numerous genres that can be challenging to enumerate entirely. Further complicating this, most genres—such as rap, rock, country, jazz, folk—have birthed numerous sub and sub-sub genres within their domains. Notably, Heavy Metal rock, emerging in the past four decades, has become one of the most multifaceted and expressive genres in popular music. Its expressiveness stems from its broad emotional spectrum, albeit leaning towards darker emotions. It is also characterized by its diversity, with early adopters recognizing its flexibility and subsequently developing various sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nIn contemporary heavy metal, the multitude of niche sub-genres has made it difficult to pinpoint the exact essence of heavy metal. It has absorbed elements from various other genres, yet it has its roots in a specific origin. To comprehend the vast landscape of metal music today, one must first understand the metal movement and its distinction from a traditional genre.\n\nMetal can be seen as a movement defined by its darker themes. It is often referred to as a \"music of excess\"—more bass, louder volume, more aggression, and more theatricality. It is less primitive and more technically proficient, with band members exhibiting impressive musical skills. Additionally, metal is renowned for its association with drug experimentation. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s led to artists creating wild, otherworldly music, using drugs as an inspiration. This genre possesses dark, visceral qualities, which were not previously prominent in popular music. Later generations of metal have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements of the Romantic Era. Lyrics like those from Helter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, exemplify the darker themes prevalent in metal. This song is considered one of the earliest heavy metal tracks and was a response to a similarly darker song by the Rolling Stones. The Beatles aimed to prove they could match the Stones' heavier, darker style by including it in their album The White Album.",
            "Years prior to the Surrealists' dream-inspired paintings, artist Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both in reality and imagination. The Dream, painted in 1910, does not merely depict a woman enthralled by her dreamt landscape but also embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations. From the outset of his work, he envisioned recognition, acceptance, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, grappling with an internal conflict to attain this goal. This struggle is epitomized in The Dream, where Rousseau must choose between conforming to established styles for acceptance or forging his own unique artistic path.\n\nTo comprehend The Dream, one must first acquaint oneself with Rousseau's life. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, France, Rousseau was the son of a prosperous tinsmith and hardware merchant. Raised without formal artistic training, he worked as a gabelou, or municipal toll service employee, until his late forties. Widowed and grieving the loss of eight infant children and his first wife, Clémence, he turned to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike his peers who idealized rural life, Rousseau was a folk painter, driven by the hopes and dreams of his lower-class peers.\n\nRousseau's desire for art world acceptance is understandable given his background. Unlike his contemporaries, he had no formal training and began his career later in life, competing with renowned artists like Matisse. In Modern French Painters, Jan Gordon notes that Matisse, driven by a fear of clichés, and Rousseau, seeking conventional recognition, were both driven by different motivations. \"Matisse, driven by a fear of painting tritely, while Rousseau's desire was to paint conventionally to be admitted to the Artiste Français,\" Gordon states.",
            "Numerous philosophers have posited an intrinsic bond between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I contend that this connection stems from a profound source. As John Keats asserts in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— / That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our knowledge comes from education or experience. Yet, we often find ourselves appreciating ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction, as Keats suggests. Both ethics and aesthetics strive to explain, rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty are typically attempts to elucidate why something is beautiful or moral, not to establish rules for judgment or creation.\n\nTake, for instance, the criticism of art or morals. A discourse on the worth of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" might involve concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but fundamentally, these do not encapsulate why it's considered good art. When asked about a favorite piece of art or literature, we often hear phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" preceding more detailed explanations. I argue that both art and morals cannot be fully reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor puts it, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way...you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics shares this transcendent essence. As Wittgenstein notes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I posit that this ineffable \"something\" is the most potent attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that forges a connection between them.\n\nI believe morality and art are so closely intertwined because we experience them most profoundly at a noumenal level, to borrow a Kantian term. They impact us at an experiential depth that transcends explanation. This bond is particularly evident in the art of literature. As McKean contends, \"What most distinguishes literature from other arts is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inapplicable to other arts, such as music, but they seem as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values... Literature is significant to us precisely because of the values we encounter there.\"",
            "The modern-day Germany is regarded as a formidable nation, a unified entity possessing a vibrant cultural tapestry that stretches from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This culture is palpable in Cologne along the River Rhine, through the heart of the country, and into the Saxon city of Dresden, situated on the Elbe. Such a rich cultural landscape is a testament to Germany's diverse origins, stemming from various tribes.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans, known as Germania, has a name whose origins are hotly debated among scholars and historians. Some attribute it to a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were previously known as Germans before crossing the Rhine and engaging in warfare against the Gauls, as documented by Tacitus in 98 AD. Others propose the name comes from a spear used in battle, called a \"ger,\" or possibly from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' prowess in warfare. Julius Caesar, in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars, employs the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between conquered Gauls and unconquered Germanic tribes.\n\nTacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et Situe Germani,\" describes the Germans as indigenous and unadulterated, having migrated via sea rather than land. He queries why one would choose to move from Asia or Africa to Germany, given its harsh climate and people's sullen demeanor. The Romans, facing these hardy Germanic tribes on their empire's periphery, primarily engaged in trade and occasional skirmishes, with Germanic warriors often serving in the Roman army. As the first century drew to a close, these tribes began appearing in large numbers, living on the empire's borders and exchanging goods and skills.",
            "A gaze downwards, mind hollow and attentive, took in the scene before me. Coldly, silently, with a trained detachment, I observed the subject of study, an object that my mind processed but refused to connect to any abstract comprehension. Ideas flitted in and out of my consciousness, so swiftly and seamlessly that it seemed I had no genuine thoughts of my own, merely a fluid and dynamic experience of what lay before my eyes.\n\nOnce, driven by an artist’s recommendation, I bought a drawing manual titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" My fascination with drawing began at the age of six, and this book teaches everything from understanding the basics of a pencil to how the brain interprets lines. A method the book advocates is to frame any image with a square, thus simplifying overwhelming detail and isolating the focus.\n\nIn that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't impose such a frame. I was too engrossed, too captivated to do more than gaze in awe. Masters like Picasso, Monet, and the Italian Renaissance painters had their unique styles, and here was the beginning of my own work, a potential masterpiece in brown.\n\nFingertips touched my chosen tool, muscles tensed and released as my hand moved through space, my mind giving form to creativity.

            "Adolescents are perishing at the wheel. A confluence of factors engenders this grim reality for our youngest American drivers. The National Institutes of Health highlight that one aspect of the problem lies in the immaturity of the teenage brain, which is not yet adept at coping with the perils of driving. Add to this the compounding factor of inexperience, which not only elevates the incidence of fatal crashes but also aggravates the risk of vehicle rollovers, speeding, and driving off the road. Teens, in particular, are more vulnerable when accompanied by their peers, a behavior that, as is well-known, is commonplace among them. A study by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. California and other states have implemented measures such as temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit other minors as passengers. However, these provisional licenses are, in my view, merely a temporary solution. The underlying issue is that, collectively, young drivers are statistically unfit to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman posits that even 18 years old may be too youthful for a standard driver’s license. USA Today reports Zuckerman’s research indicating a pronounced inclination among those under the age of 19-20 to engage in thrill-seeking behaviors. Therefore, it seems logical to postpone driving until this inclination subsides. If we persist in granting driver’s licenses to adolescents, we can anticipate an escalating number of deadly accidents. By 2010, the baby boomers' children will reach driving age, and millions of new adolescent drivers will be ready to hit the road. Legislation addressing this issue could be fairly straightforward. Schools could continue to offer driver’s education classes, but no one under the age of 18 should be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full driver’s license, with a predetermined number of practical driver training hours required, based on the majority of states’ current standards. Since these grim statistics span all states, a uniform, national legislation would be a sensible and potentially effective means of safeguarding teens across the nation. The legislation I propose is not an untested concept.",
            "Diving into the treasures of the Library of Congress's early Edison film archive, I stumbled upon fifteen trick films crafted between 1895 and 1901. These films exploit clever editing to create optical illusions. My analysis primarily delved into the poetic elements that underpin most trick films, while also scrutinizing the peculiarities in a handful of later films. The trick films of that era are typically confined within a static proscenium, using long and medium shots, and adhering to a one-shot-per-film philosophy. However, a few daring innovators began to experiment with multiple shots early in the 20th century.\n\nA distinctive feature of these trick films is their filming within a static stage setting, visualized through a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed, not moving to track figures or objects. This static approach was common in early cinema, drawing inspiration from theatre and vaudeville. Trick films, in particular, often mirror vaudeville magic acts, where performers move side-to-side, but never approach or leave the camera. Consider \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). Actors enter from the right and move horizontally across the stage, with the camera never following their action.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style often results in long and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent from these films, reflecting the theatre tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance. Actors typically remain in the mid-ground, avoiding close-ups. This one-shot-per-film standard limited most trick films to a minute or less in length, and their content to short vaudeville-style tricks like magic or disappearing acts. However, it's essential to note that the one-shot concept is deceptive; a single \"shot\" can comprise multiple joined segments to create illusions like apparitions or disappearances. For example, in \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), a close look reveals the transition where Mary's head appears to be severed, despite the film feeling like one continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, a resident of Caroline, was an early and enthusiastic advocate of Republicanism. Despite his primary occupation as an agriculturalist and brief tenure in politics, his commitment to personal liberty and governance was evident. His dedication to an agrarian lifestyle significantly influenced his views on governance, with his opinions on sovereignty, Constitutionality, and the judicial system being heavily rooted in this belief. Taylor sought to preserve and promote what he considered the superior career, thereby coloring his arguments on these matters. He posited that the United States had the unique opportunity to establish an ideal governance system due to the absence of native traditions that could hinder such a creation, allowing for a system of self-government. Taylor strongly believed in the interconnectedness of natural rights, asserting that if any right is denied, others are weakened in value. He argued that these rights should be immune to government intervention. He contended that the \"state of nature\" denoted the dominance of individuals with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence, but that in a civilized society, this should not be the case. To create an ideal society, Taylor proposed a government that recognized both the good and evil inherent in humanity. He was steadfast in his dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that protect property, enhance agriculture, and discourage capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, likely led by avarice and self-interest. Self-interest, he believed, is a natural human trait, but it becomes evil when it leads to sub-societies that exploit others. A good government is necessary to control this inherent evil, and even then, it must be closely monitored to prevent the introduction of bad principles. Taylor, like many of his Republican contemporaries, advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, favoring a minimal Federal government with only the powers explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could become oppressive due to its expense, but believed a literal interpretation without consideration of the writers' intent could lead to corruption. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly defines the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a single nation.",
            "Upon revisiting the data from Figure 17, a significant plunge in commuter log submissions was noted during the third month. This was somewhat discouraging, and the root cause remains unclear. The onset of winter in a New England setting likely contributed to a drop in those commuting via bicycle or on foot. Additionally, December marks the conclusion of the fall semester, a time when everyone is preoccupied with wrapping up coursework and grading. The commuter log submission process may have been inadvertently overlooked due to these distractions. Furthermore, December's busy holiday season culminates in a one-month break, with many not needing to visit campus during this period. The restart of classes in late January may also account for the low log submissions. However, the February dip remains unexplained. It is conceivable that any such project experiences an initial surge of enthusiasm, followed by a natural decline. To boost engagement, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which indeed led to an uptick in log submissions. Thus, maintaining project traction amidst declining engagement and semester breaks was a major hurdle. Another obstacle was the deeply ingrained preference for driving, which is a significant part of our culture. To incentivize alternative commuting modes, we offered a variety of rewards, including gift certificates to local businesses. It would have been intriguing to assess the impact of larger prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid, or electric car. If the prize values had increased over time, engagement may have improved.",
            "An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a financial instrument that tracks an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, akin to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility as it trades on an exchange like a stock. This type of fund provides the diversification of an index fund along with the advantages of individual stock ownership, such as the ability to short sell, use margin, and purchase as few as one share. Despite these alluring benefits, ETFs typically have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. However, a key drawback is the necessity to pay a commission for each trade, similar to stock transactions. Furthermore, the extensive range of available funds offers a variety of options. Nonetheless, it is essential for astute investors to assess whether the touted benefits, such as diversification, genuinely exist and to what extent. In this analysis, we will scrutinize the ETF IHF and compare it with its top 10 holdings to determine if holding a single ETF can approximate the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks, as well as to ascertain if there are more optimal configurations of these stocks to enhance the Sharpe ratio or return.\n\nConsidering the impracticality of including every holding, we have elected to focus on the top ten holdings, which constitute 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is a list of these top holdings and their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF, we will normalize the current percentages of assets to 100% and calculate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio comprises only these ten stocks in the proportion held by the ETF. The Beta and Return calculations are shown in the table beneath.\n\nFrom the table, it is clear that a portfolio composed solely of the top ten holdings yields a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Additionally, the Beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF as a whole. Based on these findings, a portfolio of just the top ten holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, the statistical significance of this difference remains to be determined.\n\nTo evaluate the statistical significance, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% for a comparative assessment of their combined standard deviation in relation to the ETF IHF.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's more notable compositions, \"Dream-Land,\" is often considered one of his finest works. Within this poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference traceable to Virgil, who utilized it in relation to an island north of Britain, deemed the edge of the known world by the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, another source merits consideration. Poe's interest in German authors is well-documented, making the connection to Goethe plausible.\nThis connection bears significance as it reveals Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writings. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" highlights the similarity between the two poets' works, suggesting Poe was inspired by Goethe. The Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe is renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the second part of Faust, a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" appears, detailing a king whose wife's death following a gift of a goblet leads to his own demise, marked by heavy drinking and despair. The parallels between \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with the latter's speaker sharing a similar state of melancholy and despair.\nPoe's references to Thule are not isolated. He uses the term \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" and employs \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land\" as bookends to the poem. This suggests a deliberate echoing of \"The King of Thule.\" The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a dark, lonely landscape, haunted by the specters of dead friends, and a world lacking color—scenes that resonate with the despair of Goethe's king. The poems can be seen as companion pieces, with \"Dream-Land\" functioning as a direct interpretation of Goethe's poem. Poe's admiration for Tennyson further strengthens the connection, as he would have been exposed to Goethe's work through Tennyson's influence and the numerous reproductions of Goethe's works in his time.",
            "In accordance with California law, would it be feasible for a patron who suffered an injury after slipping on an applesauce spill in a supermarket to secure punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager's inaction was motivated by malice? A judge may hesitate to summarily reject Jennifer Palmer's punitive damage claim. To establish a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant's actions were intentional and included a disregard for the probable harm, as well as evidence of conduct that is considered despicable. Palmer could argue that Martin should have been aware of the potential harm of leaving the spill uncleaned, given the multiple incidents at D&D involving customers slipping in the months prior to her accident. While her argument regarding despicable conduct might be less convincing, it remains reasonable considering the six slip-and-fall incidents reported in 2009 with no appropriate actions taken for safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, an employee of D&D Markets, Rich Wayne, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on dinner break and \"didn't have time to address customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Mr. Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. At 5:30 PM on the same day, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of obligation not stemming from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct aiming to cause harm, or, lacking intent, with a \"willful and conscious disregard for the safety of others.\" Id. at § (c)(1). Courts have deemed conduct malicious when committed with a disregard for a plaintiff's rights if the defendant \"was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.\" Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Four years ago, I engaged in a course on Islam at CBC. The class frequently debated whether Islam is inherently hostile, a discourse that seems more pertinent today than ever. Since the events of 9/11, I've noticed a shift in media perception, moving from a hostile stance towards extremism to a hyper-tolerant view of Islam. In 2001, it's doubtful a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his evident Muslim background, could have been conceived.\n\nThe Prophet's Biography captivates me, yet it diverges from my understanding of Muhammad. Historical accounts depict him as a conqueror, forcing tribes to adopt Islam. In contrast, the biography portrays him as a misunderstood martyr, humbly awaiting converts. This discrepancy suggests a narrative intent to elevate Muhammad without necessitating miracles or proof.\n\nMoreover, parallels drawn between Jesus and Muhammad's ministries, such as the multiplication of food, create an impression of Muhammad as a humble prophet. This approach appears to diminish Jesus' life and miracles, potentially appropriating His legacy for Muhammad.\n\nSeveral tales in the biography present a third-party perspective, replicating a chain of hearsay: \"So-and-so heard from so-and-so...\" While intended to validate stories, this method diminishes their credibility.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the glorification of Muhammad as a gentle, wise, and humble figure, despite historical evidence contradicting this image. If Muslims today were aware of Muhammad's true ascension to power, it might challenge their perception of him.",
            "The message and convictions espoused by Jesus during his tenure on Earth seemed to be swiftly eclipsed, as the evolving landscape of Christian thought diverged progressively from its roots. A cursory examination of this trajectory reveals a trend where Christianity has steadily distanced itself from its inception. In our contemporary world, there is an evident growth in awareness and a burgeoning progressive mindset. However, it's important to acknowledge that those who cling to traditional teachings may not be a predominant force. In the future, there will likely be a surge in historical consciousness among Christians, a desire to delineate between the doctrines appended over time and the genuine intent of Christianity's namesake. This process may take generations, but the ultimate outcome is unavoidable: a significant shift back to Christianity's original form. A movement will emerge, systematically stripping away superfluous doctrines, akin to rewinding time, until what remains is an unadulterated version of Jesus' teachings, untainted by subsequent thought leaders. As this change sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing the masses to practice as they did in Jesus' time, the church will persist as a guiding force. Yet, due to this theological regression, the previously rampant diversity in Christian thought and practice will give way to increasing uniformity. Regional, denominational, and factional differences will yield to similarities. Throughout history, such reversals have occurred. Once shunned and persecuted, Christians were later adopted by the Roman Empire. Similarly, our nation has transitioned from oppressing to uplifting African Americans. The impending reversal in Christian history will mirror these changes, seeking the original source and reducing diversity in the process. A key factor in this will be a shift in interpreting Jesus' words as symbolic rather than literal. So, what transpired following Jesus' lifetime?\nIf we peer deeply into the past, we find Judaism, the foundational theology of Christianity. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the supremacy of Hebrew scriptures were core to this religion when the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. This Jewish population was not united but divided into various factions, including Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common folk.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" presents a chilling portrait of human nature, revealing the innate greed and selfishness that drives individuals to prioritize personal gain over the well-being of others. The narrative exemplifies this through the actions of the factory owners and managers, who seek to expand their empires with unyielding determination, disregarding the collateral damage caused by their relentless pursuit. Sinclair vividly illustrates the environmental fallout, with \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" highlighting the callous indifference towards pollution and its consequences. The owners' disregard for their employees is equally evident, with \"So from the top to the bottom, the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar,\" showcasing the exploitative nature of their operations. The lack of worker protections during this period enabled this cruel exploitation, forcing employees to toil in deplorable conditions and face sudden dismissals without compensation or support. The workers, trapped in this oppressive system, were as much victims of servitude as those in chattel slavery, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Various writers implement distinctive methods to evoke specific emotions or sentiments in their readers concerning pivotal themes. F. Scott Fitzgerald employs numerous such techniques in his literary work, \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he combines adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to create an atmosphere around a subject. At other times, he assigns significance to symbols, utilizing them for similar purposes. This latter technique is frequently employed by Fitzgerald, particularly with colors such as gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. In his novel, Fitzgerald elaborates on the symbolic meaning of these colors and later employs this meaning to remind readers of certain feelings regarding important elements.\n\nFitzgerald's association of white/gray with uniformity involves assigning white a higher, more refined connotation, and gray a more dated, faded one. This is established early in the novel through repeated mentions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white,\" as are Nick's attire at Gatsby's party, Tom's shirt during his meeting with Myrtle, and Catherine's powdered milky complexion. White/gray uniformity is further emphasized by the color of less significant subjects and characters: Nick encounters \"the white chasms of lower New York\" on his way to work, and at Gatsby’s parties, names are \"gray\" on Nick's schedule. Additionally, Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses,\" and plain or ordinary people are described as white or gray, such as the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child, and the \"gray old man\" dog-seller.\n\nHaving instilled the meaning of white/gray in these ways, Fitzgerald uses them to signify unimportance or uniformity in characters and objects. This strategy begins with Daisy, who is described in white after a period of significant absence from the narrative, making her appear less like a developed character and more like a uniform addition desired by Gatsby. This technique is reinforced with repeated use of white and gray around Daisy, such as her fur collar described as \"a gray haze\" and her attire in a white dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "The county of San Diego boasts a thriving agricultural landscape, bolstered by its temperate, sun-drenched environment. The region's crops are diverse, encompassing tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic, locally sourced produce is robust, with numerous community-supported agriculture programs featuring extensive waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk also enjoy high popularity. Many organic farms offer immersive tours and recreational experiences, such as hiking and birdwatching, while integrating government programs to maximize both financial benefits and ecological preservation.\n\nOrganic farming, despite being more labor-intensive and costly than conventional methods, offers the advantage of increased biodiversity and a healthier environment due to the absence of chemicals. However, it faces challenges such as higher labor and management costs, potential yield losses, and a lack of operational scale efficiency. Beyond organic farming practices, additional wildlife-friendly measures may further escalate labor costs, including planting cover crops, managing grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth for specific ecological conditions.\n\nThe selected property is a 160-acre parcel located near the town of Potrero, within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This area is home to various plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or at risk, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. The land, previously inhabited by Native Americans and later used for cattle ranching and wood production, is currently under review for its conservation potential.\n\nI selected this property from an online real estate listing and explored various government programs to assist small farmers in cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices. As a hypothetical model, I identified an organic farm in the same area to illustrate what a landowner might strive to achieve.",
            "The role of culture in negotiations is multifaceted and profound. Culture, in essence, can be understood as much by what it excludes as what it includes, and the meaning it conveys. It is neither uniform nor monolithic. Stereotypes such as \"all Germans are punctual\" or \"all French are romantic\" oversimplify and generalize cultural nuances. While understanding these generalizations is useful, a negotiator should focus on the specific cultural context and its impact on discussions. Encountering a foreign culture often leads to comparisons with one's own, but true comprehension involves studying history, recognizing biases, and embracing rather than altering it. In negotiations, particularly when one holds a less advantageous position, understanding and respecting the local culture can break down barriers and advance the dialogue.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that corporate culture, too, can vary widely, regardless of national boundaries. Within a single country, companies may promote different work environments, from long hours to flexible schedules. Observing employee attire, communication styles, and hiring practices can reveal a company's cultural identity. For example, some businesses promote employee philanthropy broadly, while others restrict it to approved causes. Even within the United States, corporate cultures can vary greatly, from coast to coast and across urban and suburban regions. Some cultures appear more homogeneous, but a deeper dive is necessary to uncover their true complexity.\n\nUnderstanding values is equally, if not more, important. Values provide the motivation behind a culture's actions. If preserving face or maintaining harmony is valued, a negotiator would avoid public confrontation to achieve success. Conversely, a culture valuing aggressive bargaining might not settle quickly. Recognizing these values before negotiations begins is essential, but personal insights into the opponent's background can also enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The quote, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’\" appears initially in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is the opening of St. Anselm’s argument for the existence of God. Aquinas, another notable figure, shares a similar stance, and our task is to appraise the strength of their arguments. To simplify our comparison, we'll assume both belief in the Bible's God is valid. An alternative divine figure might hinder our assessment, as their arguments focus on this specific concept. Both authors shed light on noteworthy points, though neither argument fully substantiates God's existence.\n\nSt. Anselm's argument hinges on introspection. He posits that God's existence is evident within our understanding, necessitating no external evidence. This idea, though somewhat convoluted, posits that God's proof lies within our minds. This is akin to the Christian principle of faith, accepting truths without definitive empirical proof.\n\nContrasting Aquinas, he insists God's existence can be proven through reason and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This would aid evangelism by persuading through logic alone. Aquinas presents five arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, each underscoring the logical necessity of God. If given a puzzle with one missing piece, logical deduction dictates knowing its features without seeing it directly.",
            "Around the midpoint of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a royal figure destined to be revered as Buddha came into being. Throughout his life, he chose to forsake worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, giving birth to Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being Theravada. This ancient faith is nearing its twenty-fifth century, and its appearance today is vastly different from its origins. For example, in the Theravada-majority nation of Sri Lanka, the annual water-cutting ritual is observed. Participants, be they monks or laypeople, engage in this ritual, underscoring its religious significance, despite Buddha never having advocated any such celebration. These discrepancies span from outward traditions to the religion’s core tenets. The Theravada Buddhist community, whether from the monastic or secular vantage, has had to adapt its doctrinal principles over time, influenced by both external and internal factors, both hostile and amicable.\nIn this discourse, certain pivotal terms will be frequently employed. Internal forces are defined as those stemming from the Buddha's teachings, regardless of one's role within the community. External forces encompass influences from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that harm or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often driven by a negative perception of the faith. Benign forces, conversely, do not aim to cause harm or aid the community, though their outcomes may vary.\nTo commence, let us examine Buddhism's foundational principles. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, essentially, comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of sacred texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka encompasses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these concepts is crucial for escaping Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, along with its associated passions—lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion)—upon achieving enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes life rules, with laypeople adhering to five precepts (not killing, not lying, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct, and not ingesting intoxicants), and monks observing many more rules. The most fundamental Buddhist doctrine is the four noble truths. Life is marked by suffering (Dukkha), attachment causes this suffering, and it can be overcome.",
            "The United States and Mexico once had a long-standing rivalry that lasted from 1836 to 1893, a period marked by significant tension and conflict. The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848, where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring Texas and the American Southwest. This was part of a broader series of disputes between the two nations, many of which were rooted in cultural, religious, and economic differences, as well as territorial claims and border issues (Diehl & Goerts, 2000, p. 145). Comparably, other neighboring nations have also experienced enduring rivalries due to shared borders and differing interests. David M. Pletcher (1977) noted that only Mexico and Cuba had persistent, overarching American diplomatic issues, largely due to their geographical proximity and historical rivalries (p. 41). religious differences were a significant factor, with Americans often opposing Catholicism and monarchy, mirroring the ideological struggles of the Cold War but focused on religious preferences rather than political structure (Frahm, 2001, p. 86). These historical and cultural animosities, inherited from their former colonial rulers, posed substantial challenges to forming amicable relations. Diehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes during this rivalry, most of which were territorial in nature, involving border raids and frontier issues that persisted until both countries deployed military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). Schmitt (1974) explained that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States, marking a shift from territorial expansion to economic intervention as a primary concern for the United States in the late 19th century (p. 109-110).",
            "Fifteen years past, I was unexpectedly disabled by an affliction I had not previously known existed. I was a nurse, having chosen this profession due to an ingrained need for security and stability that my childhood lacked. \"You'll always find work; people will always get sick\" was the refrain I heard as I grew into adolescence and beyond. Thus, despite my dreams of becoming a scientist or journalist, I found myself in nursing. Yet here I was: 46 years old, unmarried, penniless, and unable to work. Disability has been my companion for 15 years, and after living on Social Security Disability, I find myself with nothing truly mine. Life has been a constant struggle, an assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty permeates every aspect of my life, but one truth remains certain: I could not have persevered without my family's assistance and the kindness of a few friends. When disaster strikes, you realize just how vulnerable you truly are.\n\nMy message is that life is fraught with emergencies, big and small. There's no absolute security, and no amount of preparation can mitigate everything. While I agree that we should not rely solely on government, I believe we should foster trust and mutual support among Americans. The Conservatives often tout the \"rugged individualism\" that supposedly built this nation, but it was actually compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources that sustained our forefathers during hard times. Pioneers crossing the Rockies did not achieve their goal alone.\n\nSo, I strongly advise: be prepared. I have disaster supplies, including a first aid kit, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for windows. I have flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the means, consider farming and preserving food. However, while preparing, don't forget to build connections with your neighbors.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve as they do remains intriguing. Are there inherent constraints steering the path of evolutionary change? While D'Arcy Thompson in 1917 opined that even the simplest organic forms are yet to be defined mathematically, the same sentiment holds true today. Recent advancements have seen mathematical modeling applied to mollusk skeletogenesis through both developmental and evolutionary contexts. Our research investigates how mathematical modeling of Prunum, augmented by experimental studies, can illuminate the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes. Utilizing X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies in CerioShell software. These models help interpret the limits of possible morphological transformations in Prunum, complementing experimental and descriptive studies to better understand macroevolutionary events.\n\nA shell, fundamentally, is a spiraling tube traversing 360 degrees of space. These revolutions, or coils, are termed whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, demarcated by a continuous line called a suture. Typically, the largest coil, termed the body whorl, is the last. The spire comprises all whorls except the last, with the apex being the spire's tip and the base its opposite end. The aperture is the opening through which the animal extends from its shell.\n\nShells can be examined from apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The \"standard\" orientation is an apertural view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, first view the shell from the apical position and determine where the first suture begins. Draw a line dividing the shell, then count whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl as necessary.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell. The aperture’s trajectory can be tracked via coordinates of each whorl's center and the aperture’s horizontal and vertical radii. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be varied to alter mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesian neonatal and infant mortality rates have shown little to no improvement over the past decade, despite the nation's progress in meeting various Millennium Development Goals such as clean water and sanitation. However, the enhancements needed for child and maternal health to meet the 2015 targets remain elusive. The underlying causes for this plight—including the prominence of traditional birth attendants and inadequate postnatal care—suggest a need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than singular programmatic initiatives.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed an increase in births attended by skilled personnel, reaching 72%. Nevertheless, this figure encompasses traditional birth attendants like midwives who lack the capacity to handle complicated pregnancies, resulting in a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Furthermore, there's a decline in the percentage of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea, and the postnatal care data reveals widespread concern.\n\nCesarean-section rates, currently at around 4%, fall short of expectations, with a stark contrast between urban (7%) and rural (2%) settings, indicating discrepancies in healthcare access. This disparity in service utilization is also evident between the poorest and richest quintiles, with a 27% gap, suggesting that the impoverished face significant barriers to healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering strategies to enhance neonatal and maternal healthcare, the critical question is how to best address the dearth of services. Should Indonesia adopt targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen the entire healthcare system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care? Vertical programs, which concentrate on improving one sector, offer targeted and manageable goals with quicker results. However, these targeted approaches can lead to resource depletion in other sectors, cause duplication of services, and increase administrative burdens due to uncoordinated programs.",
            "Victorian literature is distinguished by its meticulous attention to detail, with a particular focus on the aristocracy of the era. However, there are exceptions to this norm, such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. These works incorporate elements of mystery and the peculiar, which are uncommon in typical Victorian literature, thereby enhancing the characters and providing deeper insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\n“A swarm of bewildering and perplexing ideas invaded his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were fervently arguing: for the very words they uttered echoed in his ears, and when he attempted to focus, he discovered he was conversing with them. Suddenly, he recoiled at the sound of gunfire; and amidst a flurry of shrieks and shouts, blinding lights, and chaotic noise, an unseen entity swiftly carried him away. Through this whirlwind of visions, there lingered an indistinct, unsettling awareness of pain, which gnawed and tormented him unceasingly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels employ mystery primarily through dream sequences or dreamlike states, with the content and purpose varying in each case. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences often unveil aspects of Oliver's inner self, his anguish, and his understanding of the true nature of his surroundings. Upon revisiting the shooting of Oliver in chapter 28, he relives the experience vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the dire state of his health, which was evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelmed him, numbing all his senses and leaving him unaware of the \"unseen hand\" that bore him away; he experienced his despair anew, removed from the shock of pain, with the pain now constant and linked with fear rather than surprise. Given Oliver's overwhelmed state, the question arises whose will brought about his misfortune, as it could hardly have been his own. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his circumstances, even when his life is at stake. A sense of desolation in Oliver is also implied, as if the influence of old Fagin has begun to break him, compelling him to accept this despair and impacting his ability to respond. Otherwise, it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least for the sake of his own life.\n\n“The day faded, or at least it seemed to. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as it arrived – and night descended, a night that seemed endless, yet fleeting; long in its dreadful silence and short in its hasty flight.”",
            "Several years ago, I was an assistant in an after-school program, assisting elementary-aged students with their academic needs. My forte was in English and reading, but I was asked by a colleague to aid a young boy named Adrian, who was having difficulty with reading. His circumstances were puzzling; he could pronounce certain letters accurately, while others were completely off. Despite his Latino heritage, he spoke flawless English, which seemed contradictory. After some time, I met Adrian's mother, who communicated solely in Spanish, despite my rudimentary Spanish skills. It became evident that Adrian could read but struggled with the English alphabet and its pronunciation. This revelation, while not solving his problems, was a key insight into the language barrier many students face.\n\nThis anecdote highlights the complexity of language barriers in educational settings, particularly in California. It underscores how seemingly fluent English speakers can encounter significant hurdles in reading. The challenge is evident, but the solutions are multifaceted. For some, like Adrian, additional tutoring in English reading, especially focusing on the alphabet and pronunciations, may suffice. For others, particularly those with limited English proficiency, the solutions are more intricate.\n\nThe dual language system, which involves educating students in both their native language and English, is a promising approach. It has been proven to improve academic performance for bilingual students. However, implementing this system universally is not without its challenges. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical, employing bilingual aides or tutors can offset this. The key lies in integrating various strategies, such as dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes, to create a comprehensive solution.",
            "From a tender age, humans are often introduced to the notion of something larger than ourselves, a concept that we cannot fully grasp or understand. Some are indoctrinated into religious institutions, while others seek guidance from within or explore various spiritual paths. Many embrace the faith instilled in them by their forebears, while others vehemently reject it, asserting that the world ends at their own personal experiences. Our journeys to define our selves are colored by our unique interpretations of spirituality, a search for illumination in the darkness to guide us towards enlightenment.\n\n“Redbirds,” my dad said casually when I inquired about his preferred aviary. We sat on the front porch, the rain's steady rhythm drumming against the metallic roof above, as we shared smokes. The downspouts channeled the water, drenching the flora around us. His gaze was distant, as if lost in contemplation and memory. He appeared gaunt, his clothes loose and his hair thinner than I recalled. His eyes avoided mine. I felt isolated, anxious, and unable to discuss with him the impending loss that would intensify our reality. I embraced him, resuming my seat closer to his, and joined him in contemplating the rain’s descent in the June twilight.\n\nMy father bid his last farewell in December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The medical interventions had prolonged his suffering but prolonged his life a few additional months beyond what the physicians had anticipated; the value, however, remained elusive. What deity would inflict such pain? I questioned in solitude. In the darkness, I offered no supplications. If such a being existed, I believed it had ceased listening to me long before.\n\nI did not wish to witness his passage from this life to another. Thus, I did not bear witness. I did not desire to observe the life that had given me life as it faded. I preferred to remember my father as he lived, not as he died. Moreover, I understood my father better than his relatives and believed he would not wish for his sole offspring to be a mere spectator at his departure. I curled into a fetal position in my bed for three days, waiting for the inevitable.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The classic \"Gothic Novel,\" labeled an \"Old-New oxymoron\" by Ian Watt in The Rise of the Gothic Novel, has faced varied criticism and commendation. Praised for its 'terrible sublime' and derided for its lack of depth, the Gothic mode has been a staple of literary discourse since its inception. Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, a seminal work in the genre, blended ancient and modern romance elements to birth the proto-Gothic. Integrating old theatrical elements and new mimicry of nature, Walpole presented a novel with a unique narrative structure, allowing readers an intimate glimpse into characters' psyches. The Gothic genre, steeped in medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions, fascinated readers despite its archaic reputation. The fusion of these elements with the novel form allowed Gothic literature to persist over time, acting as both a relic of the past and a fresh exploration for later audiences.\n\nOne significant theme prevalent in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval ideals of chivalry, depicted in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, remain central to the genre. Chivalry appealed to Gothic writers, who sought to romanticize a bygone era they viewed as superior to their contemporary society. Walpole's personal political turmoil may have influenced his portrayal of society's moral decline, as evident in characters like Frederic. Although Frederic embodies classic chivalric traits, his depiction hints at Walpole's despair over societal moral decay. Frederic's description illustrates these themes, with Walpole emphasizing the prince's chivalric qualities, such as his status, tragic past, and imminent demise at the hands of infidels.",
            "Supply chain orchestration, a process that involves the movement of goods from the moment of customer order to the point where raw materials are transformed into end products and distributed to the customer, is a critical function in business operations. The concept was coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described it as a comprehensive approach to planning, executing, and supervising the supply chain to meet customer demands swiftly and effectively. This system is composed of six fundamental elements: production, procurement, inventory, location, logistics, and information. These elements are utilized by business managers to deliver superior customer service.\n\nThe initial phase in the supply chain process is production. This is the cornerstone of the entire system. Production determines the timing, purpose, location, and methodology of creating goods. Managers must comprehend customer preferences to make informed decisions. By examining market trends, managers can discern customer demands. With a clear understanding of customer needs, managers can decide which products to produce and in what quantities. Post-decision, managers must select suitable production sites that balance volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. The subsequent focus is on workload scheduling and equipment upkeep. Production is a pivotal step; meticulous planning is essential to avoid delays and financial losses. For instance, I've worked in retail environments like Wal-Mart and Target, where each operation follows a structured plan, from uniform design to receiving shipments. These plans ensure smooth operations and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key factor in supply chain management is procurement. Procurement involves strategic decisions that define a facility's core capabilities and partnerships. A single product may require multiple production units, each with unique equipment, personnel, and specialties. Managers must select the most suitable division for various product processes. Outsourcing may also be an option to enhance velocity, which is the capacity to deliver high-quality, flexible products at reduced costs or sustained low prices.",
            "A peculiar sign reads: \"Adolf Hitler lives in Myanmar.\" Ellen Page, renowned for her role in ‘Juno’, stands solitary on a city corner, holding a makeshift placard with the chilling message scrawled in marker. Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation governed by a dictatorial military council since 1962, has a history of suppressing dissent. In 2007, monks sparked street protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution,\" that grew as masses joined in. Initially tolerating these peaceful gatherings, the regime escalated to violent crackdowns, invading monasteries and imprisoning foreign journalists, with a photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, fatally shot on September 27th, 2007. Officials claim 13 deaths, but defector Colonel Hla Win estimates thousands more.\n\nThis isn't novel; history is replete with rulers seeking total control. Ancient Roman emperors, Japanese emperors, and even current US presidents have had similar aspirations. Notable instances include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where the government's fatality estimates range from 200 to 3,000, and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s, where Hutu militia and the Rwandan government killed Tutsis and political moderates. Hitler's Third Reich, a period spanning several years and countries, saw the systematic murder of Jews.",
            "The enduring influence of Duke Ellington on the landscape of jazz is marked by his enduring tenacity and profound creativity in guiding his orchestra. Ellington's piano presence in many of the pieces chosen for this examination is often understated, yet his prowess as a composer shines through as he fashions intricate compositions that highlight the unique talents of his band members. Ellington's genius lies in his ability to craft a framework that permits soloists to improvise freely, while also penning tightly structured arrangements and phrases that amplify the distinct styles of his players, creating harmonious and original sounds that complement each piece. The Grove Music dictionary attests to Ellington's sound and innovation, noting his pioneering use of voice as an instrument in \"Creole Love Call.\" This early piece showcases Ellington's adeptness at incorporating vocal textures and colors without the burden of lyrics, as well as his capacity to harmonize with the style of his soloists throughout his career. \"Creole Love Call\" is a 12-bar blues composition that unfolds over six choruses, each presenting a unique interplay between voice and instruments:\n\n- Chorus 1: A smooth, melodic vocal response, transitioning to a rougher sound midway.\n- Chorus 2: Muted trumpet solo, elaborating on the theme with extended blue notes.\n- Chorus 3: Soaring clarinet solo in the upper register, supported by a subtle, syncopated piano line.\n- Chorus 4: Full ensemble echo of the first chorus, with brass and reed sections engaging in a call and response.\n- Chorus 5: A climactic chorus, with reeds leading a high-register call and response, backed by syncopated stop-time from brass and rhythm sections.\n- Chorus 6: A return to the initial structure, with the voice adopting a growling technique to solo as an instrument.\n\n\"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded the following year, exemplifies Ellington's skill in tight orchestration and his ear for tone color. Here, a call and response between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing merges the vocal elements of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. Ellington's masterful use of Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these techniques, with Nanton introducing the melody to great effect.\n\nEllington's consistent use of voices to enrich the tonal palette of his compositions is a recurring theme in his work.",
            "An insatiable sense of yearning had been her constant companion since she was 14. This unquenched desire, now three years later, at 17, had shifted from a material need to a more personal one. Yet, no suitor had piqued her interest. Boys had courted her, but none sparked her curiosity or affections. This enigma baffled her, and years of introspection had yielded only theories that left her unsatisfied. Despite this inner turmoil, she lived her life, persistently questioning her desires.\n\nA typical day at home was usually tranquil. Her parents, serene individuals, rarely clashed with each other or their daughter. Their only discord was her independent streak. The only child of calm parents, she was known for her liveliness and kindness.\n\nToday, however, serenity eluded her. As she traversed the house seeking inspiration, her mother's anguished cry echoed from the kitchen. She rushed in, panic rising as she cried, \"Mom?! Mom, what happened?!\" Her mother lay on the floor, breathless and in pain. She knelt by her side, offering assistance. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to... the hospital.\" The urgency in her mother's voice conveyed her agony. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother guided her, and the daughter's training in physical strength proved invaluable as she carried her mother to the car.\n\nThe hospital's familiar scents of antiseptic and fear filled the air, but her mother's wellbeing consumed her thoughts. She rushed her mother in and called for help. Doctors swiftly appeared, wheeling her mother away. Left alone, she worried, her mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a high cabinet.",
            "This investigation sought to demonstrate the impact of adherence to the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as gauged by a high \"alternate Mediterranean diet score\" (aMed score), on the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, including stroke mortality. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes; monounsaturated fats in place of saturated fats; and fish, coupled with decreased intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPreviously conducted research has shown an inverse relationship between adherence to the Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality (CVD). An intervention trial found the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in achieving weight loss and lowering the total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. However, prior studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis longitudinal study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, with no history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Six times, between 1984 and 2004, an aMed score was calculated from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that measured nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses remained in the study for the entire 20-year period. FFQ data underwent validation. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical, hospital, autopsy, or death records. In cases where records were unavailable, incidents were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo mitigate individual random variation and reflect long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of aMed scores from repeated FFQs were computed. Adjustments were made for potential confounders, including age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazards modeling was employed to evaluate the association between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, utilizing separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke occurrences.\n\nHigher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was associated with a decreased risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over a 20-year follow-up period, 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combining fatal CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile showed a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk, 0.71).",
            "In the year 2007, the United States of America encountered a severe financial calamity. Unemployment surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous significant corporations were left in disarray. This economic downturn persists to this day, prompting us to investigate: what triggered this crisis, and how can we prevent its recurrence? Essentially, the financial crisis was sparked by a combination of self-serving and misguided political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into offering subprime loans within an inadequately developed financial framework. Simultaneously, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were compelled to underwrite and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves lacking sufficient capital reserves, which they then passed on to the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately spreading the chaos to the rest of the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown during the Clinton administration in 1999, as the President sought to secure a second term by boosting his popularity. To achieve this, the Clinton administration loosened lending restrictions, inadvertently paving the way for the subprime crisis seven years later. Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted the consequences of these actions: “Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced significant pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate-income individuals and felt pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive profit growth.” Holmes accurately foreshadowed the potential fallout: “However, the government-subsidized corporation could face difficulties in an economic downturn, potentially requiring a government bailout similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As highlighted in the introduction, and as Holmes predicted, reckless lending would inevitably lead to an economic meltdown.\n\nMultiple factors contributed to the economic downturn, one of which was the increasing complexity of mortgage structures. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used in the years preceding the crisis, further interlinking various economic sectors with the housing market. This overleveraging of households and financial markets in the housing sector made them highly susceptible to even minor fluctuations in price.\n\nThe housing bubble eventually burst, leaving financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities in disarray. In 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion worth of mortgage debts, which constituted approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at distressed prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transition into commercial banks under intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were taken under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the beginning stages of a narrative—where the wings are tested, and the audience either soars or drifts off into a slumber, often with a glare and a finger hovering over the back button. Dr. Merlin has been known to lash out at her screen during these moments, evidenced by the telltale echo of her frustrated screams. Exposition, it turns out, is not always a welcome visitor.\n\nWhile the maxim \"Show, don't tell\" may be well-known, Dr. Merlin often finds herself entangled in dense passages where action is scarce, or, even worse, overloaded with trivia. Exposition is the whisper in your ear, urging you to rush through the past to get to the points of interest. It's not the same as the voice urging you to share every minutiae of your characters' backgrounds.\n\nExposition, by definition, is the sharing of information, typically in a straightforward manner. In a film, this might be the character who monologues about their life's history, akin to a character from \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In literature, it's the author doing the talking.\n\nConsider this: you're reading a story where the heroine meets her beloved, they marry, and he is killed in front of her. You wouldn't expect this entire sequence to unfold in two pages, with each of them uttering only a couple of lines. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing through his words and actions how deeply he feels for his wife. Similarly, the heroine should demonstrate through her actions how his presence enriched her life. This would allow you to feel his death as if it were your own, and thus, connect with the heroine more deeply.\n\nIn essence, you need to provide substance to the skeletal structure of your plot: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, it's tempting to gloss over some details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character who used to be in the Air Force, now works as a night manager of a gas station, has been married twice, no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, dreams of owning the place one day, and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. But remember, these details should be revealed gradually, naturally weaving into the fabric of the story, not dumped all at once.",
            "I monitored two broadcasts originating from Columbus, Ohio yesterday. The first was a live report on NBC 4 (August 13, 2011). The main news item featured a disturbance involving a man named Shad Hostettler in Ashley, Ohio, who allegedly stabbed his spouse. The victim's identity was withheld, but the suspect's image was broadcast. The report was concise, devoted barely two minutes to the unfolding case, yet I found it proportionate to the story's development. The second story involved an early morning shooting in Sharon Woods, leaving an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers, critically injured. No arrests were made, and the SWAT team was continuing the investigation. This story was brief, a situation I've observed with minority victims of crimes, who often receive less media attention compared to white victims.\n\nThe next segment covered a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Details were provided about the incident, as well as the caliber of the bullet, a .22 from a rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasts for Saturday afternoon's rain and thunderstorms were brief, designed to entice viewers to stay tuned. Another report discussed a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus, involving a dark-skinned black man dressed in a hooded sweatshirt. His description included height and weight. I found the emphasis on his race unusual. The final story involved Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug kingpin sentenced for marijuana distribution. Instead of stating his sentence as 25 years, he was described as receiving \"300\" months. His ethnicity was also mentioned, which seemed unnecessary to the story.",
            "The connection between brothers is profound, an unyielding force that encompasses a myriad of feelings: affection, admiration, envy, and even malice, among others. This bond is unique, allowing brothers to comprehend one another on a level that transcends ordinary relationships. When challenges arise, this bond reveals itself in its entirety, whether it’s in its positive or negative aspects. These emotions, when revealed, carry substantial weight. Understanding the emotions born from this sibling link involves grappling with the repercussions they bring. When one looks into their brother’s eyes, they see not just their own reflection, but their true essence. The actions and their outcomes define their genuine character. In the story “The Scarlet Ibis,” two brothers navigate this theme, along with the intense emotions that accompany it. Their journey unfolds amidst a vivid, richly described landscape. A bittersweet clash of disillusionment and immense pride unfolds in the pivotal scene, with only one brother emerging alive. This theme is conveyed through the protagonist, Doodle, and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator’s perspective, which conveys the intricate emotions experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist’s actions can be distilled into a single emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful adventure, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle. He yearned for a brother who could learn all his skills, such as “holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a companion who could join him in “racing to Horsehead Landing…and perching with him in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Alas, these aspirations were dashed by Doodle’s extreme heart condition, making it unlikely he would survive, let alone engage in strenuous activities. The disappointment was immense for the young protagonist, whose mind was filled with grand dreams. Even so, he harbored some anger towards the young child, contemplating suffocating him with a pillow. Such thoughts are chilling, but they melted away when Doodle smiled at him. This moment of hope showed that the protagonist’s resolve was not steadfast. Deep down, there was a natural affection for his brother.",
            "The human cerebrum is an intricate, imaginative data translator. As tech evolved from rudimentary to contemporary, the analogies invoked to depict the brain have similarly evolved. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, subsequently to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As your understanding of the brain deepens, keep in mind that the utility of these metaphors is restricted and can lead to fallacies.\n\nData processing commences with input from the sensory organs, transmuting tangible stimuli such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light particles into electrochemical signals. The sensory data is repeatedly transformed by the brain's algorithms in both bottom-up and top-down modes. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black box against a white backdrop, bottom-up processing integrates simple data like hue, direction, and border placement – where hue shifts abruptly – to conclude that you're seeing a box. Top-down processing leverages decisions made at certain stages of the bottom-up process to expedite your recognition of the box. In this example, top-down processing might assist in identifying the object as a black box, not a box-shaped void in the white background.\n\nOnce data is partially processed, an attention sieve determines its significance and which cognitive processes it should be accessible to. For example, while your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention sieve prevents you from noticing each one individually. Conversely, you might pick out your name even in a noisy room. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results are modulated by attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process data, it must first be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded. Each type of sensory stimulus has specific encoding methods. For instance, verbal input can be encoded structurally, phonemically, or semantically. Once stored, information must be sustained. Certain animal studies propose that working memory, which holds information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal cycling through a specific neuronal circuit for a brief duration. Data in long-term memory is hypothesized to be preserved in the structure of particular proteins.\n\nNumerous models describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, some rooted in human memory retrieval, others in computer science, and others in neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that there are nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, Brave New World, the author critically examines the encroaching dangers of technological advancements and the capitalist framework that underpins them. The society depicted in the novel values collective harmony over individuality, with citizens conditioned from birth to prioritize immediate gratification above all else. The people are pawns in a larger scheme orchestrated by the World Controller, serving as a manifestation of Huxley's concerns about the rise of these systems. Through a Marxist lens, it is apparent that Huxley's novel is a critique of the burgeoning economic landscape of his time.\n\nCapitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness, where the common populace is deluded about their true economic standing. They are primarily concerned with personal gain, a result of ideological control by the ruling class. This is evident in Brave New World's portrayal of the lower classes, Delta and Gamma, who are conditioned to consume and indulge, manipulated by the World Controller. Hegemony, the domination of one social class by another, is explicit in this context, with the lower classes unwittingly supporting the status quo of capitalism and consumerism. Even the upper classes, the Alphas and Betas, though aware, largely accept their station, with characters like Bernard being exceptions. The interactions between social classes, as will be elaborated upon, are telling indicators of perceived capitalist oppression.\n\nIn Brave New World, personal relationships are almost nonexistent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth, hinting that technology and capitalism together strip individuals of free will and expression. Emotions are kept superficial, with men only commenting on women's physical attributes, and women discussing their encounters openly. This superficiality reflects the societal class structure's complacency, mirroring Marxist theories about the proletariat's false sense of superiority as long as they continue to consume and comply. Their unquestioning obedience to their position in the hierarchy underscores the socioeconomic impact of capitalism.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, translating to roughly four and a half semesters. Navigating campus can be a challenge for many, including myself. Freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dorm, situated quite far eastward on campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Journeying from Stuart Hall to classes in locations such as Willard building, near the campus center, could take up to 25 minutes on foot, especially in State College's capricious weather. Engaging with an alum, I discovered that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated by vast tracts of unused land. Today, this expanse has evolved into sports fields, new structures like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartments. As our campus expands, traversing between locations becomes increasingly arduous. So, what's the ideal solution to campus mobility? Bicycles seem to be the answer. However, bicycles alone won't remedy the issue. Students must ride them, and the campus must be designed with cyclists in mind.\n\nSpeaking with a friend who recently resumed cycling after a hiatus, he mentioned, “Bikes are fantastic; for a while, they weren't cool, but they're the only feasible way to get around.” Besides being physically beneficial, bicycling is an efficient mode of travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can cover 30 miles or more. Like many peers, I now live off campus, equidistant from the campus center as some dorms. My wisest decision this year was investing in a bike. My daily commute to Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from home, can be reduced to 5 minutes by cycling swiftly. The primary challenge lies in Pollock Road, the direct route to Thomas, which isn't always smooth sailing. Walking is viable, but my schedule is too hectic to accommodate it. Without my bike, walking would be my sole dependable option, adding an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily commute. That equates to over two and a half hours weekly, not to mention other instances of walking to classes, appointments, and more. That's time better spent elsewhere."
