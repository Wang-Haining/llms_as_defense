            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

Here, I am determined to lend a helping hand to children affected by abuse or neglect, and to support vulnerable families in distress. The values I aim to bring to this field are service, respect, integrity, a commitment to fostering healthier relationships, and a resolve to continually enhance my professional skills. These core principles are not just integral to social work, but are deeply ingrained within me personally.\n\nMy initial fascination with helping others was sparked in high school and college, witnessing individuals retreat from their challenges in denial or employing unhealthy coping strategies. Unsure of my professional direction, I pursued a Bachelor’s in Psychology. Post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a year off to explore my options. During this time, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police. Impelled by a desire to assist, I drove to his parents’ house. After speaking with the police, I intervened with the parents, who seemed defensive and attributed their son’s distress to his “manipulative” behavior. This encounter ignited a resolve within me to pursue social work and support children navigating family conflicts.\n\nThe principle of social justice is a pillar that resonates strongly in the field of social work. Our society lauds the individual, yet often, our societal norms propagate conformity rather than uniqueness. If we genuinely mourn those who perish, why do we strive to emulate the masses? I stand for individuality and have consistently challenged social injustices throughout my academic years. My actions include unconventional hair colors, personalized clothing choices, and piercing beyond the norm, as well as advocating for equality within the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and opposing racism and discrimination.

            "The following investigation delves into the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives concerning the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model centers on inherited genetic information and health-related facets. Conversely, the Sociocultural models examine environmental factors and their impact on demographics such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia explores these models, presenting specific research to elucidate them. The research findings are subsequently evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, secondary sleep disorders, and those due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, whereas secondary sleep disorders are linked to mental disorders or other medical complications. Dyssomnias encompass a range of sleep issues like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, while Parasomnias involve behavioral and physiological disturbances during sleep. The review focuses primarily on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with a broader look at their relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic and physiological aspects. Orexin neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study utilizing mice demonstrated that the GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and sleep. Administration of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that human models can be extrapolated from these findings. This implies that genetic and environmental factors influence the physical GABAB receptor in humans, potentially disrupting sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could naturally regulate sleep, impacting daily tasks and focus.",
            "This composition delves into three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a succinct definition of the disorder is presented. Secondly, the diagnostic process is elucidated, including notable symptoms, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with strategies that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom setting can employ to assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), \"refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and generates electrophysiologic auditory potentials\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning individuals with CAPD may not properly interpret what they hear, despite normal hearing ability. Their brains do not effectively translate sounds into comprehensible information, such as separating words or discerning conversation from background noise.\n\n\tThe earliest reference to the disorder that evolved into CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, known as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers examined children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 sparked increased research on children with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD presents in various forms: individuals may struggle to locate or discern sounds in space, discriminate between multiple acoustic events, recognize sound patterns, identify changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm), be obstructed when one sound is followed by another, have difficulty synthesizing sound clues, or determine the sequence of auditory information presented (Ferre).\n\n\tTo diagnose CAPD, a patient must undergo a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, which may be administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others using various measures that assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This could include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, responses to specific stimuli, or more advanced tests recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses. There is no singular diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder at present.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while impersonation can indeed aid in sustaining prolonged deceptions, it ultimately necessitates the disavowal of one's assumed persona, lest one becomes irrevocably entangled within it. Yet, terminating a deception presents its own set of predicaments, as one might find themselves estranged from those around them. The quandary then lies in choosing between the preservation of one's true self and the sustenance of relationships with others. While some may react indifferently to the revelation of deception, others may feel betrayed and offended by the ruse.\n\nThe theme of gender disguise poses a particular challenge, raising questions like why one might feel compelled to assume the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola's case, it is clear that her transformation is a strategy for self-preservation: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249) Arriving in a foreign land, Viola adopts a male persona to safeguard herself from potential harm. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from female company, depriving her of vital support. Moreover, Viola's successful impersonation leads Olivia to confuse her with Sebastian and fall in love: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) Additionally, she must manage her suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nDespite this, \"Twelfth Night\" might be interpreted as demonstrating how deception can catalyze the expression of suppressed emotions, particularly in the instances of Olivia and Orsino. Some passages hint that these characters may harbor unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario due to his apparent maleness, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It is doubtful that Olivia's affections are truly romantic, as Shakespeare's character often satirizes those who judge others solely based on appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The harsh realities of German colonial rule, particularly the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa, have been widely documented. However, a comprehensive understanding of the empire's educational landscape cannot be reduced to such a simplistic portrayal. The German colonial empire was characterized by a great disparity in policies and governance across its various territories, as well as in the educational provisions it offered. While the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919 revealed a significant populace of educated and literate Africans, Germany's educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were also acknowledged by contemporary observers. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively promoted state-run schools and played a pivotal role in the education of indigenous populations, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government backing. Meanwhile, the government allocated substantial resources to European education, establishing a robust system of state schools and actively supporting and overseeing missionary institutions. These educational policies had enduring ramifications for South West Africa, even after the departure of German rule. Despite the presence of literate and educated Africans in other German colonies, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the populace remained uneducated and illiterate.\" A range of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors in depth, with a focus on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous population.\nResearch on education within the German colonial empire is extensive, with many sources originating from the early twentieth century and written in German. These early works primarily sought to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language studies expanded this discourse through comparative analyses and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's work, which compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, is particularly notable. Cohen attributes many of South West Africa's distinctive educational features to its substantial settler population.\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa enjoyed a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This made the colony more hospitable to European settlers. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, whereas only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the last century to encompass an extensive array of genres. The sheer number of these genres has made it challenging to enumerate them all collectively, as many—from rap to rock, country to jazz, and folk—have birthed multiple subgenres and subsubgenres. Notably, the subgenre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive genres within the realm of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressive nature is evident through its wide-ranging emotional spectrum, though it often veers toward the darker nuances. The genre's flexibility has fostered the creation of numerous subgenres and subsubgenres, with this chain of diversification continuing to this day. Today, the heavy metal scene has fragmented into so many niches that defining the core essence of heavy metal has become an arduous task. It has infiltrated themes from various other genres, yet it finds its roots in a specific source. To comprehend the sprawling landscape of metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and its status as a movement, rather than merely a genre.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. It is distinguished by a departure from primitivism and an emphasis on technical proficiency, with musicians showcasing their skills through their instruments. Moreover, metal is inherently tied to the influence of substance use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom catalyzed a surge in experimental, otherworldly recordings, with drugs serving as a conduit for musical exploration. This genre possesses raw, visceral qualities, which was a novel departure from the mainstream music's emotional palette. Furthermore, subsequent generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from the song \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify the darker themes that are integral to the movement. This song, considered by some as one of the pioneers of Heavy Metal, was a response to a Rolling Stones track that leaned heavier and darker, with The Beatles aiming to prove their ability to match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Decades prior to the Surrealists' inception of their dreamlike art, an artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. The Dream, Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, is not merely a depiction of a woman captivated by her dream landscape; it also encapsulates his personal aspirations and internal conflict. Throughout his career, he yearned for acceptance, respect, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, yet faced a troublesome dilemma: should he conform to or mimic established painting styles to gain recognition, or should he maintain his unique creative independence? To fully appreciate The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's biographical narrative. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau hails from humble beginnings. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity. Lacking formal artistic training, Rousseau worked as a municipal toll service employee until the age of forty, earning the nickname \"douanier.\" After his first wife's death and the tragic loss of eight infant children, leaving him with just one daughter, Julia, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike his contemporaries, who often glorified peasant life in their art, Rousseau was a self-taught folk artist, embodying the hopes and dreams of his working-class peers.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance in the art world is not merely understandable but also plausible, given his circumstances. He lacked formal training, started his artistic journey later in life, and coexisted with better-known contemporaries. The book Modern French Painters by Jan Gordon clarifies the distinction between Rousseau and contemporaries such as Matisse: \"Matisse was driven by a fear of clichéd painting, whereas Rousseau's aim was to create a conventional work that would secure his admission to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous philosophers have suggested a profound intertwining of ethics and aesthetics, of truth and beauty. I hold that at the core of this lies a reason, one which John Keats articulated in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of life's knowledge comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to value ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction. Both are attempts to describe rather than prescribe, seeking explanations for beauty or morality rather than rules for judgment. Art and moral criticism often fall short in capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discussion of the Mona Lisa's worth might delve into technical details, but these don't capture why it's great art. We frequently use phrases like \"There's just something about it\" to describe our favorites. Both art and morality resist complete description. Flannery O'Connor and Wittgenstein echo this, emphasizing the ineffable nature of both. This \"je ne sais quoi\" in art and morality is their most potent trait, linking them. As McKean suggests, literature's moral quality is unique, as it uniquely engages our values and life itself. This noumenal impact, where we experience but can't fully explain, strengthens this link.",
            "Present-day Germany is regarded as a formidable entity, a cohesive nation that is home to diverse cultural elements, from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This unique cultural tapestry can be felt in cities like Cologne on the Rhine, spanning the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given this rich cultural heritage, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a fusion of various influences and tribes.\n\nThe nomenclature \"Germania\" is shrouded in historical debate. Some scholars attribute the name to a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to engage in conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98 AD). Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, utilized the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and those he hadn't, borrowing it from the Gauls themselves (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the term may derive from the Germanic word for spear, \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish term \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud or noisy nature (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous and unmixed by other races. He pondered, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its harsh landscape, inclement skies, and sullen demeanor, unless it were their native land?\" (Tacitus, 98 AD). Meanwhile, the Romans, with their extensive empire, typically sent their conquests into Germania for trade and occasionally led land campaigns before returning home (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).\n\nAs Germanic tribes began surfacing in the first century, they lived on the outskirts of the Roman Empire, trading their land-derived goods and military skills within the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "Gazing downwards, I observed the scene before me, my mind blank and unfeeling.  I was an impartial spectator, studying the image without attaching any personal interpretation or emotion.  Thoughts came and went, as if on a conveyor belt, I merely witnessed them.  I felt no sense of ownership over my thoughts, just a fluid awareness of the visual data presented.  I had, once upon a time, been advised by an artistic colleague to purchase a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  My enthusiasm for drawing had begun at age six, and this book delved into the fundamentals, from the nature of pencils to the brain's interpretative processes.  One method it taught was to visualize a square frame around any subject, transforming complex scenes into manageable units.  Standing before the bowl, I was awestruck, unable to impose this technique.  The room was filled with the grandeur of art history, from Picasso's blue phase to Monet's greenery, and I felt a sense of inadequacy, but also a spark of inspiration.  I picked up my tool, muscles tensing and relaxing, my thoughts shaping the action.  The toilet, however, was less cooperative, the offending brown mass defying my attempts to dislodge it.  After a few futile attempts, I resorted to wrapping the toilet paper around my hand like an oven mitt, then slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, reminiscent of a mother preparing a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The youth of America face a significant threat on our highways—teen drivers, numerous fatalities. This state of affairs is a convergence of several factors. The National Institutes of Health provide that a key challenge is the developing teenage brain, not yet equipped to navigate driving's perils. Inexperience is another culprit, leading to more fatal crashes, frequent rollovers, excessive speeding, and road departures. Peer influence exacerbates the problem, as teens often drive with their friends, a practice any sensible person would acknowledge.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses restricting teen driving hours and barring minor passengers. However, these are mere band-aids, the core issue being that collectively, young drivers lack the skill set to manage driving's hazards. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman contends that even 18 is too young for unrestricted driving. He has found that teens under 19-20 crave thrills, increasing risk-taking.\n\nThus, delaying driving until this tendency subsides would be prudent. Failure to do so may lead to escalating fatalities. By 2010, the Baby Boomer children will be eligible, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nA feasible legislative solution could involve continuing driver education in schools but barring teens under 18 from driving. Provisional permits could be issued, with the same practical training hours as most states. Uniform national legislation would be logical and effective in safeguarding teens nationwide.\n\nThe proposed legislation isn't uncharted territory.",
            "Upon sifting through the Library of Congress's archives, I encountered a collection of early Edison films, specifically fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films are notable for their clever editing techniques, which create illusions. My analysis, primarily, was centered around elucidating the poetic elements of the majority of these trick films and scrutinizing the outliers in the latter films. Generally, the trick films of the turn of the century were confined within the boundaries of a stage, employing a frontal proscenium, static camera positioning, and a strict adherence to long and medium shots, with each shot comprising a complete film. Yet, some films at the dawn of the twentieth century did diverge from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prevailing similarity amongst these trick films is their filming within a stationary interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed, never moving to follow figures or objects. This compositional choice was deeply rooted in the theatre and vaudeville traditions, particularly for trick films. However, this static stage setup constrains movement to horizontal, with figures moving side-to-side without approaching or receding from the camera. Consider the sequence in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, yet the camera does not track them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium format also dictates shot lengths, with long shots being the norm and medium shots less frequent. Close-ups are entirely absent. This adherence to theatrical and vaudevillian traditions, where the audience views the entire performance at once, framed by the stage, eliminates close-ups, with actors not moving towards the camera. The format of one conceptual shot per film limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on frames per second. This also restricts their narrative or dramatic potential, with most focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks, like magic, disappearing acts, or switches, with minimal story. Notably, in a trick film, a conceptual shot in the viewer's perception is not equivalent to a physical shot. A single \"shot\" may comprise multiple physically distinct shots joined to create an illusion, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A closer examination reveals the precise moment when the physical shot of Mary's \"severed head\" begins, despite the film appearing as a single unified shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and passionate advocate for the Republican cause. His background in agriculture and a brief political career instilled in him a tenacious commitment to individual liberties and governance. His agricultural pursuits and political experiences shaped his views on government, with his promotion of an agrarian system as the cornerstone of his beliefs on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor envisioned a unique opportunity for the United States to establish an ideal governance system, free from native traditions that could hinder its creation. He firmly believed in the inherent interdependence of natural rights, asserting that denying one right diminishes the value of all. Consequently, he argued that these rights should be shielded from government interference.\n\nIn his quest for an ideal society, Taylor held that a government must acknowledge the good and evil within humanity. He adhered to a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and subdue capitalism, and believed that a government founded on such principles would function equitably despite its administrators' potential self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimalist Federal government, restricting its powers to those explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could become oppressive due to its cost. However, he cautioned that a purely literal interpretation could lead to corruption, necessitating consideration of the writers' intent. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly describes the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "Upon reviewing Figure 17, it was observed that commuter log submissions plummeted in the third month of the project. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reason behind it was not readily apparent. Considering that this period coincides with the onset of winter in a New England locale, it's plausible that the dip in bicycle and pedestrian commuting played a role. Additionally, December marks the end of the academic semester, leaving many preoccupied with final tasks and grading, which could have led to the log submisions being overlooked. Furthermore, December is a holiday month, with a subsequent break for both students and faculty, reducing campus attendance significantly. The resumption of classes in late January might also explain the low number of February submissions. However, the dip in February remains unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for such projects often wanes over time. To address this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did manage to boost log submissions. Thus, one challenge was sustaining project momentum amidst natural ebbs and academic breaks.\n\nAnother significant hurdle for this project, and similar initiatives, is the widespread preference for driving. This behavior is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it's crucial to offer incentives to encourage alternative modes of commuting. We offered various prizes, including gift cards for local businesses and even a few national chains. It's intriguing to consider whether even larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have further increased participation. The value of these prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing their value over time could have potentially boosted engagement. While gift cards seemed sufficient at the outset, announcing more substantial prizes in December and January might have enticed more participation and mitigated the initial decline.",
            "An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a financial product that mirrors an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to an index fund, yet offers more flexibility as it trades like a stock on an exchange. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs provide the benefits of diversification and ownership akin to single stocks, including short selling, margin buying, and purchasing as little as one share per transaction. Despite these advantages, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. However, there are trade-offs; every ETF transaction incurs a commission, similar to stock trades. Another plus side is the broad range of available funds. It is prudent for discerning investors to scrutinize these claimed benefits, ensuring they exist and are substantial. For this study, we examine ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, accounting for 63.58% of its assets, to assess whether owning a single ETF yields benefits similar to a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks. We also explore if there's a more optimal stock configuration offering a better Sharpe ratio or return.",
            "A notable work in Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre is \"Dream-Land,\" which he esteemed amongst his finest creations. In this piece, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. Virgil, in turn, employed this term to denote an island beyond the northern reaches of Britain, an extremity of the known world to the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, a more contemporary influence could be acknowledged. Poe, fascinated by German literature, would have encountered this term through his readings of Goethe.\n\nThis is of significance as it illuminates Poe's intimacy with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his tome \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallel lines between the two poets' compositions, suggesting Poe's imitation of Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature lauds Goethe as a luminary of poetic drama, particularly for his magnum opus \"Faust,\" released in two installments, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the latter part of Faust, a short poem entitled \"The King of Thule\" appears, depicting a monarch whose life unravels after the death of his wife and the gifting of a goblet. Driven to despair, he ultimately sacrifices himself and his possessions, save for the goblet, which he casts into the sea. This narrative bears a striking resemblance to the emotional landscape of \"Dream-Land,\" with its melancholic speaker haunted and desolate, echoing Poe's grief and possibly his own struggles with alcohol.\n\nPoe's invocation of Thule is not isolated to \"Dream-Land\"; he employs the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" The use of the term as bookends in \"Dream-Land\" further underscores its significance. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with the latter's dark, lonely Thule mirroring Goethe's desolate king and his own poignant loss. The speaker's description of this realm as a haunted, colorless, and shaded world resonates with the despair of Goethe's king, as if Poe had stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe's importance cannot be overstated; Poe would have been familiar with his works, at the very least through Tennyson's admiration for him. When queried about his esteem for Tennyson, Poe also expressed his respect for Goethe, likely having encountered his works through various reproductions.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a customer injured following a slip-and-fall on a spilled applesauce in a supermarket be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with ill intent because he was informed of the spill twice and did not clear it for half an hour due to dining?A judge is unlikely to promptly dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To establish that punitive damages are merited, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with willful and deliberate disregard for probable harm, as well as evidence that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple incidents of slipping had occurred prior to her accident, and despite this knowledge, he failed to address the issue. While Palmer's assertion that Martin's actions were reprehensible is less convincing, it remains reasonable under the circumstances, considering six slip-and-fall incidents had transpired in 2009 and Martin still failed to implement adequate measures to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, Richard Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, notified his supervisor, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and \"didn't have time to handle customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Mr. Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. By 5:30 PM on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a severe back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five separate slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial dismissal of the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" id. at § (c)(1). Courts have labeled conduct as malicious when, knowing the probable harmful consequences, a defendant deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Nearly four years ago, I encountered a course on Islam at CBC, where the class frequently debated the contentious issue of whether Islam is inherently hostile. The relevance of this discussion appears to have grown since then, particularly in light of recent global events and the shifting public perception of Islam in the United States. In the aftermath of 9/11, for instance, there's been a noticeable shift from a hostile portrayal of Islam and extremism to an extreme form of tolerance, even to the extent that a candidate with a Muslim background, such as President Barack Obama, could be elected in 2008.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad captures my curiosity as the narrative diverges from historical accounts of his life. In my previous understanding, Muhammad was perceived as a conqueror who compelled tribes to adopt Islam through force. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr who endured misunderstanding and humility. This version of events implies that people increasingly sought out Muhammad after witnessing his teachings' truth.\n\nCertain parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad also intrigue me. For example, the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men echoes the biblical story of Jesus' feeding of the five thousand. This style of storytelling suggests a deliberate attempt to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, emphasizing his acts of truth and miracle, rather than necessitating proofs. This approach, I believe, diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and miracles.\n\nMoreover, many stories in the biography seem to serve an agenda of demonstrating the voluntary nature of conversions to Islam. These accounts often rely on third-party accounts, with information passed down through multiple intermediaries. While intended to bolster the credibility of the stories, this method can actually undermine their authenticity, as it adds layers of hearsay.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a pious, wise, and gentle leader. Historical records contradict this depiction, suggesting a more complex and sometimes harsh figure. Given this disparity, it makes me wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the full spectrum of Muhammad's history and rise to power.",
            "The precepts and convictions espoused by Jesus during his tenure were promptly cast aside as Christian thought evolved post-mortem. A cursory examination of this trajectory reveals a steady drift away from the origin. The contemporary world exhibits an increasing consciousness and an unparalleled progressive inclination. While the traditionalists persist, their influence may not be extensive enough to dictate the whole. Among the adherents, historical acumen will surge in the coming years, sparking a desire to discern the principles appended to Christianity over time from the authentic intentions of its namesake. This pendulum swing may take decades or even centuries, but the reversal is assured: Christianity will revert to its primordial form. A swell will emerge, peeling back the layers of doctrine, much like the hands of a clock turning backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this wave sweeps across the United States and Europe, swaying the masses to revere as if we were living in Jesus' time, following solely his thoughts, the institutional church will remain steadfast in guiding the way. However, with the theological clock reversed, the proliferation of diversity within Christendom will diminish, giving way to uniformity of belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and sectarian differences will yield to growing similarities. History is replete with such reversals. Case in point: Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, yet the empire later became a Christian power. Our nation has evolved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversal in Christianity will unfold, undoing history to return to the source and diminishing diversity in its path. This progression hinges on an interpretative approach to Jesus' words, viewing them as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what has transpired since Jesus' life?\n       A deep dive into history reveals that Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity, was predominant. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were the bedrock of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish populace was not unified; they were divided into groups such as Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "The narrative of \"The Jungle\" reveals the inherent inclination of humans to prioritize self-interest and disregard the well-being of others. In Sinclair's world, the executives and overseers of the sprawling factories represent this self-serving nature. They are solely focused on amassing power and wealth, oblivious to the havoc their actions wreak. The author employs vivid imagery to highlight the consequences of their unchecked ambition, \"The buildings stood tall and proud against the sky, their smokestacks spewing clouds of smoke that stretched towards infinity.\" This visual is a stark depiction of the environmental devastation caused by their relentless pursuit of progress.\n\nThe indifference extends to the employees, who are mere tools in their pursuit of profit. Workers are subject to grueling schedules and sudden layoffs without recompense, all in the name of maximizing efficiency. In the absence of protective regulations, exploitation was rife. The employers held a stranglehold over their workforce, much like slave owners, with workers having no recourse or support. The narrative hints at the dehumanizing conditions, \"The workers, many of whom were immigrants, lived in a perpetual state of poverty and desperation, their lives contingent on the caprices of their masters.\" Unions, intended to advocate for the workers, often exacerbated the suffering, further entrenching the system of exploitation that defined Packingtown.",
            "Multiple authors deploy varied methods to evoke specific sentiments in their audiences. Among these techniques, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to impart a certain vibe around a subject. He also ascribes significance to symbols and uses them to achieve the same effect. In his work, Fitzgerald assigns meaning to numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. He builds up these meanings and subsequently employs them to trigger certain emotions when encountering significant objects.\n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, with white connoting elegance and sophistication, and gray symbolizing age and weariness. He establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white,\" and even Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party. Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. The only departure from this white prevalence occurs when Nick is first introduced to Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors.\" This color coding extends to various mundane subjects, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, and even the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. Fitzgerald further reinforces this uniformity by describing common people or places in these colors, including the \"white girlhood\" of Jordan and Daisy, and the \"gray\" Italian child on the railroad.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he uses white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy, who, after a prolonged absence of either color in the story, is described as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" Readers begin to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform addition, a mere object of Gatsby's desire. This use of color continues with references to a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her being in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County, due to its temperate and sunny climate, is a notable agricultural powerhouse. Crops that flourish here include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the region, with several local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms not only offer tours of their operations but also facilitate activities like hiking and birdwatching. Such enterprises can leverage government programs to enhance habitat quality, create recreational spaces, and generate income or educational opportunities. Organic farming, while more demanding in terms of labor and management, can foster greater biodiversity. However, it may also incur higher costs and experience greater crop losses. Non-organic practices beneficial to wildlife can also add to labor expenses. Thus, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to balance profits and habitat conservation. The selected land is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, home to over a hundred species, many endangered or declining. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later used by cattle ranchers. The property was originally part of a homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production. Researching available government programs and exploring a nearby organic farm provided insights into potential cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices.",
            "Cultural nuances are pivotal in any negotiation. Culture isn't just about what it is, but also what it isn't and the meaning behind it. It's diverse, multifaceted, and not universally uniform. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad and oversimplified. While understanding cultural norms is beneficial, it's more productive to grasp how a culture's values influence negotiation dynamics. When interacting with foreign cultures, one tends to compare them to their own, which can be insightful but also misleading.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset might involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of attempting to alter or judge a culture, one should accept it as is and operate within its parameters, especially when negotiations are involved, and particularly if one is in a weaker position. Being on \"foreign\" turf necessitates respect for traditions and beliefs, which can transcend cultural hurdles and facilitate negotiations.\n\nCulture isn't confined to national or international contexts. Many companies within a nation develop their own unique corporate culture, evident in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and attitudes towards philanthropy. Even within a single nation, corporate cultures can vary widely, as seen in the differences between American companies. Some cultures appear more uniform, but a closer look reveals their varied nuances.\n\nValues are crucial to decipher, as they explain why a culture behaves a certain way. If preserving face or promoting harmony is valued, a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes aggressive negotiations won't settle quickly. Recognizing these cultural priorities before negotiations is essential, but learning about the other party's personal values can enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "\"In the Book of Psalms, it is written, 'The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is central to St. Anselm's reasoning regarding the existence of a deity, and it is also echoed by Thomas Aquinas. To evaluate their arguments, we'll presume they both adhere to the monotheistic belief of the Bible, as they are both defending the same divine figure. This assumption simplifies our comparison, as both arguments are rooted in the same concept of God.\n\nIn examining Anselm's approach, we find that it centers on an inner search for truth. He posits that God's existence can be derived from our understanding, as we cannot imagine His nonexistence. This concept, though complex and sometimes unclear, suggests that God's reality is intrinsic to our minds. Thus, the proof lies within us, requiring no external verification. This notion aligns with Christian teachings, which often refer to this as faith.\n\nConversely, Aquinas advocates for a rationale based on logical reasoning and empirical evidence. His method avoids faith entirely, making it more appealing for converting non-believers, as it relies on reasoning rather than accepting something unprovable. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument illustrates that God's existence is a necessary logical conclusion. If one lacks a single piece of a puzzle but can deduce its features and existence from the rest, this is analogous to Aquinas' logical arguments for God's existence.",
            "In the dawn of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a monarch-to-be, later revered as the Buddha, drew breath. His life's journey saw him forsake the world and achieve enlightenment, sparking the birth of Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being Theravada Buddhism. The religion, now over two and a half millennia old, bears little resemblance to its founders' time. This can be observed in Theravada-majority Sri Lanka, where the annual Maha Silavimokkha ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople participate, despite no mention of such rituals in the Buddha's teachings. These modifications extend from the most outward traditions to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, spanning both monastic and lay domains, has adapted its principles over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, both friendly and adversarial.\n\tTo navigate this discussion, several key terms will be frequently used. Here, internal forces refer to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation. External forces encompass those from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that pose a threat or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often due to misconceptions about Buddhism. Benign forces, meanwhile, do not wish to harm or aid the community, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will recur throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, let us examine the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism—the doctrines that underpin it. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the religion's metaphysical aspects, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth life's rules. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: I will not kill, I will not lie, I will not steal, I will not misbehave sexually, and I will not consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The most foundational doctrinal tenet is the four noble truths: life is Dukkha (suffering), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once faced a protracted dispute lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145) The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious and gained control of Texas and the southwestern territories. Multiple skirmishes occurred between these nations, tapering off just prior to the First World War. The rivalry stemmed from disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario mirrors many other nations that have ongoing rivalries with their neighbors. Shared borders often lead to conflicting interests, fostering rivalries. The United States and Mexico are no exception. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that “Only in Mexico and Cuba does one find enduring American diplomatic issues” (p. 41). Indeed, both nations, being geographically close to the United States, have historically been rivals, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious tensions have long divided these nations, a problem that has plagued many throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that “While in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similar to the Cold War, the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, this conflict was partly ideological and partly a competition over vital interests. However, the ideological differences were rooted in religious preferences rather than political systems. The distrust stemmed from earlier colonial tensions between the English and Spanish, which hindered the development of peaceful diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States over the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered around territorial issues, with border raids and frontier problems being significant concerns. Outlaw activities from American border towns into Mexican territory posed a major challenge, persisting until both nations strengthened their military presence on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States. It finally concluded with a shift in American ambitions, from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, towards the end of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen and unanticipated affliction rendered me incapacitated, an illness that I had never been made aware of. At that time, I was pursuing a career as a nurse, a choice made due to a profound desire for the safety and stability that I had lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always find employment; people will always require care\" became the mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Thus, even though my heart yearned to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a blend of both, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am: 46 years old, unmarried, possessing no financial reserves, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after 15 years of subsisting on Social Security Disability, I have nothing left that is truly mine. I manage to endure, but every day is a battle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing is certain anymore, yet there is one truth that stands unwavering: I could not have persevered for this long without the support of my kin and a few steadfast friends. And let me assure you, when calamity truly strikes, you feel far from invincible.\n\nThe crux of my argument is that life is full of unpredictability, both large and small. There are no guarantees, and despite our best efforts, some challenges are simply too immense to overcome alone.\n\nI am in complete agreement that we must cease placing all our hopes in the crumbling, leaky vessel that is our government. But I would much prefer to see Americans reclaim their trust in one another, learning to aid each other and to request assistance, rather than each of us retreating to our own backyards to construct fallout shelters.\n\nThe conservatives in the U.S. often extol the virtues of \"rugged individualism\" that supposedly built this nation; however, the resilience of our forefathers in times of hardship was not born of rugged individualism, but of compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who traversed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains did not reach the coast by relying solely on their own strength.\n\nAs such, I wholeheartedly recommend preparing for emergencies. I am well-equipped with a disaster kit, first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for my windows in the event of a biological attack. I possess multiple flashlights and an abundance of batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources to maintain a small farm and preserve your own food, do so. It is a commendable endeavor, as is the installation of a wood stove, provided you do not reside in an apartment.\n\nBut alongside these preparations, it is essential to forge connections with your neighbors.",
            "What drives the evolutionary trajectory of organisms? Are there inherent restrictions or constraints that steer the course of biological change? As D'Arcy Thompson acknowledged in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has barely begun to dream of defining in mathematical terms the simplest organic forms.\" While this sentiment still holds true, advancements in mathematical modeling have been made in understanding mollusk skeletogenesis throughout ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to unravel the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes in Prunum by integrating mathematical modeling with experimental studies. Using X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These models help interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, complementing experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a cylindrical structure that evolves over time through 360 degrees of space, with each loop or turn referred to as a whorl, spiraling around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The rate at which whorls expand varies, with a continuous boundary separating each one, called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl, known as the body whorl, is the last. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and base at the bottom. The aperture, an opening, is where the animal exits the shell.\n\nShells can be examined from various angles: apical (top view), basal (bottom view), apertural (front view), and abapertural (side view). The standard orientation places the aperture toward the viewer with the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and locating the first suture. Draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of apertures tracking the animal's growth over time and space. The path of the aperture can be tracked using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has shown little fluctuation. Despite Indonesia's progress towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements for child and maternal health remain insufficient to meet 2015 targets. Various factors contribute to these shortfalls, suggesting the need to bolster the healthcare system rather than solely focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled personnel, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot administer medical interventions during complex pregnancies, leading to maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, these improvements are somewhat deceptive and further work is needed. Additionally, the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea has declined. Data on postnatal care is incomplete but shows low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarian-section rates remain low, at 4%, with urban areas having a 7% rate compared to 2% in rural areas. This disparity highlights the issue of limited healthcare access, primarily in rural regions. Moreover, there's a 27% gap in service usage between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, indicating the poor struggle more to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nLooking forward to enhancing neonatal and maternal health indicators, the crucial question is how best to tackle the gap in service delivery. Should Indonesia adopt targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall healthcare system without focusing solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches offer clear, manageable objectives and quicker results, they can also lead to funding diversion and duplication of services. For instance, heavy investment in one sector, like HIV/AIDS, can divert resources from another like family planning.",
            "The Victorian period's literature is renowned for its meticulous detail and preoccupation with the upper class. Contrary to this, novels such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge, showcasing elements of intrigue and eccentricity that are atypical of the era. These novels use mystery, often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, to delve deeper into characters' motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his plight, and his inability to control his circumstances. The shooting scene in Chapter 28, a vivid dreamlike sequence, demonstrates Oliver's lack of control and the dire straits of his health. The passage emphasizes his desperation and the relentless fear and pain he experiences during the shooting, even as he is removed from the immediate shock. The incident suggests that Oliver's misfortune is not of his own making, reinforcing his helplessness and growing sense of defeat, as if old Fagin is breaking his spirit and stripping him of the ability to react. The shooting highlights the pervasive influence of his fate, which is not under his control. This is underscored by Oliver's inability to muster any response, even in the face of life-threatening danger. The shooting, in this context, serves as a stark reminder of his powerlessness and the extent to which he is a pawn in the hands of external forces.",
            "A few years back, I participated in an after-school program assisting elementary-aged students with their studies. I offered my best efforts to help them in their areas of need, with a particular aptitude for English and reading. An instructor approached me, requesting my assistance with a young boy named Adrian, presumably in third or fourth grade, who was grappling with reading difficulties. It became evident that something was amiss; his pronunciation of certain letters was flawless, while others were completely off. Intrigued, I discovered that Adrian, of Latino descent, spoke English flawlessly but struggled with the alphabet. This revelation occurred when I encountered Adrian's mother, who only communicated in Spanish. Despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to convey our thoughts. It dawned on me that Adrian could read well but lacked familiarity with the English alphabet. I hope Adrian's reading skills improved since then.\n\nI share this anecdote to highlight the challenges posed by language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also illustrates the complexity of reading difficulties, even for students who speak English fluently. The issue is evident, so what is the solution? In Adrian's case, English reading tutoring, particularly focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is multifaceted and complex. No single approach can solve the problem; the key lies in combining various strategies.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a promising approach. Not only for Spanish-speaking students, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There's a misconception that this system wastes resources and benefits only a select few. This is untrue. If implemented as the norm, all children would reap its benefits. How can we achieve this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Instead, special bilingual aids or tutors could be employed to support this system.",
            "Since childhood, we're often introduced to the notion that there's something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some of us attend religious institutions to learn about it, while others explore within ourselves for answers. Many of us inherit and embrace the faiths passed down by our ancestors, while others reject them entirely. Our paths differ, each one carving out a unique spiritual identity. We all search for guidance in the darkness to guide us into the light.\n\nMy father, when I inquired about his favorite bird, replied \"A cardinal.\" We sat on our porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above, as we shared cigarettes. The gutters emptied the rain, drowning the plants around us. He gazed into the rain, lost in thought, thinner and weaker than I remembered. His hair had thinned, his clothes loose on his frame. He stared ahead, evading my gaze. I felt isolated, anxious, unable to discuss my fears with him. I embraced him, moved my chair closer, and gazed with him into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments prolonged his suffering, but only by a few months. I couldn't watch him depart this life. I wanted to honor his memory as he lived, not as he died. I curled up in bed for three days, awaiting news.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The conventional \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially a synthesis of \"old\" and \"new\" elements, as elucidated by Ian Watt in his seminal work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This literary mode has been simultaneously maligned and celebrated, with critics alternately accusing it of superficiality and lauding its 'terrifying grandeur' (Burke). The inception of the \"Gothic Novel\" can be traced back to The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole, which blended both archaic and contemporary romance tropes to birth the fledgling Gothic genre and introduce a novel method of storytelling. Walpole deftly incorporated old theatrical elements and modern mimetic techniques in his \"Gothic Tale\" (Walpole 4), creating a unique fusion that drew from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Despite the word \"gothic\" being used to denote various peoples, styles, and eras, it was often viewed as antiquated or unsophisticated amidst the literary and societal advancements of the time. The marriage of these 'Gothic' elements with the novel form, which permitted readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, ensured the Gothic genre's enduring appeal and its ability to feel both obsolete and fresh to readers removed from its original context.\n\nA notable theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, recasts the medieval ideal of knightly training, embodying both the retention and transformation of this tradition. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—a stark contrast to the perceived moral decay of contemporary society. By adopting chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism and serving as a means to critique the present. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil and possibly harboring frustrations with his contemporaries, may have felt that the moral integrity and inherent goodness of the medieval era had been lost in the 'present' society. This sentiment is evident in his portrayal of various characters, notably Frederic, who encapsulates numerous chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, the reader is made aware of his chivalric qualities; he is described as:\n\nThe description of him is replete with chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, having endured tragedy and been presumed killed by infidels. The figure of the 'brave, courteous knight' is exaggerated, exemplifying the soon-to-be iconic Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The shipment of products, from inception to delivery, constitutes the flow of a supply chain. This concept was introduced in 1982 by a certain consultant named Keith Oliver. He posited that supply chain management encompasses the planning, execution, and oversight of this process to meet customer needs swiftly and effectively. Six fundamental components comprise a supply chain: production, sourcing, stockpiling, placement, transit, and information. Business leaders leverage these elements to offer optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the first phase, serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain. It dictates the timing, rationale, site, and method of production. To understand customer preferences, managers scrutinize market trends. This analysis enables them to determine which products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers select the most suitable location for production, considering volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Post-location selection, managers allocate workloads and maintain equipment. Production is pivotal, with meticulous planning crucial to avoid time and cost discrepancies in the long term. My previous experience at Wal-Mart and Target underscores the importance of structured processes. Detailed layouts and procedures, from employee attire to shipment receipts, foster seamless operations and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key component of supply chain management is sourcing. It involves strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and forge partnerships with external entities. A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, personnel, and specialties. Managers must identify the most suitable division for each production segment. They may also opt to outsource work to external companies to accelerate delivery times, maintain quality, and reduce costs.",
            "Standing on a bustling street corner, Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, holds a makeshift sign with a peculiar message. The sign reads, \"Adolf Hitler, alive and well in Myanmar.\" This Southeast Asian country, once known as Burma, has long been governed by a brutal military regime that seized power in 1962. In 2007, monks led a wave of street protests, earning the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government permitted peaceful gatherings, but as protests grew, so did the violence, with the military targeting monasteries. Journalists were imprisoned or killed, including Kenji Nagai, who was murdered on September 27, 2007, for merely covering the demonstrations. Officially, 13 people were killed, but defecting Colonel Hla Win claimed thousands more died. This is not an isolated event. Throughout history, leaders have suppressed dissent to maintain their grip on power. From ancient Roman emperors to modern-day heads of state, the pattern is distressingly familiar.\n\nNotable incidents include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where hundreds to thousands were killed, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, aided by the government, murdered Tutsis and political moderates regardless of ethnicity. Adolf Hitler's campaign of genocide against Jews during World War II stands as a stark reminder of the horrors that can occur when such ideologies are unchecked.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music is attributable to his extensive career and skill in steering his orchestra. While Ellington's keyboard prowess is often understated in many of the compositions analyzed, his forte as a composer shines in his ability to write intricate and multifaceted pieces that highlight individual band member's skills. He crafted a structure that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged pieces that emphasized specific member's styles to convey musical themes. This approach, which also emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, resulted in many groundbreaking and brilliant jazz works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative sound and use of voice as an instrument, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each showcasing unique solo performances and call-and-response patterns between the voice and reeds, brass, and piano. Ellington's mastery of each player's sound, both individually and as a collective, is evident throughout his career.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington's orchestration and tone color skills are on full display. A call-and-response between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing integrates vocal elements with instrumental aspects to create a rich, complementary sound. This technique is further evident in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, showcasing his ear for tone and his ability to complement his soloists.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add depth and color to his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his work. His ability to blend vocal and instrumental elements, highlighting individual player's styles and the ensemble's tone, is a hallmark of his innovative approach to creating jazz music.",
            "Since her early teens, an indescribable yearning had plagued her. It was a longing that remained unquenched, even as years passed. At 14, she began to yearn for something, but three years later, at 17, she realized it wasn't an object but a person that she craved. Yet, none of the boys who showed interest in her managed to pique her curiosity. She often pondered this peculiar condition, trying to rationalize it, but all she had were theories that left her unsatisfied. So, she continued to live her life, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nOn this particular day, a peaceful home was disrupted. Her parents, generally serene, rarely argued with her, except when she sought to assert her independence. They were a calm couple, and their vivacious daughter was a stark contrast, making her both charming and good-natured.\n\nToday, however, tranquility was shattered. She heard a sharp cry from the kitchen, her mother's voice echoing with distress. She rushed in, her heart pounding, and found her mother on the floor, groaning. \"Mom! What happened?\" she exclaimed, kneeling beside her. Her mother, through gritted teeth, instructed her to take her to the hospital. She complied, using her strength from her fitness classes to carry her mother to the car.\n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital filled her nostrils as she rushed her mother in, her mind focused solely on helping her. A team of doctors swiftly attended to her, leaving her to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had been trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet when she fell off a stool, sustaining an injury.",
            "The investigation aimed to demonstrate that compliance with a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternative Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a diminished likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke incidence, including stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, along with reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permissible.\n\nEarlier research has established an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, while an intervention trial indicated that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and decreasing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. Prior studies, however, did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes, and participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, an aMed diet score was calculated from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital, autopsy, or death records. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variability for individuals and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal events.\n\nIncreased adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 incident stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annum of 2007, the United States found itself in the throes of a catastrophic financial calamity. Unemployment surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous prominent American corporations were left in financial oblivion. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting the query: whence did this crisis originate, and how may we forestall such occurrences in the future? Simply put, the financial crisis was unleashed by a combination of self-serving and naive political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into issuing subprime loans upon an already fragile and insufficient financial framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to guarantee and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and managed to pass this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately spreading the contagion throughout the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this financial crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton presidency, as the administration sought to secure a second term by bolstering its popularity. To achieve this, lending restrictions were relaxed, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times, in 1999, reported, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income individuals, and felt the pressure of shareholders to maintain its extraordinary profit growth.”\n\nHolmes accurately prophesied the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, necessitating a government bailout akin to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As expounded in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, imprudent lending would indeed precipitate an economic meltdown.\n\nNumerous factors conspired to plunge the economy into disarray, one of which was the evolving nature of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively employed in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets to become excessively leveraged in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities found themselves in dire straits. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which constituted approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a steep discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to convert into commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",

It's that little voice in your head urging you to get the background out of the way to get to the good stuff, not to be confused with the other voice whispering that you should share every last detail of your characters' backstories.\n\nExposition is the act of relaying information to the audience, typically in straightforward prose. In movies, it's that scene where a character dumps a massive amount of information on another character, like a monologue from the \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nConsider this: As you're reading a tale, you're told about a heroine's love story. She met her beloved at a certain place and time, theymarried in a grand ceremony, and her husband was murdered right in front of her. You wouldn't expect this sequence to take up two whole pages, with both characters only uttering a couple of lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing his love for the heroine through words and actions, and she, in turn, would demonstrate how his presence transformed her life in big and small ways. A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you feel his loss deeply and give you insight into the heroine's thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes. You'd mourn his death with her, and thus become more invested in her story.\n\nIn other words, you'd expect substance, not just a bare-bones narrative: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance. Sometimes, it's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he used to be in the military, now works at a gas station, has been married twice, no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, and secretly dreams of owning the gas station sometime. You'd want to show these details, not just state them.",
            "In two broadcast updates from Columbus, Ohio, an NBC 4 morning segment (August 13, 2011) led with a developing incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was arrested for stabbing his spouse; his mug shot was aired, depicting a menacing demeanor. The piece ran briefly, about two minutes, given the fluid nature of the situation.\n\nA separate morning update highlighted a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, involving a young man named Travis Buyers, who was critically injured. Authorities were investigating; no arrests had been made. This story was concise, a pattern I've noticed with minority victims, often receiving less attention than their white counterparts. This lack of coverage is a consistent issue.\n\nThe broadcast also touched on a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nAn upcoming weather forecast for the weekend was brief, mentioning afternoon thunderstorms and highs in the mid-to-low eighties. This segment was short, perhaps to pique interest for future updates.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF store featured a black man, who was dark-skinned and approximately six feet tall, weighing about 150 pounds. The report seemed to emphasize his race, which I found unnecessary.\n\nAn additional story detailed Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic former drug kingpin convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. While he was sentenced to 300 months, the report noted his ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant.",
            "The connection between siblings is profound, a tether that neither time nor distance can sever. Among its many facets are sentiments like affection, admiration, envy, and spite. Siblings understand each other in ways that others never could, seeing in their brother's eyes a reflection of their own soul. These emotions are most vividly displayed in times of crisis, whether good or ill. When these feelings are laid bare, they come with a price. Part of comprehending the emotional ties of this familial bond is grappling with their repercussions. When one gazes into their brother's eyes, they see not the world's perception of them, but their true self. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions reveal their genuine character. In the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. In a setting rich with vivid description, these two boys embark on an ill-fated journey. Disappointment and pride clash in the story's climax, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the protagonist's direct portrayal and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the protagonist's intricate feelings and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are fueled by a singular emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. He envisioned a brother with whom he could share his skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He dreamed of a brother to race to Horsehead Landing with and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, these aspirations were dashed by Doodle's frail heart. The young protagonist was filled with wild fantasies, only to have them shattered in a moment. He even contemplated harming the small child, considering suffocating him with a pillow. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle merely smiled at him. This display of love was a testament to the protagonist's true feelings, despite his initial thoughts of infanticide. Deep down, he cared for his brother.",
            "The neural matrix, a complex, imaginative data-processing system, has seen its descriptive analogies evolve with technological progress. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll, followed by a tome, and lately, to a digital device, these metaphors, while useful, have limitations and can mislead. As your exploration of the brain unfolds, remember the restricted utility of these analogies and their potential pitfalls.\nSensory organs convert physical stimuli, like touch, warmth, sound waves, or light particles, into electrochemical signals, initiating information intake. The brain then continuously converts this data, employing both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details such as color, orientation, and border positions to infer a box. Top-down processing, leveraging earlier decisions from the bottom-up process, accelerates the recognition of the object as a black box versus a box-like void in the white backdrop.\nAn attentional gate subsequently determines the significance of the signal and the cognitive processes it should engage. In a grass-filled field, your brain processes every blade, yet an efficient attentional gate prevents individual perception unless the signal is deemed noteworthy, like your name in a noisy environment. This process occurs in multiple stages, with the results continuously shaped by attention.\nInformation processing necessitates storage. Various memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies based on the type of stimulus. Verbal input, for instance, can be structured, referring to visual form, phonemic, relating to sound, or semantic, signifying meaning. Once stored, information must be sustained. Working memory, lasting around 20 seconds, is thought to be maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained structurally via certain proteins.\nMultiple theories describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from subjects' memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network theory posits nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relevance. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes aim at the looming perils of technology and capitalism in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this society, collective welfare trumps individuality, and citizens are indoctrinated from birth to prioritize immediate contentment. The populace serves as mere cogs in a larger machine, bound by the World Controller's dictates. Through the lens of Marxist ideology, one discerns Huxley's reservations concerning the burgeoning economic systems of his time. Concepts like homogeneity and reification are evident in his critique, implying that the novel is a commentary on the shortcomings of the emerging capitalist economy.\n\n Capitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are kept in the dark about their true economic ties to other classes, fixated instead on personal gain. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, a tactic employed in Brave New World. The populace, divided into classes such as Delta and Gamma, have no genuine agency, their desires for consumption and indulgence amplified through hypnopædia. This manipulation is evident in the World Controller's influence. The idea of hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a separate group, is clearly present. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, 'buying into' the ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, though capable of understanding, often accept their status. Characters like Bernard exemplify this, with few Alphas and Betas doing more than contentedly accepting their role. The interactions between social classes underscore the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThe novel presents a world where meaningful relationships are absent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley implies that the confluence of technology and capitalism stifles free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by superficial interactions. Men comment on women primarily in terms of their physical attributes, while women discuss their encounters flippantly. Each class' willingness to accept their place in the hierarchy mirrors the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience suggests a proletariat mindset, content with their superior status so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, or roughly four and a half semesters. Like many, navigating campus can be challenging. My freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm room, located quite far eastward, save for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to distant locations like the Willard Building, near the campus core, could take up to 25 minutes, particularly on inclement days, which are frequent in State College. An alumni, only slightly older than me, shared that East Halls was once isolated by expansive, unused land. Now, that empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings including the Creamery and Health Services, and surrounding apartment complexes. As campus growth continues, travel between points becomes increasingly cumbersome. A feasible solution? Bicycles! However, merely having bikes won't suffice. Students must use them, and campuses must accommodate them.\n\nMy friend recently resumed cycling after a break and commented, \"Bikes are fantastic – they're the best way to commute. For a while, it wasn't popular to ride, but it's the most efficient mode of transportation.\" Bicycling is not only beneficial for health but also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can cover 30 miles or more. I now live off-campus, as distant from the center as some dorms. The wisest decision this year was investing in a bike. My classes in Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk from home, can take just 5 minutes by bike, if pedaled quickly. The main issue is Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, which isn't always easy to traverse. Walking is a valid option, but my schedule's too busy for that. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable transport. Walking to Thomas daily would add 30-40 minutes to my day, roughly 2.5 hours weekly, plus extra time for other classes, appointments, etc."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my academic journey towards a degree in social work, my sights are set on a future with the Division of Family and Children Services. Here, I am determined to lend a helping hand to children affected by abuse or neglect, and to support vulnerable families in distress. The values I aim to bring to this field are service, respect, integrity, a commitment to fostering healthier relationships, and a resolve to continually enhance my professional skills. These core principles are not just integral to social work, but are deeply ingrained within me personally.\n\nMy initial fascination with helping others was sparked in high school and college, witnessing individuals retreat from their challenges in denial or employing unhealthy coping strategies. Unsure of my professional direction, I pursued a Bachelor’s in Psychology. Post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a year off to explore my options. During this time, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police. Impelled by a desire to assist, I drove to his parents’ house. After speaking with the police, I intervened with the parents, who seemed defensive and attributed their son’s distress to his “manipulative” behavior. This encounter ignited a resolve within me to pursue social work and support children navigating family conflicts.\n\nThe principle of social justice is a pillar that resonates strongly in the field of social work. Our society lauds the individual, yet often, our societal norms propagate conformity rather than uniqueness. If we genuinely mourn those who perish, why do we strive to emulate the masses? I stand for individuality and have consistently challenged social injustices throughout my academic years. My actions include unconventional hair colors, personalized clothing choices, and piercing beyond the norm, as well as advocating for equality within the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and opposing racism and discrimination. I am committed to championing social justice and will continue to voice my opposition against injustices.",
            "The following investigation delves into the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives concerning the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model centers on inherited genetic information and health-related facets. Conversely, the Sociocultural models examine environmental factors and their impact on demographics such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia explores these models, presenting specific research to elucidate them. The research findings are subsequently evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, secondary sleep disorders, and those due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, whereas secondary sleep disorders are linked to mental disorders or other medical complications. Dyssomnias encompass a range of sleep issues like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, while Parasomnias involve behavioral and physiological disturbances during sleep. The review focuses primarily on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with a broader look at their relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic and physiological aspects. Orexin neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study utilizing mice demonstrated that the GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and sleep. Administration of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that human models can be extrapolated from these findings. This implies that genetic and environmental factors influence the physical GABAB receptor in humans, potentially disrupting sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could naturally regulate sleep, impacting daily tasks and focus.",
            "This composition delves into three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a succinct definition of the disorder is presented. Secondly, the diagnostic process is elucidated, including notable symptoms, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with strategies that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom setting can employ to assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), \"refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and generates electrophysiologic auditory potentials\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning individuals with CAPD may not properly interpret what they hear, despite normal hearing ability. Their brains do not effectively translate sounds into comprehensible information, such as separating words or discerning conversation from background noise.\n\n\tThe earliest reference to the disorder that evolved into CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, known as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers examined children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 sparked increased research on children with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD presents in various forms: individuals may struggle to locate or discern sounds in space, discriminate between multiple acoustic events, recognize sound patterns, identify changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm), be obstructed when one sound is followed by another, have difficulty synthesizing sound clues, or determine the sequence of auditory information presented (Ferre).\n\n\tTo diagnose CAPD, a patient must undergo a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, which may be administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others using various measures that assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This could include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, responses to specific stimuli, or more advanced tests recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses. There is no singular diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder at present.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while impersonation can indeed aid in sustaining prolonged deceptions, it ultimately necessitates the disavowal of one's assumed persona, lest one becomes irrevocably entangled within it. Yet, terminating a deception presents its own set of predicaments, as one might find themselves estranged from those around them. The quandary then lies in choosing between the preservation of one's true self and the sustenance of relationships with others. While some may react indifferently to the revelation of deception, others may feel betrayed and offended by the ruse.\n\nThe theme of gender disguise poses a particular challenge, raising questions like why one might feel compelled to assume the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola's case, it is clear that her transformation is a strategy for self-preservation: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249) Arriving in a foreign land, Viola adopts a male persona to safeguard herself from potential harm. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from female company, depriving her of vital support. Moreover, Viola's successful impersonation leads Olivia to confuse her with Sebastian and fall in love: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) Additionally, she must manage her suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nDespite this, \"Twelfth Night\" might be interpreted as demonstrating how deception can catalyze the expression of suppressed emotions, particularly in the instances of Olivia and Orsino. Some passages hint that these characters may harbor unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario due to his apparent maleness, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It is doubtful that Olivia's affections are truly romantic, as Shakespeare's character often satirizes those who judge others solely based on appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The harsh realities of German colonial rule, particularly the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa, have been widely documented. However, a comprehensive understanding of the empire's educational landscape cannot be reduced to such a simplistic portrayal. The German colonial empire was characterized by a great disparity in policies and governance across its various territories, as well as in the educational provisions it offered. While the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919 revealed a significant populace of educated and literate Africans, Germany's educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were also acknowledged by contemporary observers. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively promoted state-run schools and played a pivotal role in the education of indigenous populations, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government backing. Meanwhile, the government allocated substantial resources to European education, establishing a robust system of state schools and actively supporting and overseeing missionary institutions. These educational policies had enduring ramifications for South West Africa, even after the departure of German rule. Despite the presence of literate and educated Africans in other German colonies, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the populace remained uneducated and illiterate.\" A range of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors in depth, with a focus on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous population.\nResearch on education within the German colonial empire is extensive, with many sources originating from the early twentieth century and written in German. These early works primarily sought to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language studies expanded this discourse through comparative analyses and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's work, which compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, is particularly notable. Cohen attributes many of South West Africa's distinctive educational features to its substantial settler population.\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa enjoyed a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This made the colony more hospitable to European settlers. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, whereas only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the last century to encompass an extensive array of genres. The sheer number of these genres has made it challenging to enumerate them all collectively, as many—from rap to rock, country to jazz, and folk—have birthed multiple subgenres and subsubgenres. Notably, the subgenre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive genres within the realm of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressive nature is evident through its wide-ranging emotional spectrum, though it often veers toward the darker nuances. The genre's flexibility has fostered the creation of numerous subgenres and subsubgenres, with this chain of diversification continuing to this day. Today, the heavy metal scene has fragmented into so many niches that defining the core essence of heavy metal has become an arduous task. It has infiltrated themes from various other genres, yet it finds its roots in a specific source. To comprehend the sprawling landscape of metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and its status as a movement, rather than merely a genre.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. It is distinguished by a departure from primitivism and an emphasis on technical proficiency, with musicians showcasing their skills through their instruments. Moreover, metal is inherently tied to the influence of substance use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom catalyzed a surge in experimental, otherworldly recordings, with drugs serving as a conduit for musical exploration. This genre possesses raw, visceral qualities, which was a novel departure from the mainstream music's emotional palette. Furthermore, subsequent generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from the song \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify the darker themes that are integral to the movement. This song, considered by some as one of the pioneers of Heavy Metal, was a response to a Rolling Stones track that leaned heavier and darker, with The Beatles aiming to prove their ability to match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Decades prior to the Surrealists' inception of their dreamlike art, an artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. The Dream, Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, is not merely a depiction of a woman captivated by her dream landscape; it also encapsulates his personal aspirations and internal conflict. Throughout his career, he yearned for acceptance, respect, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, yet faced a troublesome dilemma: should he conform to or mimic established painting styles to gain recognition, or should he maintain his unique creative independence? To fully appreciate The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's biographical narrative. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau hails from humble beginnings. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity. Lacking formal artistic training, Rousseau worked as a municipal toll service employee until the age of forty, earning the nickname \"douanier.\" After his first wife's death and the tragic loss of eight infant children, leaving him with just one daughter, Julia, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike his contemporaries, who often glorified peasant life in their art, Rousseau was a self-taught folk artist, embodying the hopes and dreams of his working-class peers.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance in the art world is not merely understandable but also plausible, given his circumstances. He lacked formal training, started his artistic journey later in life, and coexisted with better-known contemporaries. The book Modern French Painters by Jan Gordon clarifies the distinction between Rousseau and contemporaries such as Matisse: \"Matisse was driven by a fear of clichéd painting, whereas Rousseau's aim was to create a conventional work that would secure his admission to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous philosophers have suggested a profound intertwining of ethics and aesthetics, of truth and beauty. I hold that at the core of this lies a reason, one which John Keats articulated in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of life's knowledge comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to value ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction. Both are attempts to describe rather than prescribe, seeking explanations for beauty or morality rather than rules for judgment. Art and moral criticism often fall short in capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discussion of the Mona Lisa's worth might delve into technical details, but these don't capture why it's great art. We frequently use phrases like \"There's just something about it\" to describe our favorites. Both art and morality resist complete description. Flannery O'Connor and Wittgenstein echo this, emphasizing the ineffable nature of both. This \"je ne sais quoi\" in art and morality is their most potent trait, linking them. As McKean suggests, literature's moral quality is unique, as it uniquely engages our values and life itself. This noumenal impact, where we experience but can't fully explain, strengthens this link.",
            "Present-day Germany is regarded as a formidable entity, a cohesive nation that is home to diverse cultural elements, from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This unique cultural tapestry can be felt in cities like Cologne on the Rhine, spanning the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given this rich cultural heritage, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a fusion of various influences and tribes.\n\nThe nomenclature \"Germania\" is shrouded in historical debate. Some scholars attribute the name to a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to engage in conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98 AD). Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, utilized the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and those he hadn't, borrowing it from the Gauls themselves (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the term may derive from the Germanic word for spear, \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish term \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud or noisy nature (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous and unmixed by other races. He pondered, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its harsh landscape, inclement skies, and sullen demeanor, unless it were their native land?\" (Tacitus, 98 AD). Meanwhile, the Romans, with their extensive empire, typically sent their conquests into Germania for trade and occasionally led land campaigns before returning home (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).\n\nAs Germanic tribes began surfacing in the first century, they lived on the outskirts of the Roman Empire, trading their land-derived goods and military skills within the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "Gazing downwards, I observed the scene before me, my mind blank and unfeeling.  I was an impartial spectator, studying the image without attaching any personal interpretation or emotion.  Thoughts came and went, as if on a conveyor belt, I merely witnessed them.  I felt no sense of ownership over my thoughts, just a fluid awareness of the visual data presented.  I had, once upon a time, been advised by an artistic colleague to purchase a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  My enthusiasm for drawing had begun at age six, and this book delved into the fundamentals, from the nature of pencils to the brain's interpretative processes.  One method it taught was to visualize a square frame around any subject, transforming complex scenes into manageable units.  Standing before the bowl, I was awestruck, unable to impose this technique.  The room was filled with the grandeur of art history, from Picasso's blue phase to Monet's greenery, and I felt a sense of inadequacy, but also a spark of inspiration.  I picked up my tool, muscles tensing and relaxing, my thoughts shaping the action.  The toilet, however, was less cooperative, the offending brown mass defying my attempts to dislodge it.  After a few futile attempts, I resorted to wrapping the toilet paper around my hand like an oven mitt, then slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, reminiscent of a mother preparing a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The youth of America face a significant threat on our highways—teen drivers, numerous fatalities. This state of affairs is a convergence of several factors. The National Institutes of Health provide that a key challenge is the developing teenage brain, not yet equipped to navigate driving's perils. Inexperience is another culprit, leading to more fatal crashes, frequent rollovers, excessive speeding, and road departures. Peer influence exacerbates the problem, as teens often drive with their friends, a practice any sensible person would acknowledge.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses restricting teen driving hours and barring minor passengers. However, these are mere band-aids, the core issue being that collectively, young drivers lack the skill set to manage driving's hazards. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman contends that even 18 is too young for unrestricted driving. He has found that teens under 19-20 crave thrills, increasing risk-taking.\n\nThus, delaying driving until this tendency subsides would be prudent. Failure to do so may lead to escalating fatalities. By 2010, the Baby Boomer children will be eligible, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nA feasible legislative solution could involve continuing driver education in schools but barring teens under 18 from driving. Provisional permits could be issued, with the same practical training hours as most states. Uniform national legislation would be logical and effective in safeguarding teens nationwide.\n\nThe proposed legislation isn't uncharted territory.",
            "Upon sifting through the Library of Congress's archives, I encountered a collection of early Edison films, specifically fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films are notable for their clever editing techniques, which create illusions. My analysis, primarily, was centered around elucidating the poetic elements of the majority of these trick films and scrutinizing the outliers in the latter films. Generally, the trick films of the turn of the century were confined within the boundaries of a stage, employing a frontal proscenium, static camera positioning, and a strict adherence to long and medium shots, with each shot comprising a complete film. Yet, some films at the dawn of the twentieth century did diverge from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prevailing similarity amongst these trick films is their filming within a stationary interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed, never moving to follow figures or objects. This compositional choice was deeply rooted in the theatre and vaudeville traditions, particularly for trick films. However, this static stage setup constrains movement to horizontal, with figures moving side-to-side without approaching or receding from the camera. Consider the sequence in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, yet the camera does not track them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium format also dictates shot lengths, with long shots being the norm and medium shots less frequent. Close-ups are entirely absent. This adherence to theatrical and vaudevillian traditions, where the audience views the entire performance at once, framed by the stage, eliminates close-ups, with actors not moving towards the camera. The format of one conceptual shot per film limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on frames per second. This also restricts their narrative or dramatic potential, with most focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks, like magic, disappearing acts, or switches, with minimal story. Notably, in a trick film, a conceptual shot in the viewer's perception is not equivalent to a physical shot. A single \"shot\" may comprise multiple physically distinct shots joined to create an illusion, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A closer examination reveals the precise moment when the physical shot of Mary's \"severed head\" begins, despite the film appearing as a single unified shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and passionate advocate for the Republican cause. His background in agriculture and a brief political career instilled in him a tenacious commitment to individual liberties and governance. His agricultural pursuits and political experiences shaped his views on government, with his promotion of an agrarian system as the cornerstone of his beliefs on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor envisioned a unique opportunity for the United States to establish an ideal governance system, free from native traditions that could hinder its creation. He firmly believed in the inherent interdependence of natural rights, asserting that denying one right diminishes the value of all. Consequently, he argued that these rights should be shielded from government interference.\n\nIn his quest for an ideal society, Taylor held that a government must acknowledge the good and evil within humanity. He adhered to a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and subdue capitalism, and believed that a government founded on such principles would function equitably despite its administrators' potential self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimalist Federal government, restricting its powers to those explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could become oppressive due to its cost. However, he cautioned that a purely literal interpretation could lead to corruption, necessitating consideration of the writers' intent. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly describes the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "Upon reviewing Figure 17, it was observed that commuter log submissions plummeted in the third month of the project. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reason behind it was not readily apparent. Considering that this period coincides with the onset of winter in a New England locale, it's plausible that the dip in bicycle and pedestrian commuting played a role. Additionally, December marks the end of the academic semester, leaving many preoccupied with final tasks and grading, which could have led to the log submisions being overlooked. Furthermore, December is a holiday month, with a subsequent break for both students and faculty, reducing campus attendance significantly. The resumption of classes in late January might also explain the low number of February submissions. However, the dip in February remains unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for such projects often wanes over time. To address this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did manage to boost log submissions. Thus, one challenge was sustaining project momentum amidst natural ebbs and academic breaks.\n\nAnother significant hurdle for this project, and similar initiatives, is the widespread preference for driving. This behavior is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it's crucial to offer incentives to encourage alternative modes of commuting. We offered various prizes, including gift cards for local businesses and even a few national chains. It's intriguing to consider whether even larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have further increased participation. The value of these prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing their value over time could have potentially boosted engagement.

            "An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a financial product that mirrors an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to an index fund, yet offers more flexibility as it trades like a stock on an exchange. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs provide the benefits of diversification and ownership akin to single stocks, including short selling, margin buying, and purchasing as little as one share per transaction. Despite these advantages, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. However, there are trade-offs; every ETF transaction incurs a commission, similar to stock trades. Another plus side is the broad range of available funds. It is prudent for discerning investors to scrutinize these claimed benefits, ensuring they exist and are substantial. For this study, we examine ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, accounting for 63.58% of its assets, to assess whether owning a single ETF yields benefits similar to a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks. We also explore if there's a more optimal stock configuration offering a better Sharpe ratio or return.",
            "A notable work in Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre is \"Dream-Land,\" which he esteemed amongst his finest creations. In this piece, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. Virgil, in turn, employed this term to denote an island beyond the northern reaches of Britain, an extremity of the known world to the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, a more contemporary influence could be acknowledged. Poe, fascinated by German literature, would have encountered this term through his readings of Goethe.\n\nThis is of significance as it illuminates Poe's intimacy with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his tome \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallel lines between the two poets' compositions, suggesting Poe's imitation of Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature lauds Goethe as a luminary of poetic drama, particularly for his magnum opus \"Faust,\" released in two installments, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the latter part of Faust, a short poem entitled \"The King of Thule\" appears, depicting a monarch whose life unravels after the death of his wife and the gifting of a goblet. Driven to despair, he ultimately sacrifices himself and his possessions, save for the goblet, which he casts into the sea. This narrative bears a striking resemblance to the emotional landscape of \"Dream-Land,\" with its melancholic speaker haunted and desolate, echoing Poe's grief and possibly his own struggles with alcohol.\n\nPoe's invocation of Thule is not isolated to \"Dream-Land\"; he employs the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" The use of the term as bookends in \"Dream-Land\" further underscores its significance. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with the latter's dark, lonely Thule mirroring Goethe's desolate king and his own poignant loss. The speaker's description of this realm as a haunted, colorless, and shaded world resonates with the despair of Goethe's king, as if Poe had stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe's importance cannot be overstated; Poe would have been familiar with his works, at the very least through Tennyson's admiration for him. When queried about his esteem for Tennyson, Poe also expressed his respect for Goethe, likely having encountered his works through various reproductions.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a customer injured following a slip-and-fall on a spilled applesauce in a supermarket be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with ill intent because he was informed of the spill twice and did not clear it for half an hour due to dining?A judge is unlikely to promptly dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To establish that punitive damages are merited, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with willful and deliberate disregard for probable harm, as well as evidence that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple incidents of slipping had occurred prior to her accident, and despite this knowledge, he failed to address the issue. While Palmer's assertion that Martin's actions were reprehensible is less convincing, it remains reasonable under the circumstances, considering six slip-and-fall incidents had transpired in 2009 and Martin still failed to implement adequate measures to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, Richard Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, notified his supervisor, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and \"didn't have time to handle customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Mr. Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. By 5:30 PM on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a severe back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five separate slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial dismissal of the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" id. at § (c)(1). Courts have labeled conduct as malicious when, knowing the probable harmful consequences, a defendant deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Nearly four years ago, I encountered a course on Islam at CBC, where the class frequently debated the contentious issue of whether Islam is inherently hostile. The relevance of this discussion appears to have grown since then, particularly in light of recent global events and the shifting public perception of Islam in the United States. In the aftermath of 9/11, for instance, there's been a noticeable shift from a hostile portrayal of Islam and extremism to an extreme form of tolerance, even to the extent that a candidate with a Muslim background, such as President Barack Obama, could be elected in 2008.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad captures my curiosity as the narrative diverges from historical accounts of his life. In my previous understanding, Muhammad was perceived as a conqueror who compelled tribes to adopt Islam through force. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr who endured misunderstanding and humility. This version of events implies that people increasingly sought out Muhammad after witnessing his teachings' truth.\n\nCertain parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad also intrigue me. For example, the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men echoes the biblical story of Jesus' feeding of the five thousand. This style of storytelling suggests a deliberate attempt to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, emphasizing his acts of truth and miracle, rather than necessitating proofs. This approach, I believe, diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and miracles.\n\nMoreover, many stories in the biography seem to serve an agenda of demonstrating the voluntary nature of conversions to Islam. These accounts often rely on third-party accounts, with information passed down through multiple intermediaries. While intended to bolster the credibility of the stories, this method can actually undermine their authenticity, as it adds layers of hearsay.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a pious, wise, and gentle leader. Historical records contradict this depiction, suggesting a more complex and sometimes harsh figure. Given this disparity, it makes me wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the full spectrum of Muhammad's history and rise to power.",
            "The precepts and convictions espoused by Jesus during his tenure were promptly cast aside as Christian thought evolved post-mortem. A cursory examination of this trajectory reveals a steady drift away from the origin. The contemporary world exhibits an increasing consciousness and an unparalleled progressive inclination. While the traditionalists persist, their influence may not be extensive enough to dictate the whole. Among the adherents, historical acumen will surge in the coming years, sparking a desire to discern the principles appended to Christianity over time from the authentic intentions of its namesake. This pendulum swing may take decades or even centuries, but the reversal is assured: Christianity will revert to its primordial form. A swell will emerge, peeling back the layers of doctrine, much like the hands of a clock turning backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this wave sweeps across the United States and Europe, swaying the masses to revere as if we were living in Jesus' time, following solely his thoughts, the institutional church will remain steadfast in guiding the way. However, with the theological clock reversed, the proliferation of diversity within Christendom will diminish, giving way to uniformity of belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and sectarian differences will yield to growing similarities. History is replete with such reversals. Case in point: Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, yet the empire later became a Christian power. Our nation has evolved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversal in Christianity will unfold, undoing history to return to the source and diminishing diversity in its path. This progression hinges on an interpretative approach to Jesus' words, viewing them as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what has transpired since Jesus' life?\n       A deep dive into history reveals that Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity, was predominant. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were the bedrock of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish populace was not unified; they were divided into groups such as Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "The narrative of \"The Jungle\" reveals the inherent inclination of humans to prioritize self-interest and disregard the well-being of others. In Sinclair's world, the executives and overseers of the sprawling factories represent this self-serving nature. They are solely focused on amassing power and wealth, oblivious to the havoc their actions wreak. The author employs vivid imagery to highlight the consequences of their unchecked ambition, \"The buildings stood tall and proud against the sky, their smokestacks spewing clouds of smoke that stretched towards infinity.\" This visual is a stark depiction of the environmental devastation caused by their relentless pursuit of progress.\n\nThe indifference extends to the employees, who are mere tools in their pursuit of profit. Workers are subject to grueling schedules and sudden layoffs without recompense, all in the name of maximizing efficiency. In the absence of protective regulations, exploitation was rife. The employers held a stranglehold over their workforce, much like slave owners, with workers having no recourse or support. The narrative hints at the dehumanizing conditions, \"The workers, many of whom were immigrants, lived in a perpetual state of poverty and desperation, their lives contingent on the caprices of their masters.\" Unions, intended to advocate for the workers, often exacerbated the suffering, further entrenching the system of exploitation that defined Packingtown.",
            "Multiple authors deploy varied methods to evoke specific sentiments in their audiences. Among these techniques, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to impart a certain vibe around a subject. He also ascribes significance to symbols and uses them to achieve the same effect. In his work, Fitzgerald assigns meaning to numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. He builds up these meanings and subsequently employs them to trigger certain emotions when encountering significant objects.\n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, with white connoting elegance and sophistication, and gray symbolizing age and weariness. He establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white,\" and even Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party. Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. The only departure from this white prevalence occurs when Nick is first introduced to Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors.\" This color coding extends to various mundane subjects, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, and even the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. Fitzgerald further reinforces this uniformity by describing common people or places in these colors, including the \"white girlhood\" of Jordan and Daisy, and the \"gray\" Italian child on the railroad.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he uses white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy, who, after a prolonged absence of either color in the story, is described as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" Readers begin to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform addition, a mere object of Gatsby's desire. This use of color continues with references to a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her being in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County, due to its temperate and sunny climate, is a notable agricultural powerhouse. Crops that flourish here include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the region, with several local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms not only offer tours of their operations but also facilitate activities like hiking and birdwatching. Such enterprises can leverage government programs to enhance habitat quality, create recreational spaces, and generate income or educational opportunities. Organic farming, while more demanding in terms of labor and management, can foster greater biodiversity. However, it may also incur higher costs and experience greater crop losses. Non-organic practices beneficial to wildlife can also add to labor expenses. Thus, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to balance profits and habitat conservation. The selected land is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, home to over a hundred species, many endangered or declining. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later used by cattle ranchers. The property was originally part of a homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production. Researching available government programs and exploring a nearby organic farm provided insights into potential cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices.",
            "Cultural nuances are pivotal in any negotiation. Culture isn't just about what it is, but also what it isn't and the meaning behind it. It's diverse, multifaceted, and not universally uniform. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad and oversimplified. While understanding cultural norms is beneficial, it's more productive to grasp how a culture's values influence negotiation dynamics. When interacting with foreign cultures, one tends to compare them to their own, which can be insightful but also misleading.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset might involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of attempting to alter or judge a culture, one should accept it as is and operate within its parameters, especially when negotiations are involved, and particularly if one is in a weaker position. Being on \"foreign\" turf necessitates respect for traditions and beliefs, which can transcend cultural hurdles and facilitate negotiations.\n\nCulture isn't confined to national or international contexts. Many companies within a nation develop their own unique corporate culture, evident in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and attitudes towards philanthropy. Even within a single nation, corporate cultures can vary widely, as seen in the differences between American companies. Some cultures appear more uniform, but a closer look reveals their varied nuances.\n\nValues are crucial to decipher, as they explain why a culture behaves a certain way. If preserving face or promoting harmony is valued, a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes aggressive negotiations won't settle quickly. Recognizing these cultural priorities before negotiations is essential, but learning about the other party's personal values can enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "\"In the Book of Psalms, it is written, 'The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is central to St. Anselm's reasoning regarding the existence of a deity, and it is also echoed by Thomas Aquinas. To evaluate their arguments, we'll presume they both adhere to the monotheistic belief of the Bible, as they are both defending the same divine figure. This assumption simplifies our comparison, as both arguments are rooted in the same concept of God.\n\nIn examining Anselm's approach, we find that it centers on an inner search for truth. He posits that God's existence can be derived from our understanding, as we cannot imagine His nonexistence. This concept, though complex and sometimes unclear, suggests that God's reality is intrinsic to our minds. Thus, the proof lies within us, requiring no external verification. This notion aligns with Christian teachings, which often refer to this as faith.\n\nConversely, Aquinas advocates for a rationale based on logical reasoning and empirical evidence. His method avoids faith entirely, making it more appealing for converting non-believers, as it relies on reasoning rather than accepting something unprovable. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument illustrates that God's existence is a necessary logical conclusion. If one lacks a single piece of a puzzle but can deduce its features and existence from the rest, this is analogous to Aquinas' logical arguments for God's existence.",
            "In the dawn of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a monarch-to-be, later revered as the Buddha, drew breath. His life's journey saw him forsake the world and achieve enlightenment, sparking the birth of Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being Theravada Buddhism. The religion, now over two and a half millennia old, bears little resemblance to its founders' time. This can be observed in Theravada-majority Sri Lanka, where the annual Maha Silavimokkha ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople participate, despite no mention of such rituals in the Buddha's teachings. These modifications extend from the most outward traditions to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, spanning both monastic and lay domains, has adapted its principles over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, both friendly and adversarial.\n\tTo navigate this discussion, several key terms will be frequently used. Here, internal forces refer to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation. External forces encompass those from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that pose a threat or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often due to misconceptions about Buddhism. Benign forces, meanwhile, do not wish to harm or aid the community, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will recur throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, let us examine the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism—the doctrines that underpin it. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the religion's metaphysical aspects, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth life's rules. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: I will not kill, I will not lie, I will not steal, I will not misbehave sexually, and I will not consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The most foundational doctrinal tenet is the four noble truths: life is Dukkha (suffering), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once faced a protracted dispute lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145) The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious and gained control of Texas and the southwestern territories. Multiple skirmishes occurred between these nations, tapering off just prior to the First World War. The rivalry stemmed from disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario mirrors many other nations that have ongoing rivalries with their neighbors. Shared borders often lead to conflicting interests, fostering rivalries. The United States and Mexico are no exception. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that “Only in Mexico and Cuba does one find enduring American diplomatic issues” (p. 41). Indeed, both nations, being geographically close to the United States, have historically been rivals, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious tensions have long divided these nations, a problem that has plagued many throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that “While in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similar to the Cold War, the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, this conflict was partly ideological and partly a competition over vital interests. However, the ideological differences were rooted in religious preferences rather than political systems. The distrust stemmed from earlier colonial tensions between the English and Spanish, which hindered the development of peaceful diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States over the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered around territorial issues, with border raids and frontier problems being significant concerns. Outlaw activities from American border towns into Mexican territory posed a major challenge, persisting until both nations strengthened their military presence on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States. It finally concluded with a shift in American ambitions, from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, towards the end of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen and unanticipated affliction rendered me incapacitated, an illness that I had never been made aware of. At that time, I was pursuing a career as a nurse, a choice made due to a profound desire for the safety and stability that I had lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always find employment; people will always require care\" became the mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Thus, even though my heart yearned to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a blend of both, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am: 46 years old, unmarried, possessing no financial reserves, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after 15 years of subsisting on Social Security Disability, I have nothing left that is truly mine. I manage to endure, but every day is a battle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing is certain anymore, yet there is one truth that stands unwavering: I could not have persevered for this long without the support of my kin and a few steadfast friends. And let me assure you, when calamity truly strikes, you feel far from invincible.\n\nThe crux of my argument is that life is full of unpredictability, both large and small. There are no guarantees, and despite our best efforts, some challenges are simply too immense to overcome alone.\n\nI am in complete agreement that we must cease placing all our hopes in the crumbling, leaky vessel that is our government. But I would much prefer to see Americans reclaim their trust in one another, learning to aid each other and to request assistance, rather than each of us retreating to our own backyards to construct fallout shelters.\n\nThe conservatives in the U.S. often extol the virtues of \"rugged individualism\" that supposedly built this nation; however, the resilience of our forefathers in times of hardship was not born of rugged individualism, but of compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who traversed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains did not reach the coast by relying solely on their own strength.\n\nAs such, I wholeheartedly recommend preparing for emergencies. I am well-equipped with a disaster kit, first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for my windows in the event of a biological attack. I possess multiple flashlights and an abundance of batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources to maintain a small farm and preserve your own food, do so. It is a commendable endeavor, as is the installation of a wood stove, provided you do not reside in an apartment.\n\nBut alongside these preparations, it is essential to forge connections with your neighbors.",
            "What drives the evolutionary trajectory of organisms? Are there inherent restrictions or constraints that steer the course of biological change? As D'Arcy Thompson acknowledged in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has barely begun to dream of defining in mathematical terms the simplest organic forms.\" While this sentiment still holds true, advancements in mathematical modeling have been made in understanding mollusk skeletogenesis throughout ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to unravel the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes in Prunum by integrating mathematical modeling with experimental studies. Using X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These models help interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, complementing experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a cylindrical structure that evolves over time through 360 degrees of space, with each loop or turn referred to as a whorl, spiraling around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The rate at which whorls expand varies, with a continuous boundary separating each one, called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl, known as the body whorl, is the last. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and base at the bottom. The aperture, an opening, is where the animal exits the shell.\n\nShells can be examined from various angles: apical (top view), basal (bottom view), apertural (front view), and abapertural (side view). The standard orientation places the aperture toward the viewer with the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and locating the first suture. Draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of apertures tracking the animal's growth over time and space. The path of the aperture can be tracked using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has shown little fluctuation. Despite Indonesia's progress towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements for child and maternal health remain insufficient to meet 2015 targets. Various factors contribute to these shortfalls, suggesting the need to bolster the healthcare system rather than solely focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled personnel, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot administer medical interventions during complex pregnancies, leading to maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, these improvements are somewhat deceptive and further work is needed. Additionally, the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea has declined. Data on postnatal care is incomplete but shows low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarian-section rates remain low, at 4%, with urban areas having a 7% rate compared to 2% in rural areas. This disparity highlights the issue of limited healthcare access, primarily in rural regions. Moreover, there's a 27% gap in service usage between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, indicating the poor struggle more to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nLooking forward to enhancing neonatal and maternal health indicators, the crucial question is how best to tackle the gap in service delivery. Should Indonesia adopt targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall healthcare system without focusing solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches offer clear, manageable objectives and quicker results, they can also lead to funding diversion and duplication of services. For instance, heavy investment in one sector, like HIV/AIDS, can divert resources from another like family planning.",
            "The Victorian period's literature is renowned for its meticulous detail and preoccupation with the upper class. Contrary to this, novels such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge, showcasing elements of intrigue and eccentricity that are atypical of the era. These novels use mystery, often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, to delve deeper into characters' motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his plight, and his inability to control his circumstances. The shooting scene in Chapter 28, a vivid dreamlike sequence, demonstrates Oliver's lack of control and the dire straits of his health. The passage emphasizes his desperation and the relentless fear and pain he experiences during the shooting, even as he is removed from the immediate shock. The incident suggests that Oliver's misfortune is not of his own making, reinforcing his helplessness and growing sense of defeat, as if old Fagin is breaking his spirit and stripping him of the ability to react. The shooting highlights the pervasive influence of his fate, which is not under his control. This is underscored by Oliver's inability to muster any response, even in the face of life-threatening danger. The shooting, in this context, serves as a stark reminder of his powerlessness and the extent to which he is a pawn in the hands of external forces.",
            "A few years back, I participated in an after-school program assisting elementary-aged students with their studies. I offered my best efforts to help them in their areas of need, with a particular aptitude for English and reading. An instructor approached me, requesting my assistance with a young boy named Adrian, presumably in third or fourth grade, who was grappling with reading difficulties. It became evident that something was amiss; his pronunciation of certain letters was flawless, while others were completely off. Intrigued, I discovered that Adrian, of Latino descent, spoke English flawlessly but struggled with the alphabet. This revelation occurred when I encountered Adrian's mother, who only communicated in Spanish. Despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to convey our thoughts. It dawned on me that Adrian could read well but lacked familiarity with the English alphabet. I hope Adrian's reading skills improved since then.\n\nI share this anecdote to highlight the challenges posed by language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also illustrates the complexity of reading difficulties, even for students who speak English fluently. The issue is evident, so what is the solution? In Adrian's case, English reading tutoring, particularly focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is multifaceted and complex. No single approach can solve the problem; the key lies in combining various strategies.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a promising approach. Not only for Spanish-speaking students, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There's a misconception that this system wastes resources and benefits only a select few. This is untrue. If implemented as the norm, all children would reap its benefits. How can we achieve this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Instead, special bilingual aids or tutors could be employed to support this system.",
            "Since childhood, we're often introduced to the notion that there's something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some of us attend religious institutions to learn about it, while others explore within ourselves for answers. Many of us inherit and embrace the faiths passed down by our ancestors, while others reject them entirely. Our paths differ, each one carving out a unique spiritual identity. We all search for guidance in the darkness to guide us into the light.\n\nMy father, when I inquired about his favorite bird, replied \"A cardinal.\" We sat on our porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above, as we shared cigarettes. The gutters emptied the rain, drowning the plants around us. He gazed into the rain, lost in thought, thinner and weaker than I remembered. His hair had thinned, his clothes loose on his frame. He stared ahead, evading my gaze. I felt isolated, anxious, unable to discuss my fears with him. I embraced him, moved my chair closer, and gazed with him into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments prolonged his suffering, but only by a few months. I couldn't watch him depart this life. I wanted to honor his memory as he lived, not as he died. I curled up in bed for three days, awaiting news.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The conventional \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially a synthesis of \"old\" and \"new\" elements, as elucidated by Ian Watt in his seminal work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This literary mode has been simultaneously maligned and celebrated, with critics alternately accusing it of superficiality and lauding its 'terrifying grandeur' (Burke). The inception of the \"Gothic Novel\" can be traced back to The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole, which blended both archaic and contemporary romance tropes to birth the fledgling Gothic genre and introduce a novel method of storytelling. Walpole deftly incorporated old theatrical elements and modern mimetic techniques in his \"Gothic Tale\" (Walpole 4), creating a unique fusion that drew from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Despite the word \"gothic\" being used to denote various peoples, styles, and eras, it was often viewed as antiquated or unsophisticated amidst the literary and societal advancements of the time. The marriage of these 'Gothic' elements with the novel form, which permitted readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, ensured the Gothic genre's enduring appeal and its ability to feel both obsolete and fresh to readers removed from its original context.\n\nA notable theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, recasts the medieval ideal of knightly training, embodying both the retention and transformation of this tradition. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—a stark contrast to the perceived moral decay of contemporary society. By adopting chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism and serving as a means to critique the present. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil and possibly harboring frustrations with his contemporaries, may have felt that the moral integrity and inherent goodness of the medieval era had been lost in the 'present' society. This sentiment is evident in his portrayal of various characters, notably Frederic, who encapsulates numerous chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, the reader is made aware of his chivalric qualities; he is described as:\n\nThe description of him is replete with chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, having endured tragedy and been presumed killed by infidels. The figure of the 'brave, courteous knight' is exaggerated, exemplifying the soon-to-be iconic Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The shipment of products, from inception to delivery, constitutes the flow of a supply chain. This concept was introduced in 1982 by a certain consultant named Keith Oliver. He posited that supply chain management encompasses the planning, execution, and oversight of this process to meet customer needs swiftly and effectively. Six fundamental components comprise a supply chain: production, sourcing, stockpiling, placement, transit, and information. Business leaders leverage these elements to offer optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the first phase, serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain. It dictates the timing, rationale, site, and method of production. To understand customer preferences, managers scrutinize market trends. This analysis enables them to determine which products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers select the most suitable location for production, considering volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Post-location selection, managers allocate workloads and maintain equipment. Production is pivotal, with meticulous planning crucial to avoid time and cost discrepancies in the long term. My previous experience at Wal-Mart and Target underscores the importance of structured processes. Detailed layouts and procedures, from employee attire to shipment receipts, foster seamless operations and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key component of supply chain management is sourcing. It involves strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and forge partnerships with external entities. A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, personnel, and specialties. Managers must identify the most suitable division for each production segment. They may also opt to outsource work to external companies to accelerate delivery times, maintain quality, and reduce costs.",
            "Standing on a bustling street corner, Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, holds a makeshift sign with a peculiar message. The sign reads, \"Adolf Hitler, alive and well in Myanmar.\" This Southeast Asian country, once known as Burma, has long been governed by a brutal military regime that seized power in 1962. In 2007, monks led a wave of street protests, earning the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government permitted peaceful gatherings, but as protests grew, so did the violence, with the military targeting monasteries. Journalists were imprisoned or killed, including Kenji Nagai, who was murdered on September 27, 2007, for merely covering the demonstrations. Officially, 13 people were killed, but defecting Colonel Hla Win claimed thousands more died. This is not an isolated event. Throughout history, leaders have suppressed dissent to maintain their grip on power. From ancient Roman emperors to modern-day heads of state, the pattern is distressingly familiar.\n\nNotable incidents include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where hundreds to thousands were killed, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, aided by the government, murdered Tutsis and political moderates regardless of ethnicity. Adolf Hitler's campaign of genocide against Jews during World War II stands as a stark reminder of the horrors that can occur when such ideologies are unchecked.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music is attributable to his extensive career and skill in steering his orchestra. While Ellington's keyboard prowess is often understated in many of the compositions analyzed, his forte as a composer shines in his ability to write intricate and multifaceted pieces that highlight individual band member's skills. He crafted a structure that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged pieces that emphasized specific member's styles to convey musical themes. This approach, which also emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, resulted in many groundbreaking and brilliant jazz works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative sound and use of voice as an instrument, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each showcasing unique solo performances and call-and-response patterns between the voice and reeds, brass, and piano. Ellington's mastery of each player's sound, both individually and as a collective, is evident throughout his career.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington's orchestration and tone color skills are on full display. A call-and-response between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing integrates vocal elements with instrumental aspects to create a rich, complementary sound. This technique is further evident in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, showcasing his ear for tone and his ability to complement his soloists.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add depth and color to his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his work. His ability to blend vocal and instrumental elements, highlighting individual player's styles and the ensemble's tone, is a hallmark of his innovative approach to creating jazz music.",
            "Since her early teens, an indescribable yearning had plagued her. It was a longing that remained unquenched, even as years passed. At 14, she began to yearn for something, but three years later, at 17, she realized it wasn't an object but a person that she craved. Yet, none of the boys who showed interest in her managed to pique her curiosity. She often pondered this peculiar condition, trying to rationalize it, but all she had were theories that left her unsatisfied. So, she continued to live her life, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nOn this particular day, a peaceful home was disrupted. Her parents, generally serene, rarely argued with her, except when she sought to assert her independence. They were a calm couple, and their vivacious daughter was a stark contrast, making her both charming and good-natured.\n\nToday, however, tranquility was shattered. She heard a sharp cry from the kitchen, her mother's voice echoing with distress. She rushed in, her heart pounding, and found her mother on the floor, groaning. \"Mom! What happened?\" she exclaimed, kneeling beside her. Her mother, through gritted teeth, instructed her to take her to the hospital. She complied, using her strength from her fitness classes to carry her mother to the car.\n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital filled her nostrils as she rushed her mother in, her mind focused solely on helping her. A team of doctors swiftly attended to her, leaving her to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had been trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet when she fell off a stool, sustaining an injury.",
            "The investigation aimed to demonstrate that compliance with a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternative Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a diminished likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke incidence, including stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, along with reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permissible.\n\nEarlier research has established an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, while an intervention trial indicated that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and decreasing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. Prior studies, however, did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes, and participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, an aMed diet score was calculated from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital, autopsy, or death records. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variability for individuals and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal events.\n\nIncreased adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 incident stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annum of 2007, the United States found itself in the throes of a catastrophic financial calamity. Unemployment surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous prominent American corporations were left in financial oblivion. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting the query: whence did this crisis originate, and how may we forestall such occurrences in the future? Simply put, the financial crisis was unleashed by a combination of self-serving and naive political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into issuing subprime loans upon an already fragile and insufficient financial framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to guarantee and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and managed to pass this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately spreading the contagion throughout the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this financial crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton presidency, as the administration sought to secure a second term by bolstering its popularity. To achieve this, lending restrictions were relaxed, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times, in 1999, reported, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income individuals, and felt the pressure of shareholders to maintain its extraordinary profit growth.”\n\nHolmes accurately prophesied the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, necessitating a government bailout akin to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As expounded in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, imprudent lending would indeed precipitate an economic meltdown.\n\nNumerous factors conspired to plunge the economy into disarray, one of which was the evolving nature of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively employed in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets to become excessively leveraged in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities found themselves in dire straits. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which constituted approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a steep discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to convert into commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Ah, the bridge between the opening act and the main event. The point where you're either soaring on clouds of eloquence or crashing into the abyss of boredom. Dr. Merlin, herself, has been known to let out a few choice expletives when she finds herself stuck in a quagmire of info overload, the kind that's not fun or engaging.\n\nExposition, dear reader, is not your ally.\n\nYou're already aware of the fundamental rule of writing, \"Show, Don't Tell.\" Yet, Dr. Merlin still finds herself tripping over long, unyielding paragraphs where nothing of consequence happens, or worse, too much. It's that little voice in your head urging you to get the background out of the way to get to the good stuff, not to be confused with the other voice whispering that you should share every last detail of your characters' backstories.\n\nExposition is the act of relaying information to the audience, typically in straightforward prose. In movies, it's that scene where a character dumps a massive amount of information on another character, like a monologue from the \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nConsider this: As you're reading a tale, you're told about a heroine's love story. She met her beloved at a certain place and time, theymarried in a grand ceremony, and her husband was murdered right in front of her. You wouldn't expect this sequence to take up two whole pages, with both characters only uttering a couple of lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing his love for the heroine through words and actions, and she, in turn, would demonstrate how his presence transformed her life in big and small ways. A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you feel his loss deeply and give you insight into the heroine's thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes. You'd mourn his death with her, and thus become more invested in her story.\n\nIn other words, you'd expect substance, not just a bare-bones narrative: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance. Sometimes, it's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he used to be in the military, now works at a gas station, has been married twice, no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, and secretly dreams of owning the gas station sometime. You'd want to show these details, not just state them.",
            "In two broadcast updates from Columbus, Ohio, an NBC 4 morning segment (August 13, 2011) led with a developing incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was arrested for stabbing his spouse; his mug shot was aired, depicting a menacing demeanor. The piece ran briefly, about two minutes, given the fluid nature of the situation.\n\nA separate morning update highlighted a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, involving a young man named Travis Buyers, who was critically injured. Authorities were investigating; no arrests had been made. This story was concise, a pattern I've noticed with minority victims, often receiving less attention than their white counterparts. This lack of coverage is a consistent issue.\n\nThe broadcast also touched on a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nAn upcoming weather forecast for the weekend was brief, mentioning afternoon thunderstorms and highs in the mid-to-low eighties. This segment was short, perhaps to pique interest for future updates.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF store featured a black man, who was dark-skinned and approximately six feet tall, weighing about 150 pounds. The report seemed to emphasize his race, which I found unnecessary.\n\nAn additional story detailed Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic former drug kingpin convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. While he was sentenced to 300 months, the report noted his ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant.",
            "The connection between siblings is profound, a tether that neither time nor distance can sever. Among its many facets are sentiments like affection, admiration, envy, and spite. Siblings understand each other in ways that others never could, seeing in their brother's eyes a reflection of their own soul. These emotions are most vividly displayed in times of crisis, whether good or ill. When these feelings are laid bare, they come with a price. Part of comprehending the emotional ties of this familial bond is grappling with their repercussions. When one gazes into their brother's eyes, they see not the world's perception of them, but their true self. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions reveal their genuine character. In the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. In a setting rich with vivid description, these two boys embark on an ill-fated journey. Disappointment and pride clash in the story's climax, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the protagonist's direct portrayal and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the protagonist's intricate feelings and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are fueled by a singular emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. He envisioned a brother with whom he could share his skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He dreamed of a brother to race to Horsehead Landing with and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, these aspirations were dashed by Doodle's frail heart. The young protagonist was filled with wild fantasies, only to have them shattered in a moment. He even contemplated harming the small child, considering suffocating him with a pillow. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle merely smiled at him. This display of love was a testament to the protagonist's true feelings, despite his initial thoughts of infanticide. Deep down, he cared for his brother.",
            "The neural matrix, a complex, imaginative data-processing system, has seen its descriptive analogies evolve with technological progress. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll, followed by a tome, and lately, to a digital device, these metaphors, while useful, have limitations and can mislead. As your exploration of the brain unfolds, remember the restricted utility of these analogies and their potential pitfalls.\nSensory organs convert physical stimuli, like touch, warmth, sound waves, or light particles, into electrochemical signals, initiating information intake. The brain then continuously converts this data, employing both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details such as color, orientation, and border positions to infer a box. Top-down processing, leveraging earlier decisions from the bottom-up process, accelerates the recognition of the object as a black box versus a box-like void in the white backdrop.\nAn attentional gate subsequently determines the significance of the signal and the cognitive processes it should engage. In a grass-filled field, your brain processes every blade, yet an efficient attentional gate prevents individual perception unless the signal is deemed noteworthy, like your name in a noisy environment. This process occurs in multiple stages, with the results continuously shaped by attention.\nInformation processing necessitates storage. Various memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies based on the type of stimulus. Verbal input, for instance, can be structured, referring to visual form, phonemic, relating to sound, or semantic, signifying meaning. Once stored, information must be sustained. Working memory, lasting around 20 seconds, is thought to be maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained structurally via certain proteins.\nMultiple theories describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from subjects' memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network theory posits nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relevance. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes aim at the looming perils of technology and capitalism in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this society, collective welfare trumps individuality, and citizens are indoctrinated from birth to prioritize immediate contentment. The populace serves as mere cogs in a larger machine, bound by the World Controller's dictates. Through the lens of Marxist ideology, one discerns Huxley's reservations concerning the burgeoning economic systems of his time. Concepts like homogeneity and reification are evident in his critique, implying that the novel is a commentary on the shortcomings of the emerging capitalist economy.\n\n Capitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are kept in the dark about their true economic ties to other classes, fixated instead on personal gain. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, a tactic employed in Brave New World. The populace, divided into classes such as Delta and Gamma, have no genuine agency, their desires for consumption and indulgence amplified through hypnopædia. This manipulation is evident in the World Controller's influence. The idea of hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a separate group, is clearly present. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, 'buying into' the ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, though capable of understanding, often accept their status. Characters like Bernard exemplify this, with few Alphas and Betas doing more than contentedly accepting their role. The interactions between social classes underscore the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThe novel presents a world where meaningful relationships are absent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley implies that the confluence of technology and capitalism stifles free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by superficial interactions. Men comment on women primarily in terms of their physical attributes, while women discuss their encounters flippantly. Each class' willingness to accept their place in the hierarchy mirrors the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience suggests a proletariat mindset, content with their superior status so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, or roughly four and a half semesters. Like many, navigating campus can be challenging. My freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm room, located quite far eastward, save for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to distant locations like the Willard Building, near the campus core, could take up to 25 minutes, particularly on inclement days, which are frequent in State College. An alumni, only slightly older than me, shared that East Halls was once isolated by expansive, unused land. Now, that empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings including the Creamery and Health Services, and surrounding apartment complexes. As campus growth continues, travel between points becomes increasingly cumbersome. A feasible solution? Bicycles! However, merely having bikes won't suffice. Students must use them, and campuses must accommodate them.\n\nMy friend recently resumed cycling after a break and commented, \"Bikes are fantastic – they're the best way to commute. For a while, it wasn't popular to ride, but it's the most efficient mode of transportation.\" Bicycling is not only beneficial for health but also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can cover 30 miles or more. I now live off-campus, as distant from the center as some dorms. The wisest decision this year was investing in a bike. My classes in Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk from home, can take just 5 minutes by bike, if pedaled quickly. The main issue is Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, which isn't always easy to traverse. Walking is a valid option, but my schedule's too busy for that. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable transport. Walking to Thomas daily would add 30-40 minutes to my day, roughly 2.5 hours weekly, plus extra time for other classes, appointments, etc."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "In my academic journey towards a degree in social work, my sights are set on a future with the Division of Family and Children Services. Here, I am determined to lend a helping hand to children affected by abuse or neglect, and to support vulnerable families in distress. The values I aim to bring to this field are service, respect, integrity, a commitment to fostering healthier relationships, and a resolve to continually enhance my professional skills. These core principles are not just integral to social work, but are deeply ingrained within me personally.\n\nMy initial fascination with helping others was sparked in high school and college, witnessing individuals retreat from their challenges in denial or employing unhealthy coping strategies. Unsure of my professional direction, I pursued a Bachelor’s in Psychology. Post-graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a year off to explore my options. During this time, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from his abusive parents. The following day, I learned he had called the police. Impelled by a desire to assist, I drove to his parents’ house. After speaking with the police, I intervened with the parents, who seemed defensive and attributed their son’s distress to his “manipulative” behavior. This encounter ignited a resolve within me to pursue social work and support children navigating family conflicts.\n\nThe principle of social justice is a pillar that resonates strongly in the field of social work. Our society lauds the individual, yet often, our societal norms propagate conformity rather than uniqueness. If we genuinely mourn those who perish, why do we strive to emulate the masses? I stand for individuality and have consistently challenged social injustices throughout my academic years. My actions include unconventional hair colors, personalized clothing choices, and piercing beyond the norm, as well as advocating for equality within the GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance) and opposing racism and discrimination. I am committed to championing social justice and will continue to voice my opposition against injustices.",
            "The following investigation delves into the Biological and Sociocultural perspectives concerning the sleep disorder insomnia. The Biological model centers on inherited genetic information and health-related facets. Conversely, the Sociocultural models examine environmental factors and their impact on demographics such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This review of insomnia explores these models, presenting specific research to elucidate them. The research findings are subsequently evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three main categories: primary sleep disorders, secondary sleep disorders, and those due to other issues. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, whereas secondary sleep disorders are linked to mental disorders or other medical complications. Dyssomnias encompass a range of sleep issues like Primary Insomnia and Primary Hypersomnia, while Parasomnias involve behavioral and physiological disturbances during sleep. The review focuses primarily on insomnia and primary sleep disorders, with a broader look at their relation to the Biological and Sociocultural models.\n\nThe Biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes genetic and physiological aspects. Orexin neurons in the hypothalamus regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study utilizing mice demonstrated that the GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are crucial for sleep/wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and sleep. Administration of a GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that human models can be extrapolated from these findings. This implies that genetic and environmental factors influence the physical GABAB receptor in humans, potentially disrupting sleep without medication. Socioculturally, if this phenotype is inherited, it could naturally regulate sleep, impacting daily tasks and focus.",
            "This composition delves into three facets of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a succinct definition of the disorder is presented. Secondly, the diagnostic process is elucidated, including notable symptoms, or \"red flags\". Lastly, the paper concludes with strategies that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom setting can employ to assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), \"refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Specifically, (C)AP involves the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and generates electrophysiologic auditory potentials\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning individuals with CAPD may not properly interpret what they hear, despite normal hearing ability. Their brains do not effectively translate sounds into comprehensible information, such as separating words or discerning conversation from background noise.\n\n\tThe earliest reference to the disorder that evolved into CAPD dates back to the mid-1950s, known as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), when researchers examined children with communication disorders. The Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 sparked increased research on children with CAPD.\n\n\tCAPD presents in various forms: individuals may struggle to locate or discern sounds in space, discriminate between multiple acoustic events, recognize sound patterns, identify changes in speech (such as detecting sarcasm), be obstructed when one sound is followed by another, have difficulty synthesizing sound clues, or determine the sequence of auditory information presented (Ferre).\n\n\tTo diagnose CAPD, a patient must undergo a systematic evaluation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function, which may be administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, or others using various measures that assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This could include questionnaires, observations of auditory behaviors, responses to specific stimuli, or more advanced tests recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring responses. There is no singular diagnostic tool or known cause for the disorder at present.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" suggests that while impersonation can indeed aid in sustaining prolonged deceptions, it ultimately necessitates the disavowal of one's assumed persona, lest one becomes irrevocably entangled within it. Yet, terminating a deception presents its own set of predicaments, as one might find themselves estranged from those around them. The quandary then lies in choosing between the preservation of one's true self and the sustenance of relationships with others. While some may react indifferently to the revelation of deception, others may feel betrayed and offended by the ruse.\n\nThe theme of gender disguise poses a particular challenge, raising questions like why one might feel compelled to assume the guise of the opposite gender. In Viola's case, it is clear that her transformation is a strategy for self-preservation: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249) Arriving in a foreign land, Viola adopts a male persona to safeguard herself from potential harm. Her plan succeeds, but it also isolates her from female company, depriving her of vital support. Moreover, Viola's successful impersonation leads Olivia to confuse her with Sebastian and fall in love: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138) Additionally, she must manage her suppressed romantic feelings towards Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1.260-261)\n\nDespite this, \"Twelfth Night\" might be interpreted as demonstrating how deception can catalyze the expression of suppressed emotions, particularly in the instances of Olivia and Orsino. Some passages hint that these characters may harbor unacknowledged desires that Viola/Cesario's presence compels them to confront. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario due to his apparent maleness, or does she secretly have feelings for women? It is doubtful that Olivia's affections are truly romantic, as Shakespeare's character often satirizes those who judge others solely based on appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from Cesario to Sebastian, and her newfound familial regard for Cesario/Viola: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315)",
            "The harsh realities of German colonial rule, particularly the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa, have been widely documented. However, a comprehensive understanding of the empire's educational landscape cannot be reduced to such a simplistic portrayal. The German colonial empire was characterized by a great disparity in policies and governance across its various territories, as well as in the educational provisions it offered. While the British takeover of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919 revealed a significant populace of educated and literate Africans, Germany's educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies were also acknowledged by contemporary observers. The situation in South West Africa (now Namibia) was markedly different. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively promoted state-run schools and played a pivotal role in the education of indigenous populations, in South West Africa, the responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies with minimal government backing. Meanwhile, the government allocated substantial resources to European education, establishing a robust system of state schools and actively supporting and overseeing missionary institutions. These educational policies had enduring ramifications for South West Africa, even after the departure of German rule. Despite the presence of literate and educated Africans in other German colonies, in South West Africa, \"the overwhelming majority of the populace remained uneducated and illiterate.\" A range of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to explore these factors in depth, with a focus on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous population.\nResearch on education within the German colonial empire is extensive, with many sources originating from the early twentieth century and written in German. These early works primarily sought to describe the educational systems in these colonies. Subsequent English-language studies expanded this discourse through comparative analyses and more detailed examinations of specific educational aspects. These studies highlighted significant variations in educational systems across different colonies. Cohen's work, which compares the educational systems of South West Africa and East Africa, is particularly notable. Cohen attributes many of South West Africa's distinctive educational features to its substantial settler population.\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa enjoyed a moderately temperate climate, with much of the territory covered by arid desert. This made the colony more hospitable to European settlers. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, whereas only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The categorization of Popular Music has evolved significantly over the last century to encompass an extensive array of genres. The sheer number of these genres has made it challenging to enumerate them all collectively, as many—from rap to rock, country to jazz, and folk—have birthed multiple subgenres and subsubgenres. Notably, the subgenre of Heavy Metal rock has emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive genres within the realm of popular music over the past four decades. Its expressive nature is evident through its wide-ranging emotional spectrum, though it often veers toward the darker nuances. The genre's flexibility has fostered the creation of numerous subgenres and subsubgenres, with this chain of diversification continuing to this day. Today, the heavy metal scene has fragmented into so many niches that defining the core essence of heavy metal has become an arduous task. It has infiltrated themes from various other genres, yet it finds its roots in a specific source. To comprehend the sprawling landscape of metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the essence of the metal movement and its status as a movement, rather than merely a genre.\n\nMetal, in essence, is a movement characterized by darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality. It is distinguished by a departure from primitivism and an emphasis on technical proficiency, with musicians showcasing their skills through their instruments. Moreover, metal is inherently tied to the influence of substance use. The mid-70s psychedelic drug boom catalyzed a surge in experimental, otherworldly recordings, with drugs serving as a conduit for musical exploration. This genre possesses raw, visceral qualities, which was a novel departure from the mainstream music's emotional palette. Furthermore, subsequent generations of metal musicians have drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements prevalent in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as those from the song \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify the darker themes that are integral to the movement. This song, considered by some as one of the pioneers of Heavy Metal, was a response to a Rolling Stones track that leaned heavier and darker, with The Beatles aiming to prove their ability to match the Stones' intensity.",
            "Decades prior to the Surrealists' inception of their dreamlike art, an artist named Henri Rousseau was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. The Dream, Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, is not merely a depiction of a woman captivated by her dream landscape; it also encapsulates his personal aspirations and internal conflict. Throughout his career, he yearned for acceptance, respect, and admiration from fellow artists and enthusiasts, yet faced a troublesome dilemma: should he conform to or mimic established painting styles to gain recognition, or should he maintain his unique creative independence? To fully appreciate The Dream through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's biographical narrative. Born in Laval, France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau hails from humble beginnings. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed middle-class prosperity. Lacking formal artistic training, Rousseau worked as a municipal toll service employee until the age of forty, earning the nickname \"douanier.\" After his first wife's death and the tragic loss of eight infant children, leaving him with just one daughter, Julia, Rousseau turned to painting for solace and renewal. Unlike his contemporaries, who often glorified peasant life in their art, Rousseau was a self-taught folk artist, embodying the hopes and dreams of his working-class peers.\n\nRousseau's desire for acceptance in the art world is not merely understandable but also plausible, given his circumstances. He lacked formal training, started his artistic journey later in life, and coexisted with better-known contemporaries. The book Modern French Painters by Jan Gordon clarifies the distinction between Rousseau and contemporaries such as Matisse: \"Matisse was driven by a fear of clichéd painting, whereas Rousseau's aim was to create a conventional work that would secure his admission to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Numerous philosophers have suggested a profound intertwining of ethics and aesthetics, of truth and beauty. I hold that at the core of this lies a reason, one which John Keats articulated in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of life's knowledge comes from education or experience. Yet, we seem to value ethics and aesthetics without formal instruction. Both are attempts to describe rather than prescribe, seeking explanations for beauty or morality rather than rules for judgment. Art and moral criticism often fall short in capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful. A discussion of the Mona Lisa's worth might delve into technical details, but these don't capture why it's great art. We frequently use phrases like \"There's just something about it\" to describe our favorites. Both art and morality resist complete description. Flannery O'Connor and Wittgenstein echo this, emphasizing the ineffable nature of both. This \"je ne sais quoi\" in art and morality is their most potent trait, linking them. As McKean suggests, literature's moral quality is unique, as it uniquely engages our values and life itself. This noumenal impact, where we experience but can't fully explain, strengthens this link.",
            "Present-day Germany is regarded as a formidable entity, a cohesive nation that is home to diverse cultural elements, from the alpine shadows of Munich to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel. This unique cultural tapestry can be felt in cities like Cologne on the Rhine, spanning the heart of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden along the Elbe. Given this rich cultural heritage, it's no surprise that modern Germany is a fusion of various influences and tribes.\n\nThe nomenclature \"Germania\" is shrouded in historical debate. Some scholars attribute the name to a Germanic tribe called the Tungrians, who were once known as Germans before crossing the Rhine to engage in conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98 AD). Julius Caesar, in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, utilized the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the Gauls he had conquered and those he hadn't, borrowing it from the Gauls themselves (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC). Others suggest the term may derive from the Germanic word for spear, \"ger,\" or from the Old Irish term \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" indicating the Germans' loud or noisy nature (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his 98 AD treatise \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" described the Germans as indigenous and unmixed by other races. He pondered, \"Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its harsh landscape, inclement skies, and sullen demeanor, unless it were their native land?\" (Tacitus, 98 AD). Meanwhile, the Romans, with their extensive empire, typically sent their conquests into Germania for trade and occasionally led land campaigns before returning home (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).\n\nAs Germanic tribes began surfacing in the first century, they lived on the outskirts of the Roman Empire, trading their land-derived goods and military skills within the Roman ranks (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "Gazing downwards, I observed the scene before me, my mind blank and unfeeling.  I was an impartial spectator, studying the image without attaching any personal interpretation or emotion.  Thoughts came and went, as if on a conveyor belt, I merely witnessed them.  I felt no sense of ownership over my thoughts, just a fluid awareness of the visual data presented.  I had, once upon a time, been advised by an artistic colleague to purchase a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  My enthusiasm for drawing had begun at age six, and this book delved into the fundamentals, from the nature of pencils to the brain's interpretative processes.  One method it taught was to visualize a square frame around any subject, transforming complex scenes into manageable units.  Standing before the bowl, I was awestruck, unable to impose this technique.  The room was filled with the grandeur of art history, from Picasso's blue phase to Monet's greenery, and I felt a sense of inadequacy, but also a spark of inspiration.  I picked up my tool, muscles tensing and relaxing, my thoughts shaping the action.  The toilet, however, was less cooperative, the offending brown mass defying my attempts to dislodge it.  After a few futile attempts, I resorted to wrapping the toilet paper around my hand like an oven mitt, then slowly dipped my hand into the bowl, reminiscent of a mother preparing a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The youth of America face a significant threat on our highways—teen drivers, numerous fatalities. This state of affairs is a convergence of several factors. The National Institutes of Health provide that a key challenge is the developing teenage brain, not yet equipped to navigate driving's perils. Inexperience is another culprit, leading to more fatal crashes, frequent rollovers, excessive speeding, and road departures. Peer influence exacerbates the problem, as teens often drive with their friends, a practice any sensible person would acknowledge.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses restricting teen driving hours and barring minor passengers. However, these are mere band-aids, the core issue being that collectively, young drivers lack the skill set to manage driving's hazards. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman contends that even 18 is too young for unrestricted driving. He has found that teens under 19-20 crave thrills, increasing risk-taking.\n\nThus, delaying driving until this tendency subsides would be prudent. Failure to do so may lead to escalating fatalities. By 2010, the Baby Boomer children will be eligible, adding millions of new teen drivers to the roads.\n\nA feasible legislative solution could involve continuing driver education in schools but barring teens under 18 from driving. Provisional permits could be issued, with the same practical training hours as most states. Uniform national legislation would be logical and effective in safeguarding teens nationwide.\n\nThe proposed legislation isn't uncharted territory.",
            "Upon sifting through the Library of Congress's archives, I encountered a collection of early Edison films, specifically fifteen trick films spanning from 1895 to 1901. These films are notable for their clever editing techniques, which create illusions. My analysis, primarily, was centered around elucidating the poetic elements of the majority of these trick films and scrutinizing the outliers in the latter films. Generally, the trick films of the turn of the century were confined within the boundaries of a stage, employing a frontal proscenium, static camera positioning, and a strict adherence to long and medium shots, with each shot comprising a complete film. Yet, some films at the dawn of the twentieth century did diverge from these norms by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA prevailing similarity amongst these trick films is their filming within a stationary interior set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains fixed, never moving to follow figures or objects. This compositional choice was deeply rooted in the theatre and vaudeville traditions, particularly for trick films. However, this static stage setup constrains movement to horizontal, with figures moving side-to-side without approaching or receding from the camera. Consider the sequence in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right and move back and forth along the horizontal axis, yet the camera does not track them.\n\nThe frontal proscenium format also dictates shot lengths, with long shots being the norm and medium shots less frequent. Close-ups are entirely absent. This adherence to theatrical and vaudevillian traditions, where the audience views the entire performance at once, framed by the stage, eliminates close-ups, with actors not moving towards the camera. The format of one conceptual shot per film limits their length to about a minute or less, depending on frames per second. This also restricts their narrative or dramatic potential, with most focusing on short vaudeville-style tricks, like magic, disappearing acts, or switches, with minimal story. Notably, in a trick film, a conceptual shot in the viewer's perception is not equivalent to a physical shot. A single \"shot\" may comprise multiple physically distinct shots joined to create an illusion, as seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895). A closer examination reveals the precise moment when the physical shot of Mary's \"severed head\" begins, despite the film appearing as a single unified shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor, hailing from Caroline, was an early and passionate advocate for the Republican cause. His background in agriculture and a brief political career instilled in him a tenacious commitment to individual liberties and governance. His agricultural pursuits and political experiences shaped his views on government, with his promotion of an agrarian system as the cornerstone of his beliefs on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system.\n\nTaylor envisioned a unique opportunity for the United States to establish an ideal governance system, free from native traditions that could hinder its creation. He firmly believed in the inherent interdependence of natural rights, asserting that denying one right diminishes the value of all. Consequently, he argued that these rights should be shielded from government interference.\n\nIn his quest for an ideal society, Taylor held that a government must acknowledge the good and evil within humanity. He adhered to a dualistic morality, asserting that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, enhance agriculture, and subdue capitalism, and believed that a government founded on such principles would function equitably despite its administrators' potential self-interest.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He favored a minimalist Federal government, restricting its powers to those explicitly stated. He recognized that an expansive Federal government could become oppressive due to its cost. However, he cautioned that a purely literal interpretation could lead to corruption, necessitating consideration of the writers' intent. Moreover, he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it more clearly describes the country as a union of sovereign states rather than a singular nation.",
            "Upon reviewing Figure 17, it was observed that commuter log submissions plummeted in the third month of the project. This was somewhat discouraging, and the reason behind it was not readily apparent. Considering that this period coincides with the onset of winter in a New England locale, it's plausible that the dip in bicycle and pedestrian commuting played a role. Additionally, December marks the end of the academic semester, leaving many preoccupied with final tasks and grading, which could have led to the log submisions being overlooked. Furthermore, December is a holiday month, with a subsequent break for both students and faculty, reducing campus attendance significantly. The resumption of classes in late January might also explain the low number of February submissions. However, the dip in February remains unexplained. It's possible that the initial enthusiasm for such projects often wanes over time. To address this, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, which did manage to boost log submissions. Thus, one challenge was sustaining project momentum amidst natural ebbs and academic breaks.\n\nAnother significant hurdle for this project, and similar initiatives, is the widespread preference for driving. This behavior is deeply ingrained in our culture. Therefore, it's crucial to offer incentives to encourage alternative modes of commuting. We offered various prizes, including gift cards for local businesses and even a few national chains. It's intriguing to consider whether even larger prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, could have further increased participation. The value of these prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, increasing their value over time could have potentially boosted engagement. While gift cards seemed sufficient at the outset, announcing more substantial prizes in December and January might have enticed more participation and mitigated the initial decline.",
            "An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a financial product that mirrors an index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to an index fund, yet offers more flexibility as it trades like a stock on an exchange. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs provide the benefits of diversification and ownership akin to single stocks, including short selling, margin buying, and purchasing as little as one share per transaction. Despite these advantages, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to mutual funds. However, there are trade-offs; every ETF transaction incurs a commission, similar to stock trades. Another plus side is the broad range of available funds. It is prudent for discerning investors to scrutinize these claimed benefits, ensuring they exist and are substantial. For this study, we examine ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, accounting for 63.58% of its assets, to assess whether owning a single ETF yields benefits similar to a diversified portfolio of these ten stocks. We also explore if there's a more optimal stock configuration offering a better Sharpe ratio or return.",
            "A notable work in Edgar Allan Poe's oeuvre is \"Dream-Land,\" which he esteemed amongst his finest creations. In this piece, Poe deploys the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, a reference traced by Mabbott back to Virgil. Virgil, in turn, employed this term to denote an island beyond the northern reaches of Britain, an extremity of the known world to the Greeks. While Virgil's usage is undeniable, a more contemporary influence could be acknowledged. Poe, fascinated by German literature, would have encountered this term through his readings of Goethe.\n\nThis is of significance as it illuminates Poe's intimacy with Goethe's works. Karl J. Arndt, in his tome \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallel lines between the two poets' compositions, suggesting Poe's imitation of Goethe.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature lauds Goethe as a luminary of poetic drama, particularly for his magnum opus \"Faust,\" released in two installments, the first in 1808 and the second upon his death in 1832. Within the latter part of Faust, a short poem entitled \"The King of Thule\" appears, depicting a monarch whose life unravels after the death of his wife and the gifting of a goblet. Driven to despair, he ultimately sacrifices himself and his possessions, save for the goblet, which he casts into the sea. This narrative bears a striking resemblance to the emotional landscape of \"Dream-Land,\" with its melancholic speaker haunted and desolate, echoing Poe's grief and possibly his own struggles with alcohol.\n\nPoe's invocation of Thule is not isolated to \"Dream-Land\"; he employs the phrase \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" The use of the term as bookends in \"Dream-Land\" further underscores its significance. \"The King of Thule\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as companion pieces, with the latter's dark, lonely Thule mirroring Goethe's desolate king and his own poignant loss. The speaker's description of this realm as a haunted, colorless, and shaded world resonates with the despair of Goethe's king, as if Poe had stepped into Goethe's poem.\n\nGoethe's importance cannot be overstated; Poe would have been familiar with his works, at the very least through Tennyson's admiration for him. When queried about his esteem for Tennyson, Poe also expressed his respect for Goethe, likely having encountered his works through various reproductions.",
            "In accordance with California law, could a customer injured following a slip-and-fall on a spilled applesauce in a supermarket be awarded punitive damages by demonstrating that the store manager acted with ill intent because he was informed of the spill twice and did not clear it for half an hour due to dining?A judge is unlikely to promptly dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To establish that punitive damages are merited, a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were carried out with willful and deliberate disregard for probable harm, as well as evidence that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer can argue that Martin should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple incidents of slipping had occurred prior to her accident, and despite this knowledge, he failed to address the issue. While Palmer's assertion that Martin's actions were reprehensible is less convincing, it remains reasonable under the circumstances, considering six slip-and-fall incidents had transpired in 2009 and Martin still failed to implement adequate measures to ensure store safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 PM, Richard Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, notified his supervisor, Paul Martin, about an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on his dinner break and \"didn't have time to handle customer complaints.\" At 5:15 PM, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Mr. Martin about the spill, and he responded similarly. By 5:30 PM on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a severe back injury. Before Palmer's accident, five separate slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages due to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial dismissal of the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that must be \"despicable\" and committed with \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" id. at § (c)(1). Courts have labeled conduct as malicious when, knowing the probable harmful consequences, a defendant deliberately failed to avoid them. Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979).",
            "Nearly four years ago, I encountered a course on Islam at CBC, where the class frequently debated the contentious issue of whether Islam is inherently hostile. The relevance of this discussion appears to have grown since then, particularly in light of recent global events and the shifting public perception of Islam in the United States. In the aftermath of 9/11, for instance, there's been a noticeable shift from a hostile portrayal of Islam and extremism to an extreme form of tolerance, even to the extent that a candidate with a Muslim background, such as President Barack Obama, could be elected in 2008.\n\nThe Biography of the Prophet Muhammad captures my curiosity as the narrative diverges from historical accounts of his life. In my previous understanding, Muhammad was perceived as a conqueror who compelled tribes to adopt Islam through force. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr who endured misunderstanding and humility. This version of events implies that people increasingly sought out Muhammad after witnessing his teachings' truth.\n\nCertain parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the 'miracles' attributed to Muhammad also intrigue me. For example, the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men echoes the biblical story of Jesus' feeding of the five thousand. This style of storytelling suggests a deliberate attempt to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, emphasizing his acts of truth and miracle, rather than necessitating proofs. This approach, I believe, diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and miracles.\n\nMoreover, many stories in the biography seem to serve an agenda of demonstrating the voluntary nature of conversions to Islam. These accounts often rely on third-party accounts, with information passed down through multiple intermediaries. While intended to bolster the credibility of the stories, this method can actually undermine their authenticity, as it adds layers of hearsay.\n\nWhat troubles me most is the portrayal of Muhammad as a pious, wise, and gentle leader. Historical records contradict this depiction, suggesting a more complex and sometimes harsh figure. Given this disparity, it makes me wonder if modern Muslims are aware of the full spectrum of Muhammad's history and rise to power.",
            "The precepts and convictions espoused by Jesus during his tenure were promptly cast aside as Christian thought evolved post-mortem. A cursory examination of this trajectory reveals a steady drift away from the origin. The contemporary world exhibits an increasing consciousness and an unparalleled progressive inclination. While the traditionalists persist, their influence may not be extensive enough to dictate the whole. Among the adherents, historical acumen will surge in the coming years, sparking a desire to discern the principles appended to Christianity over time from the authentic intentions of its namesake. This pendulum swing may take decades or even centuries, but the reversal is assured: Christianity will revert to its primordial form. A swell will emerge, peeling back the layers of doctrine, much like the hands of a clock turning backward, until only the essence of what Jesus introduced to humanity remains. When this wave sweeps across the United States and Europe, swaying the masses to revere as if we were living in Jesus' time, following solely his thoughts, the institutional church will remain steadfast in guiding the way. However, with the theological clock reversed, the proliferation of diversity within Christendom will diminish, giving way to uniformity of belief and practice. Regional, denominational, and sectarian differences will yield to growing similarities. History is replete with such reversals. Case in point: Christians were once persecuted and killed by the Roman Empire, yet the empire later became a Christian power. Our nation has evolved from African-American slavery to African-American leadership. The upcoming reversal in Christianity will unfold, undoing history to return to the source and diminishing diversity in its path. This progression hinges on an interpretative approach to Jesus' words, viewing them as metaphorical rather than literal. So, what has transpired since Jesus' life?\n       A deep dive into history reveals that Judaism, the theological precursor to Christianity, was predominant. Monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures were the bedrock of the religion by the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E. The Jewish populace was not unified; they were divided into groups such as Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "The narrative of \"The Jungle\" reveals the inherent inclination of humans to prioritize self-interest and disregard the well-being of others. In Sinclair's world, the executives and overseers of the sprawling factories represent this self-serving nature. They are solely focused on amassing power and wealth, oblivious to the havoc their actions wreak. The author employs vivid imagery to highlight the consequences of their unchecked ambition, \"The buildings stood tall and proud against the sky, their smokestacks spewing clouds of smoke that stretched towards infinity.\" This visual is a stark depiction of the environmental devastation caused by their relentless pursuit of progress.\n\nThe indifference extends to the employees, who are mere tools in their pursuit of profit. Workers are subject to grueling schedules and sudden layoffs without recompense, all in the name of maximizing efficiency. In the absence of protective regulations, exploitation was rife. The employers held a stranglehold over their workforce, much like slave owners, with workers having no recourse or support. The narrative hints at the dehumanizing conditions, \"The workers, many of whom were immigrants, lived in a perpetual state of poverty and desperation, their lives contingent on the caprices of their masters.\" Unions, intended to advocate for the workers, often exacerbated the suffering, further entrenching the system of exploitation that defined Packingtown.",
            "Multiple authors deploy varied methods to evoke specific sentiments in their audiences. Among these techniques, F. Scott Fitzgerald employs several in his novel \"The Great Gatsby.\" Occasionally, he pairs adjectives with nouns in unconventional ways to impart a certain vibe around a subject. He also ascribes significance to symbols and uses them to achieve the same effect. In his work, Fitzgerald assigns meaning to numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. He builds up these meanings and subsequently employs them to trigger certain emotions when encountering significant objects.\n\nIn \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald associates white/gray with uniformity, with white connoting elegance and sophistication, and gray symbolizing age and weariness. He establishes this association early in the novel through frequent references to both colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently \"in white,\" and even Nick dons \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party. Tom wears a \"white shirt\" when meeting Myrtle. The only departure from this white prevalence occurs when Nick is first introduced to Gatsby's party, where the halls are \"gaudy with primary colors.\" This color coding extends to various mundane subjects, such as the \"white chasms of lower New York,\" \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable, and even the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes. Fitzgerald further reinforces this uniformity by describing common people or places in these colors, including the \"white girlhood\" of Jordan and Daisy, and the \"gray\" Italian child on the railroad.\n\nOnce Fitzgerald has established these meanings, he uses white/gray to signify unimportance or uniformity. This technique begins with Daisy, who, after a prolonged absence of either color in the story, is described as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster.\" Readers begin to perceive Daisy as less of a character and more like a uniform addition, a mere object of Gatsby's desire. This use of color continues with references to a \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" and her being in a \"white\" dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County, due to its temperate and sunny climate, is a notable agricultural powerhouse. Crops that flourish here include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture in the region, with several local organizations boasting lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms not only offer tours of their operations but also facilitate activities like hiking and birdwatching. Such enterprises can leverage government programs to enhance habitat quality, create recreational spaces, and generate income or educational opportunities. Organic farming, while more demanding in terms of labor and management, can foster greater biodiversity. However, it may also incur higher costs and experience greater crop losses. Non-organic practices beneficial to wildlife can also add to labor expenses. Thus, a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise to balance profits and habitat conservation. The selected land is a 160-acre parcel near Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. It's part of the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, home to over a hundred species, many endangered or declining. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later used by cattle ranchers. The property was originally part of a homestead and likely used for grazing and wood production. Researching available government programs and exploring a nearby organic farm provided insights into potential cost mitigation and wildlife-friendly farming practices.",
            "Cultural nuances are pivotal in any negotiation. Culture isn't just about what it is, but also what it isn't and the meaning behind it. It's diverse, multifaceted, and not universally uniform. Generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" are too broad and oversimplified. While understanding cultural norms is beneficial, it's more productive to grasp how a culture's values influence negotiation dynamics. When interacting with foreign cultures, one tends to compare them to their own, which can be insightful but also misleading.\n\nUnderstanding a foreign culture or mindset might involve exploring its history or recognizing its biases. Instead of attempting to alter or judge a culture, one should accept it as is and operate within its parameters, especially when negotiations are involved, and particularly if one is in a weaker position. Being on \"foreign\" turf necessitates respect for traditions and beliefs, which can transcend cultural hurdles and facilitate negotiations.\n\nCulture isn't confined to national or international contexts. Many companies within a nation develop their own unique corporate culture, evident in dress codes, communication styles, hiring practices, and attitudes towards philanthropy. Even within a single nation, corporate cultures can vary widely, as seen in the differences between American companies. Some cultures appear more uniform, but a closer look reveals their varied nuances.\n\nValues are crucial to decipher, as they explain why a culture behaves a certain way. If preserving face or promoting harmony is valued, a negotiator won't publicly embarrass their company. Conversely, a culture that prioritizes aggressive negotiations won't settle quickly. Recognizing these cultural priorities before negotiations is essential, but learning about the other party's personal values can enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "\"In the Book of Psalms, it is written, 'The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This phrase is central to St. Anselm's reasoning regarding the existence of a deity, and it is also echoed by Thomas Aquinas. To evaluate their arguments, we'll presume they both adhere to the monotheistic belief of the Bible, as they are both defending the same divine figure. This assumption simplifies our comparison, as both arguments are rooted in the same concept of God.\n\nIn examining Anselm's approach, we find that it centers on an inner search for truth. He posits that God's existence can be derived from our understanding, as we cannot imagine His nonexistence. This concept, though complex and sometimes unclear, suggests that God's reality is intrinsic to our minds. Thus, the proof lies within us, requiring no external verification. This notion aligns with Christian teachings, which often refer to this as faith.\n\nConversely, Aquinas advocates for a rationale based on logical reasoning and empirical evidence. His method avoids faith entirely, making it more appealing for converting non-believers, as it relies on reasoning rather than accepting something unprovable. Aquinas presents five logical arguments: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument illustrates that God's existence is a necessary logical conclusion. If one lacks a single piece of a puzzle but can deduce its features and existence from the rest, this is analogous to Aquinas' logical arguments for God's existence.",
            "In the dawn of the fifth or sixth century BCE, a monarch-to-be, later revered as the Buddha, drew breath. His life's journey saw him forsake the world and achieve enlightenment, sparking the birth of Buddhism, with its most traditional branch being Theravada Buddhism. The religion, now over two and a half millennia old, bears little resemblance to its founders' time. This can be observed in Theravada-majority Sri Lanka, where the annual Maha Silavimokkha ceremony is celebrated. Both monks and laypeople participate, despite no mention of such rituals in the Buddha's teachings. These modifications extend from the most outward traditions to the religion's core beliefs. The Theravada Buddhist community, spanning both monastic and lay domains, has adapted its principles over time, influenced by both internal and external factors, both friendly and adversarial.\n\tTo navigate this discussion, several key terms will be frequently used. Here, internal forces refer to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation. External forces encompass those from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are those that pose a threat or intend to harm the Buddhist community, often due to misconceptions about Buddhism. Benign forces, meanwhile, do not wish to harm or aid the community, but may inadvertently do so. These terms will recur throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, let us examine the bedrock of Theravada Buddhism—the doctrines that underpin it. Buddhists take refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma comprises the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist texts. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka includes the religion's metaphysical aspects, such as Anatta (no soul), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles allows one to escape Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, ending lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) upon enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka sets forth life's rules. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: I will not kill, I will not lie, I will not steal, I will not misbehave sexually, and I will not consume intoxicants. Monks follow many more rules. The most foundational doctrinal tenet is the four noble truths: life is Dukkha (suffering), attachment causes suffering, and suffering can be overcome.",
            "The United States of America and Mexico once faced a protracted dispute lasting 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145) The peak of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, during which the United States emerged victorious and gained control of Texas and the southwestern territories. Multiple skirmishes occurred between these nations, tapering off just prior to the First World War. The rivalry stemmed from disagreements over religion, culture, and material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).\n\nThis scenario mirrors many other nations that have ongoing rivalries with their neighbors. Shared borders often lead to conflicting interests, fostering rivalries. The United States and Mexico are no exception. David M. Pletcher (1977) asserts that “Only in Mexico and Cuba does one find enduring American diplomatic issues” (p. 41). Indeed, both nations, being geographically close to the United States, have historically been rivals, unlike many other Latin American countries that have maintained good relations with the United States.\n\nReligious tensions have long divided these nations, a problem that has plagued many throughout history. Sally Frahm (2001) notes that “While in the twentieth century Americans opposed fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they opposed Catholicism and monarchy” (p.86). Similar to the Cold War, the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, this conflict was partly ideological and partly a competition over vital interests. However, the ideological differences were rooted in religious preferences rather than political systems. The distrust stemmed from earlier colonial tensions between the English and Spanish, which hindered the development of peaceful diplomatic relations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) enumerate 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States over the 57-year rivalry period. Most of these disputes centered around territorial issues, with border raids and frontier problems being significant concerns. Outlaw activities from American border towns into Mexican territory posed a major challenge, persisting until both nations strengthened their military presence on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) explains that the rivalry began to subside as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the United States. It finally concluded with a shift in American ambitions, from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, towards the end of the 19th century.",
            "Fifteen years ago, an unforeseen and unanticipated affliction rendered me incapacitated, an illness that I had never been made aware of. At that time, I was pursuing a career as a nurse, a choice made due to a profound desire for the safety and stability that I had lacked during my childhood. \"You'll always find employment; people will always require care\" became the mantra that echoed through my adolescence and beyond. Thus, even though my heart yearned to be a scientist or a journalist, preferably a blend of both, I chose nursing.\n\nHowever, here I am: 46 years old, unmarried, possessing no financial reserves, and unable to work. To this day, I am disabled, and after 15 years of subsisting on Social Security Disability, I have nothing left that is truly mine. I manage to endure, but every day is a battle, an assault on my security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing is certain anymore, yet there is one truth that stands unwavering: I could not have persevered for this long without the support of my kin and a few steadfast friends. And let me assure you, when calamity truly strikes, you feel far from invincible.\n\nThe crux of my argument is that life is full of unpredictability, both large and small. There are no guarantees, and despite our best efforts, some challenges are simply too immense to overcome alone.\n\nI am in complete agreement that we must cease placing all our hopes in the crumbling, leaky vessel that is our government. But I would much prefer to see Americans reclaim their trust in one another, learning to aid each other and to request assistance, rather than each of us retreating to our own backyards to construct fallout shelters.\n\nThe conservatives in the U.S. often extol the virtues of \"rugged individualism\" that supposedly built this nation; however, the resilience of our forefathers in times of hardship was not born of rugged individualism, but of compassion, mutual respect, and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who traversed the Rocky Mountains in wagon trains did not reach the coast by relying solely on their own strength.\n\nAs such, I wholeheartedly recommend preparing for emergencies. I am well-equipped with a disaster kit, first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and plastic sheeting for my windows in the event of a biological attack. I possess multiple flashlights and an abundance of batteries, numerous candles, waterproof matches, and canned goods. If you have the land and resources to maintain a small farm and preserve your own food, do so. It is a commendable endeavor, as is the installation of a wood stove, provided you do not reside in an apartment.\n\nBut alongside these preparations, it is essential to forge connections with your neighbors.",
            "What drives the evolutionary trajectory of organisms? Are there inherent restrictions or constraints that steer the course of biological change? As D'Arcy Thompson acknowledged in 1917, \"Even now the zoologist has barely begun to dream of defining in mathematical terms the simplest organic forms.\" While this sentiment still holds true, advancements in mathematical modeling have been made in understanding mollusk skeletogenesis throughout ontogeny and phylogeny (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to unravel the mechanisms behind the direction and scale of evolutionary-developmental changes in Prunum by integrating mathematical modeling with experimental studies. Using X-ray images of Prunum species, we identified quantitative parameters to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies with the software CerioShell (Stone, 1995). These models help interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, complementing experimental and descriptive studies to illuminate macroevolutionary events within this group.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a cylindrical structure that evolves over time through 360 degrees of space, with each loop or turn referred to as a whorl, spiraling around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The rate at which whorls expand varies, with a continuous boundary separating each one, called a suture. Typically, the largest whorl, known as the body whorl, is the last. The spire encompasses all whorls except the last, with the apex at the top and base at the bottom. The aperture, an opening, is where the animal exits the shell.\n\nShells can be examined from various angles: apical (top view), basal (bottom view), apertural (front view), and abapertural (side view). The standard orientation places the aperture toward the viewer with the apex pointing up.\n\nTo count whorls, start by viewing the shell from the apical perspective and locating the first suture. Draw a line dividing the shell into two sections. Count the whorls from this line, estimating to a quarter of a whorl if necessary.\n\nA shell can be perceived as a series of apertures tracking the animal's growth over time and space. The path of the aperture can be tracked using coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radii.\n\nThis trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical formulation is established, parameters can be altered to modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "For the past decade, neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia has shown little fluctuation. Despite Indonesia's progress towards several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, improvements for child and maternal health remain insufficient to meet 2015 targets. Various factors contribute to these shortfalls, suggesting the need to bolster the healthcare system rather than solely focusing on specific interventions.\n\nIndonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled personnel, with 72% now meeting this criterion. However, this figure includes traditional workers like midwives who cannot administer medical interventions during complex pregnancies, leading to maternal deaths from hemorrhage. Thus, these improvements are somewhat deceptive and further work is needed. Additionally, the proportion of children under five receiving professional treatment for diarrhea has declined. Data on postnatal care is incomplete but shows low rates nationwide.\n\nCesarian-section rates remain low, at 4%, with urban areas having a 7% rate compared to 2% in rural areas. This disparity highlights the issue of limited healthcare access, primarily in rural regions. Moreover, there's a 27% gap in service usage between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles, indicating the poor struggle more to access healthcare services, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nLooking forward to enhancing neonatal and maternal health indicators, the crucial question is how best to tackle the gap in service delivery. Should Indonesia adopt targeted program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall healthcare system without focusing solely on pre- and post-pregnancy care? While programmatic approaches offer clear, manageable objectives and quicker results, they can also lead to funding diversion and duplication of services. For instance, heavy investment in one sector, like HIV/AIDS, can divert resources from another like family planning.",
            "The Victorian period's literature is renowned for its meticulous detail and preoccupation with the upper class. Contrary to this, novels such as Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights diverge, showcasing elements of intrigue and eccentricity that are atypical of the era. These novels use mystery, often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, to delve deeper into characters' motivations and emotions. In Oliver Twist, these strange occurrences reveal Oliver's inner turmoil, his awareness of his plight, and his inability to control his circumstances. The shooting scene in Chapter 28, a vivid dreamlike sequence, demonstrates Oliver's lack of control and the dire straits of his health. The passage emphasizes his desperation and the relentless fear and pain he experiences during the shooting, even as he is removed from the immediate shock. The incident suggests that Oliver's misfortune is not of his own making, reinforcing his helplessness and growing sense of defeat, as if old Fagin is breaking his spirit and stripping him of the ability to react. The shooting highlights the pervasive influence of his fate, which is not under his control. This is underscored by Oliver's inability to muster any response, even in the face of life-threatening danger. The shooting, in this context, serves as a stark reminder of his powerlessness and the extent to which he is a pawn in the hands of external forces.",
            "A few years back, I participated in an after-school program assisting elementary-aged students with their studies. I offered my best efforts to help them in their areas of need, with a particular aptitude for English and reading. An instructor approached me, requesting my assistance with a young boy named Adrian, presumably in third or fourth grade, who was grappling with reading difficulties. It became evident that something was amiss; his pronunciation of certain letters was flawless, while others were completely off. Intrigued, I discovered that Adrian, of Latino descent, spoke English flawlessly but struggled with the alphabet. This revelation occurred when I encountered Adrian's mother, who only communicated in Spanish. Despite my rudimentary Spanish skills, we managed to convey our thoughts. It dawned on me that Adrian could read well but lacked familiarity with the English alphabet. I hope Adrian's reading skills improved since then.\n\nI share this anecdote to highlight the challenges posed by language barriers in schools, especially in California. It also illustrates the complexity of reading difficulties, even for students who speak English fluently. The issue is evident, so what is the solution? In Adrian's case, English reading tutoring, particularly focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is multifaceted and complex. No single approach can solve the problem; the key lies in combining various strategies.\n\nFirstly, the dual language system is a promising approach. Not only for Spanish-speaking students, but for all children. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.\" There's a misconception that this system wastes resources and benefits only a select few. This is untrue. If implemented as the norm, all children would reap its benefits. How can we achieve this? Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical. Instead, special bilingual aids or tutors could be employed to support this system.",
            "Since childhood, we're often introduced to the notion that there's something greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some of us attend religious institutions to learn about it, while others explore within ourselves for answers. Many of us inherit and embrace the faiths passed down by our ancestors, while others reject them entirely. Our paths differ, each one carving out a unique spiritual identity. We all search for guidance in the darkness to guide us into the light.\n\nMy father, when I inquired about his favorite bird, replied \"A cardinal.\" We sat on our porch, the rain drumming on the tin roof above, as we shared cigarettes. The gutters emptied the rain, drowning the plants around us. He gazed into the rain, lost in thought, thinner and weaker than I remembered. His hair had thinned, his clothes loose on his frame. He stared ahead, evading my gaze. I felt isolated, anxious, unable to discuss my fears with him. I embraced him, moved my chair closer, and gazed with him into the June twilight rain.\n\nMy father passed in December, five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments prolonged his suffering, but only by a few months. I couldn't watch him depart this life. I wanted to honor his memory as he lived, not as he died. I curled up in bed for three days, awaiting news.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The conventional \"Gothic Novel\" is essentially a synthesis of \"old\" and \"new\" elements, as elucidated by Ian Watt in his seminal work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. This literary mode has been simultaneously maligned and celebrated, with critics alternately accusing it of superficiality and lauding its 'terrifying grandeur' (Burke). The inception of the \"Gothic Novel\" can be traced back to The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole, which blended both archaic and contemporary romance tropes to birth the fledgling Gothic genre and introduce a novel method of storytelling. Walpole deftly incorporated old theatrical elements and modern mimetic techniques in his \"Gothic Tale\" (Walpole 4), creating a unique fusion that drew from medieval Gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Despite the word \"gothic\" being used to denote various peoples, styles, and eras, it was often viewed as antiquated or unsophisticated amidst the literary and societal advancements of the time. The marriage of these 'Gothic' elements with the novel form, which permitted readers a more intimate glimpse into characters' psyches, ensured the Gothic genre's enduring appeal and its ability to feel both obsolete and fresh to readers removed from its original context.\n\nA notable theme in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto, recasts the medieval ideal of knightly training, embodying both the retention and transformation of this tradition. Chivalry is significant to Gothic writers because it represents the quintessential knight—brave, honorable, and skilled—a stark contrast to the perceived moral decay of contemporary society. By adopting chivalric concepts and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the evolution of Gothic into Romanticism and serving as a means to critique the present. Walpole, writing amidst political turmoil and possibly harboring frustrations with his contemporaries, may have felt that the moral integrity and inherent goodness of the medieval era had been lost in the 'present' society. This sentiment is evident in his portrayal of various characters, notably Frederic, who encapsulates numerous chivalric traits. Before meeting Frederic, the reader is made aware of his chivalric qualities; he is described as:\n\nThe description of him is replete with chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, having endured tragedy and been presumed killed by infidels. The figure of the 'brave, courteous knight' is exaggerated, exemplifying the soon-to-be iconic Gothic trope of excess (66).",
            "The shipment of products, from inception to delivery, constitutes the flow of a supply chain. This concept was introduced in 1982 by a certain consultant named Keith Oliver. He posited that supply chain management encompasses the planning, execution, and oversight of this process to meet customer needs swiftly and effectively. Six fundamental components comprise a supply chain: production, sourcing, stockpiling, placement, transit, and information. Business leaders leverage these elements to offer optimal customer service.\n\nProduction, the first phase, serves as the cornerstone of the supply chain. It dictates the timing, rationale, site, and method of production. To understand customer preferences, managers scrutinize market trends. This analysis enables them to determine which products to produce and in what quantities. Once these decisions are made, managers select the most suitable location for production, considering volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. Post-location selection, managers allocate workloads and maintain equipment. Production is pivotal, with meticulous planning crucial to avoid time and cost discrepancies in the long term. My previous experience at Wal-Mart and Target underscores the importance of structured processes. Detailed layouts and procedures, from employee attire to shipment receipts, foster seamless operations and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key component of supply chain management is sourcing. It involves strategic decisions to define a facility's core capabilities and forge partnerships with external entities. A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with unique equipment, personnel, and specialties. Managers must identify the most suitable division for each production segment. They may also opt to outsource work to external companies to accelerate delivery times, maintain quality, and reduce costs.",
            "Standing on a bustling street corner, Ellen Page, the actress known for her role in Juno, holds a makeshift sign with a peculiar message. The sign reads, \"Adolf Hitler, alive and well in Myanmar.\" This Southeast Asian country, once known as Burma, has long been governed by a brutal military regime that seized power in 1962. In 2007, monks led a wave of street protests, earning the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution.\" Initially, the government permitted peaceful gatherings, but as protests grew, so did the violence, with the military targeting monasteries. Journalists were imprisoned or killed, including Kenji Nagai, who was murdered on September 27, 2007, for merely covering the demonstrations. Officially, 13 people were killed, but defecting Colonel Hla Win claimed thousands more died. This is not an isolated event. Throughout history, leaders have suppressed dissent to maintain their grip on power. From ancient Roman emperors to modern-day heads of state, the pattern is distressingly familiar.\n\nNotable incidents include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, where hundreds to thousands were killed, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, aided by the government, murdered Tutsis and political moderates regardless of ethnicity. Adolf Hitler's campaign of genocide against Jews during World War II stands as a stark reminder of the horrors that can occur when such ideologies are unchecked.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music is attributable to his extensive career and skill in steering his orchestra. While Ellington's keyboard prowess is often understated in many of the compositions analyzed, his forte as a composer shines in his ability to write intricate and multifaceted pieces that highlight individual band member's skills. He crafted a structure that allowed soloists to improvise freely, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged pieces that emphasized specific member's styles to convey musical themes. This approach, which also emphasized the overall tone of the orchestra, resulted in many groundbreaking and brilliant jazz works.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative sound and use of voice as an instrument, citing \"Creole Love Call\" as an early example. This slow, twelve-bar blues piece features six choruses, each showcasing unique solo performances and call-and-response patterns between the voice and reeds, brass, and piano. Ellington's mastery of each player's sound, both individually and as a collective, is evident throughout his career.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" Ellington's orchestration and tone color skills are on full display. A call-and-response between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing integrates vocal elements with instrumental aspects to create a rich, complementary sound. This technique is further evident in \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing),\" where Ellington employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's muted trombone to introduce the melody, showcasing his ear for tone and his ability to complement his soloists.\n\nEllington's use of voice to add depth and color to his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his work. His ability to blend vocal and instrumental elements, highlighting individual player's styles and the ensemble's tone, is a hallmark of his innovative approach to creating jazz music.",
            "Since her early teens, an indescribable yearning had plagued her. It was a longing that remained unquenched, even as years passed. At 14, she began to yearn for something, but three years later, at 17, she realized it wasn't an object but a person that she craved. Yet, none of the boys who showed interest in her managed to pique her curiosity. She often pondered this peculiar condition, trying to rationalize it, but all she had were theories that left her unsatisfied. So, she continued to live her life, perpetually questioning her desires.\n\nOn this particular day, a peaceful home was disrupted. Her parents, generally serene, rarely argued with her, except when she sought to assert her independence. They were a calm couple, and their vivacious daughter was a stark contrast, making her both charming and good-natured.\n\nToday, however, tranquility was shattered. She heard a sharp cry from the kitchen, her mother's voice echoing with distress. She rushed in, her heart pounding, and found her mother on the floor, groaning. \"Mom! What happened?\" she exclaimed, kneeling beside her. Her mother, through gritted teeth, instructed her to take her to the hospital. She complied, using her strength from her fitness classes to carry her mother to the car.\n\nThe sterile scent of the hospital filled her nostrils as she rushed her mother in, her mind focused solely on helping her. A team of doctors swiftly attended to her, leaving her to wait anxiously.\n\nHer mother had been trying to reach a vase from the highest cabinet when she fell off a stool, sustaining an injury.",
            "The investigation aimed to demonstrate that compliance with a \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), as indicated by a high \"alternative Mediterranean (aMed) diet score\", correlates with a diminished likelihood of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke incidence, including stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet is an adaptation of the Med diet, characterized by increased consumption of plant-based foods, such as plant proteins (excluding potatoes but including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes), monounsaturated fats (compared to saturated fats), and fish, along with reduced intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is permissible.\n\nEarlier research has established an inverse relationship between adherence to a Med diet and the risk of overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, while an intervention trial indicated that the Med diet is more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and decreasing the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in overweight individuals. Prior studies, however, did not focus specifically on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological study tracked 74,886 women aged 38 to 63, who had no history of CVD or diabetes, and participated in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over six intervals between 1984 and 2004, an aMed diet score was calculated from self-reported \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. Over 95% of nurses maintained participation throughout the 20-year period. The FFQs underwent validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were confirmed through medical, hospital, autopsy, or death records. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included, accounting for approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo minimize random variability for individuals and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from repeated FFQs were computed (averaging scores from two prior years). Adjustments were made for \"confounders\" (factors that could skew results) by considering age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to examine the association between an aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal events.\n\nIncreased adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a reduced risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 incident stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile exhibited a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "In the annum of 2007, the United States found itself in the throes of a catastrophic financial calamity. Unemployment surged, the housing sector imploded, and numerous prominent American corporations were left in financial oblivion. This economic downturn continues to this day, prompting the query: whence did this crisis originate, and how may we forestall such occurrences in the future? Simply put, the financial crisis was unleashed by a combination of self-serving and naive political decisions that coerced banks and corporations into issuing subprime loans upon an already fragile and insufficient financial framework. Concurrently, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to guarantee and repack these mortgages into CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, banks found themselves short on capital reserves and managed to pass this turmoil onto the repackaged mortgages they had sold, ultimately spreading the contagion throughout the economy.\n\nThe seeds of this financial crisis were sown in 1999 during the Clinton presidency, as the administration sought to secure a second term by bolstering its popularity. To achieve this, lending restrictions were relaxed, setting the stage for the subprime crisis seven years hence. Steven Holmes of the New York Times, in 1999, reported, “Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest mortgage underwriter, faced mounting pressure from the Clinton Administration to extend mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income individuals, and felt the pressure of shareholders to maintain its extraordinary profit growth.”\n\nHolmes accurately prophesied the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may face trouble in an economic downturn, necessitating a government bailout akin to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As expounded in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, imprudent lending would indeed precipitate an economic meltdown.\n\nNumerous factors conspired to plunge the economy into disarray, one of which was the evolving nature of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were extensively employed in the years preceding the crisis, further entangling various sectors of the economy in the housing market. This led to U.S. households and financial markets to become excessively leveraged in the housing sector, making them highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations.\n\nIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities found themselves in dire straits. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debts in 2007, which constituted approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. Ultimately, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at a steep discount, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were compelled to convert into commercial banks subject to stringent regulation. Fannie and Freddie, saddled with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",

Dr. Merlin, herself, has been known to let out a few choice expletives when she finds herself stuck in a quagmire of info overload, the kind that's not fun or engaging.\n\nExposition, dear reader, is not your ally.\n\nYou're already aware of the fundamental rule of writing, \"Show, Don't Tell.\" Yet, Dr. Merlin still finds herself tripping over long, unyielding paragraphs where nothing of consequence happens, or worse, too much. It's that little voice in your head urging you to get the background out of the way to get to the good stuff, not to be confused with the other voice whispering that you should share every last detail of your characters' backstories.\n\nExposition is the act of relaying information to the audience, typically in straightforward prose. In movies, it's that scene where a character dumps a massive amount of information on another character, like a monologue from the \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In fiction, it's the author doing the telling.\n\nConsider this: As you're reading a tale, you're told about a heroine's love story. She met her beloved at a certain place and time, theymarried in a grand ceremony, and her husband was murdered right in front of her. You wouldn't expect this sequence to take up two whole pages, with both characters only uttering a couple of lines of dialogue each. You'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, showing his love for the heroine through words and actions, and she, in turn, would demonstrate how his presence transformed her life in big and small ways. A proper introduction to the husband's character would make you feel his loss deeply and give you insight into the heroine's thoughts, beliefs, and dreams as seen through his eyes. You'd mourn his death with her, and thus become more invested in her story.\n\nIn other words, you'd expect substance, not just a bare-bones narrative: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you must provide that substance. Sometimes, it's tempting to rush past certain details. Perhaps you're introducing a new character, and you know he used to be in the military, now works at a gas station, has been married twice, no children, enjoys fishing on weekends, and secretly dreams of owning the gas station sometime. You'd want to show these details, not just state them.",
            "In two broadcast updates from Columbus, Ohio, an NBC 4 morning segment (August 13, 2011) led with a developing incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was arrested for stabbing his spouse; his mug shot was aired, depicting a menacing demeanor. The piece ran briefly, about two minutes, given the fluid nature of the situation.\n\nA separate morning update highlighted a shooting in the Sharon Woods area, involving a young man named Travis Buyers, who was critically injured. Authorities were investigating; no arrests had been made. This story was concise, a pattern I've noticed with minority victims, often receiving less attention than their white counterparts. This lack of coverage is a consistent issue.\n\nThe broadcast also touched on a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter, likely caused by a .22 caliber rifle. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nAn upcoming weather forecast for the weekend was brief, mentioning afternoon thunderstorms and highs in the mid-to-low eighties. This segment was short, perhaps to pique interest for future updates.\n\nA robbery at a Clime Road UDF store featured a black man, who was dark-skinned and approximately six feet tall, weighing about 150 pounds. The report seemed to emphasize his race, which I found unnecessary.\n\nAn additional story detailed Rene Rodriguez, a Hispanic former drug kingpin convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio. While he was sentenced to 300 months, the report noted his ethnicity, which seemed irrelevant.",
            "The connection between siblings is profound, a tether that neither time nor distance can sever. Among its many facets are sentiments like affection, admiration, envy, and spite. Siblings understand each other in ways that others never could, seeing in their brother's eyes a reflection of their own soul. These emotions are most vividly displayed in times of crisis, whether good or ill. When these feelings are laid bare, they come with a price. Part of comprehending the emotional ties of this familial bond is grappling with their repercussions. When one gazes into their brother's eyes, they see not the world's perception of them, but their true self. Their actions and the outcomes of those actions reveal their genuine character. In the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" two brothers delve into this theme, along with the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. In a setting rich with vivid description, these two boys embark on an ill-fated journey. Disappointment and pride clash in the story's climax, and only one brother survives. The theme is conveyed through the protagonist's direct portrayal and his interactions with his brother, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which communicates the protagonist's intricate feelings and his view of the world, both of which significantly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are fueled by a singular emotion: pride. From their first outing together to their final, fateful journey, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his little brother, Doodle. He envisioned a brother with whom he could share his skills, like holding his breath, running, jumping, or climbing vines in Old Woman Swamp. He dreamed of a brother to race to Horsehead Landing with and to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn. Unfortunately, these aspirations were dashed by Doodle's frail heart. The young protagonist was filled with wild fantasies, only to have them shattered in a moment. He even contemplated harming the small child, considering suffocating him with a pillow. Yet, his heart softened when Doodle merely smiled at him. This display of love was a testament to the protagonist's true feelings, despite his initial thoughts of infanticide. Deep down, he cared for his brother.",
            "The neural matrix, a complex, imaginative data-processing system, has seen its descriptive analogies evolve with technological progress. Initially likened to a wax tablet, then to a scroll, followed by a tome, and lately, to a digital device, these metaphors, while useful, have limitations and can mislead. As your exploration of the brain unfolds, remember the restricted utility of these analogies and their potential pitfalls.\nSensory organs convert physical stimuli, like touch, warmth, sound waves, or light particles, into electrochemical signals, initiating information intake. The brain then continuously converts this data, employing both bottom-up and top-down processing methods. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing combines basic details such as color, orientation, and border positions to infer a box. Top-down processing, leveraging earlier decisions from the bottom-up process, accelerates the recognition of the object as a black box versus a box-like void in the white backdrop.\nAn attentional gate subsequently determines the significance of the signal and the cognitive processes it should engage. In a grass-filled field, your brain processes every blade, yet an efficient attentional gate prevents individual perception unless the signal is deemed noteworthy, like your name in a noisy environment. This process occurs in multiple stages, with the results continuously shaped by attention.\nInformation processing necessitates storage. Various memory types exist, including sensory, working, and long-term. Encoding varies based on the type of stimulus. Verbal input, for instance, can be structured, referring to visual form, phonemic, relating to sound, or semantic, signifying meaning. Once stored, information must be sustained. Working memory, lasting around 20 seconds, is thought to be maintained by an electrical signal looping through specific neurons. Long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained structurally via certain proteins.\nMultiple theories describe how knowledge is organized in the brain, drawing from subjects' memory retrieval, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network theory posits nodes representing concepts, linked based on their relevance. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" connects to \"table,\" which can link to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley takes aim at the looming perils of technology and capitalism in his dystopian novel, Brave New World. In this society, collective welfare trumps individuality, and citizens are indoctrinated from birth to prioritize immediate contentment. The populace serves as mere cogs in a larger machine, bound by the World Controller's dictates. Through the lens of Marxist ideology, one discerns Huxley's reservations concerning the burgeoning economic systems of his time. Concepts like homogeneity and reification are evident in his critique, implying that the novel is a commentary on the shortcomings of the emerging capitalist economy.\n\n Capitalism is lampooned through the Marxist concept of false consciousness. The common folk are kept in the dark about their true economic ties to other classes, fixated instead on personal gain. This is achieved through the ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, a tactic employed in Brave New World. The populace, divided into classes such as Delta and Gamma, have no genuine agency, their desires for consumption and indulgence amplified through hypnopædia. This manipulation is evident in the World Controller's influence. The idea of hegemony, where social classes are dominated by a separate group, is clearly present. The lower classes are oblivious to this manipulation, 'buying into' the ideology that supports capitalism and consumerism. The upper classes, though capable of understanding, often accept their status. Characters like Bernard exemplify this, with few Alphas and Betas doing more than contentedly accepting their role. The interactions between social classes underscore the perceived oppression of capitalism.\n\nThe novel presents a world where meaningful relationships are absent. Characters, even major ones, lack depth. Perhaps Huxley implies that the confluence of technology and capitalism stifles free will and expression. Love and intense emotions are nonexistent, replaced by superficial interactions. Men comment on women primarily in terms of their physical attributes, while women discuss their encounters flippantly. Each class' willingness to accept their place in the hierarchy mirrors the socioeconomic impact of capitalism. Their unquestioning obedience suggests a proletariat mindset, content with their superior status so long as they continue to consume and conform.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for approximately two and a half years, or roughly four and a half semesters. Like many, navigating campus can be challenging. My freshman year, I was assigned to an East Halls dorm room, located quite far eastward, save for the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Walking from Stuart Hall to distant locations like the Willard Building, near the campus core, could take up to 25 minutes, particularly on inclement days, which are frequent in State College. An alumni, only slightly older than me, shared that East Halls was once isolated by expansive, unused land. Now, that empty space has been transformed into sports fields, new buildings including the Creamery and Health Services, and surrounding apartment complexes. As campus growth continues, travel between points becomes increasingly cumbersome. A feasible solution? Bicycles! However, merely having bikes won't suffice. Students must use them, and campuses must accommodate them.\n\nMy friend recently resumed cycling after a break and commented, \"Bikes are fantastic – they're the best way to commute. For a while, it wasn't popular to ride, but it's the most efficient mode of transportation.\" Bicycling is not only beneficial for health but also the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and some exertion can cover 30 miles or more. I now live off-campus, as distant from the center as some dorms. The wisest decision this year was investing in a bike. My classes in Thomas Building, a 25-minute walk from home, can take just 5 minutes by bike, if pedaled quickly. The main issue is Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas, which isn't always easy to traverse. Walking is a valid option, but my schedule's too busy for that. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable transport. Walking to Thomas daily would add 30-40 minutes to my day, roughly 2.5 hours weekly, plus extra time for other classes, appointments, etc."
