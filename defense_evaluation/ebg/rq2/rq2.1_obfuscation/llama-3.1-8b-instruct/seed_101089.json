            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I embark on a journey to pursue a degree in social work, I envision a career path that aligns with the mission of the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a meaningful impact in the lives of children who have been subjected to abuse or neglect. My professional values include dedication to service, respect for individuals, a strong commitment to ethics, and a relentless pursuit of personal and professional growth to ensure excellence in my field. These core values not only reflect the principles of social work but also resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have always been driven by a desire to make a positive difference in the lives of others. However, I was initially uncertain about the career path that would allow me to achieve this goal. My experiences in high school and college exposed me to individuals who struggled with various challenges, and I witnessed firsthand the importance of effective coping mechanisms. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a deliberate break to reflect on my career aspirations. It was during this time that I had an epiphany. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was dealing with a difficult home situation. His story had a profound impact on me, and I felt compelled to take action. I reached out to the authorities and offered my support, leveraging my degree in Psychology to help address the situation. The experience marked a turning point for me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work, which would enable me to make a tangible difference in the lives of children and families.\n\nIn addition to service, social justice is another value that drives me to pursue a career in social work. As a society, we often emphasize the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to societal norms. I believe that this dichotomy is a reflection of our desire to be part of a larger collective, rather than embracing our unique characteristics. Throughout my academic and personal journey, I have consistently sought to challenge social norms and promote inclusivity. I have expressed my individuality through self-expression, participating in various extracurricular activities and causes that align with my values, such as advocating for social justice and equality.",
            "This paper delves into the dual perspectives of biological and sociocultural factors contributing to the complex issue of insomnia. The biological model delves into the genetic underpinnings of sleep disorders, encompassing heritable traits and physiological aspects that impact sleep patterns. Conversely, the sociocultural model explores environmental relationships and their influence on sleep, taking into account demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographics.\n\nInsomnia can manifest as a primary sleep disorder, a comorbid condition with a mental health disorder, or a disorder precipitated by medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, with Dyssonmias encompassing Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other related conditions. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, marked by cataplexy and automatic REM sleep, is a distinct entity within this category. In contrast, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral or physiological abnormalities, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders is centered on the role of genetics, inherited factors, and the physiological mechanisms governing sleep-wake cycles. Research has identified key neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, which regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are crucial for modulating sleep-wake states. The activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and facilitate sleep. Furthermore, a GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor could compromise an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as the heritability of the phenotype could influence sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities.",
            "Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a complex condition that affects the brain's ability to process auditory information. This disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the inefficient transmission of auditory signals to the brain, resulting in difficulties with sound perception and processing. In essence, individuals with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain struggles to interpret and make sense of the auditory information. This distinction is crucial, as it differentiates CAPD from hearing impairments, which involve the physical inability to perceive sounds.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the early 1950s, when researchers first identified the disorder as \"auditory imperception.\" Subsequent studies by Italian researchers, led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, laid the groundwork for the development of tests to assess auditory processing in children with communicative disorders. The introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961 further advanced our understanding of the physiological basis of auditory processing. A national conference convened in 1977 sparked a surge in research focused on CAPD, paving the way for the development of diagnostic tools and treatments.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, acoustic event discrimination, sound pattern recognition, speech differentiation, and sound synthesis. Individuals with CAPD may also struggle to sequence auditory information, leading to challenges with auditory processing. Other common symptoms include sound blocking, where a subsequent sound obscures the preceding one, and the inability to differentiate changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm through changes in tone.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's auditory function, which may include systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory tests administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals. While no single test or tool is universally accepted as a diagnostic gold standard, a range of measures are used to assess auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The use of disguise as a means of deception in Twelfth Night raises intriguing questions about the consequences of adopting a new persona. On one hand, the adoption of a disguise can facilitate deception and allow individuals to navigate complex social situations, but it also risks leading to a loss of one's true identity. The difficulty of ending a deception is further complicated by the possibility of alienation, as others may respond with offense or disinterest upon discovering the truth.\n\nThe theme of deception in the context of gender role reversal is particularly fraught, as it highlights the underlying motivations behind adopting a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to assume the identity of a man is driven by a desire for self-preservation, as she seeks to protect herself from potential threats in a foreign land. However, this decision comes at a cost, as it isolates her from her support network and creates complications in her relationships with others.\n\nThe dynamics between Viola, Olivia, and Orsino are complex and multifaceted. Olivia's confusion of Viola with Sebastian and her subsequent romantic feelings for Cesario raise questions about the nature of attraction and desire. One interpretation is that the appearance of Cesario forces Olivia to confront her own suppressed emotions, but this reading is complicated by the fact that Olivia's affections seem to shift easily, suggesting that her feelings may be driven by superficial characteristics rather than deeper emotional connections.\n\nThis nuance is underscored by Olivia's later characterization of Viola as a sister, which suggests that her earlier romantic feelings for Cesario were perhaps superficial or misguided. The play thus raises questions about the complexities of human relationships and the ways in which we navigate our emotions and desires.\n\nUltimately, Twelfth Night presents a rich and thought-provoking exploration of the human experience, one that challenges readers to consider the consequences of deception, the complexity of identity, and the nature of human relationships.",
            "The German colonial administration has been characterized by its starkly differing approaches to governance, with certain colonies exhibiting notably harsh treatment of indigenous populations. The Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa are a striking example of this, with widespread accounts of genocide and brutality. However, it would be inaccurate to generalize the entire colonial empire's policies based on a single instance. The German colonial administration's policies and approaches varied significantly across the colonies, mirroring the region's diverse geography.\n\nEducation provision, in particular, demonstrated considerable variation across the colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (now known as Tanzania) in 1919, they found an educated and literate indigenous population, with some praising the German efforts in this regard. Conversely, German colonial policies in Kamerun and other territories received similarly positive commentary from contemporaries.\n\nSouth West Africa, now Namibia, presented a stark contrast to East Africa. In the latter, the government played a pivotal role in establishing state schools and providing education to the local population. In contrast, the responsibility for educating native populations in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies, which received limited support from the government. The administration, however, invested substantial resources in educating the European population, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions. The educational policies implemented in South West Africa had lasting effects on the colony, persisting even after German rule. Conversely, other German colonies witnessed significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic elements, contributed to the divergent experiences of South West Africa.\n\nThis investigation aims to build upon existing research by examining the underlying factors that led to this divergence, with particular emphasis on recent studies examining the views of settlers and colonial authorities on indigenous populations. \n\nA substantial body of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, with a significant portion of this literature written in German and produced during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in individual colonies. Later studies written in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education across various colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa offers a comprehensive comparison of the two colonies' educational systems and identifies key factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the presence of a substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the colony's distinct characteristics.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, despite the prevalence of arid desert terrain. This environment attracted a larger European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to approximately 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The evolution of popular music has led to a proliferation of genres over the past century, making it a daunting task to compile an exhaustive list. Furthermore, numerous sub-genres have branched out from the primary categories of rock, jazz, folk, and country, rendering the musical landscape increasingly complex. Among these, the heavy metal sub-genre has emerged as a particularly dynamic and expressive force, with a propensity for conveying a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nThe diversity of heavy metal is evident in its adaptability, as artists began to experiment and push the boundaries of the genre from its inception. This fluidity has given rise to a multitude of sub-genres, each with its unique characteristics, resulting in a rich tapestry of sounds. The proliferation of niches within the heavy metal movement has reached a point where defining the genre has become a challenging endeavor.\n\nTo grasp the essence of contemporary metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the underlying principles that drive its evolution. Heavy metal can be seen as a movement characterized by its affinity for the darker aspects of human experience. Musically, this is manifested through an emphasis on volume, intensity, and technical proficiency, often accompanied by theatricality and a sense of chaos. Lyrically, heavy metal often explores themes of darkness, introspection, and the human condition, often drawing from literary and philosophical influences.\n\nThe roots of heavy metal can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s, when psychedelic rock and the counterculture movement fostered a climate of experimentation and innovation. The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, exemplifies this spirit of pushing boundaries and exploring the darker aspects of human experience. Written in response to the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" \"Helter Skelter\" demonstrated the Beatles' willingness to confront the heavier and more aggressive side of rock music, paving the way for the development of the heavy metal genre.",
            "In the years preceding the Surrealist art movement, an innovative artist was quietly weaving his own brand of reality, both literally and figuratively. Henri Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only showcases a woman captivated by the wonders of a fantastical realm but also serves as a poignant reflection of the artist's own aspirations and inner turmoil. Having longed for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers, Rousseau grappled with a profound internal conflict – to conform to the conventions of his time or to forge his own unique path, unencumbered by the expectations of the art world he admired.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream within this context, one must first delve into the life and experiences that shaped Rousseau's artistic vision. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau came from a family that enjoyed a comfortable upper-class existence. His father operated a successful business, which provided him with a relatively stable upbringing. Despite the absence of formal artistic training, Rousseau spent over two decades employed in a mundane job with the municipal toll service, earning him the colloquial nickname \"douanier\" – a customs inspector – although his official title was gabelou. The untimely death of his first wife and eight infant children left Rousseau heartbroken, with only his daughter Julia remaining. This loss marked a turning point in his life, prompting him to seek solace in painting as a means of escape and renewal. Unlike his contemporaries, who often idolized and romanticized the peasantry, Rousseau drew inspiration from the experiences and aspirations of the common man.\n\nGiven his unorthodox background and the fact that he began his artistic journey at an advanced age, Rousseau's desire for recognition in the art world is understandable. He produced his works alongside some of the most renowned artists of his time, including Henri Matisse, who was just beginning to establish himself as a prominent figure in the art world. According to Jan Gordon's account in Modern French Painters, the two artists, while technically rivals, differed in their motivations and artistic visions. While Matisse sought to avoid the mundane and trite, Rousseau aimed to create works that were so conventional that they would be acknowledged by the French art establishment.",
            "Philosophers have long debated the connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are deeply intertwined. I propose that there is a fundamental reason for this association. The poet John Keats' famous phrase in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" encapsulates this idea: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding of the world comes from education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional means of acquisition. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate, the nature of right and wrong, or what makes a work beautiful.\n\nMore specifically, critiques of art and morality often struggle to capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. In discussions of art, such as those surrounding Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may focus on technical aspects like composition, context, or cultural significance, but these elements only scratch the surface. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often express that there's something intangible that sets it apart. I believe that art and morals share this elusive quality, which cannot be fully reduced to a description of their characteristics. As writer Flannery O'Connor noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics and aesthetics possess a transcendent dimension that cannot be captured by analysis.\n\nWittgenstein's assertion that \"ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental\" underscores the inexpressible nature of ethics. I propose that this transcendent aspect is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and serves as a common thread connecting them. \n\nI also believe that the relationship between ethics and aesthetics is rooted in their shared capacity to evoke a profound, yet inexplicable, sense of connection. This phenomenon is most pronounced in literature, as McKean suggests: \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern identity is characterized by its robust cultural landscape, a harmonious blend of influences stretching from the picturesque Alpine region around Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This rich cultural tapestry is also evident in Köln, situated on the Rhine River, and extends through the heart of the country to Dresden, a city nestled on the banks of the Elbe. Given its unique cultural heritage, it is hardly surprising that Germany's modern identity has evolved from a complex interplay of various historical sources and tribes.\n\nThe origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in debate among scholars and historians. Some attribute the name to the Tungrian tribe, which, according to Tacitus, was known as the Germans prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in battles with Gaulish forces (Tacitus, circa 98 CE). Alternatively, Julius Caesar's writings on the Gallic Wars (50-40 BC) suggest that he derived the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between those they had conquered and those they had not. In his commentary, Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, circa 50-40 BC). Others propose that the term \"German\" may be linked to the Gaulish word for \"neighbor\" or the Old English word \"ger,\" referring to a spear used in warfare. The term could also be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might imply that the Germans were known for their loud or boisterous nature (Oxford English Dictionary, 2010).\n\nTacitus' work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (circa 98 CE) offers valuable insights into the origins of the Germanic tribes. In it, he writes: \"I would regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse... Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany with its harsh climate, rugged terrain, and stern demeanor, unless it were their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, circa 98 CE). This perception of Germania as a land shunned by outsiders is reinforced by the Roman Empire's historical reluctance to colonize the region. While the Romans did venture into Germanic territories, they often returned to their empire, and the Germanic tribes maintained their independence, interacting with the Romans primarily through trade and military service (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "As I stood there, my gaze fell upon the scene before me, my mind processing the details without engaging in any emotional response. My thoughts fluttered in and out of my consciousness like leaves on a breeze, each one vanishing as quickly as it appeared. My mental state was a fluid, effortless experience, unencumbered by personal interpretations or biases.\n\nI had long been fascinated by the creative process, and as a child, I often dreamed of becoming an artist. Years ago, I had stumbled upon a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" which offered a unique approach to understanding the artistic process. The book outlined various techniques, including the use of a mental frame to simplify complex subjects. By placing a square boundary around a scene, the artist could focus on the essence of the image, stripping away extraneous details.\n\nAs I stood there, staring at the unassuming pile of waste before me, I couldn't help but think of this technique. The artist's frame seemed to elude me, however, and I found myself overwhelmed by the sheer mundane nature of the scene. The flush of memories from my art class came flooding back – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, and the vibrant colors of the Italian Renaissance masters. I had always aspired to create something beautiful, something worthy of being called art. In that moment, I felt a spark of inspiration, a sense that I was on the cusp of something creative.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the toilet handle, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to begin. The water swirled and churned, a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of my heart. I felt a sense of calm wash over me as I gazed down at the offending mass before me. My hand tightened its grip on the handle, and with a gentle motion, I began to work. The water continued to flow, a soothing serenade that accompanied my creative process.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, my thoughts turned to the task at hand. I stood tall, my feet shoulder-width apart, my grip on the toilet handle steady. My eyes never left the target, my focus unwavering. The water continued to flow, a relentless, calming force that seemed to carry away my doubts and fears. And then, with a quiet determination, I reached for the toilet paper roll, my hand wrapping around it like a grasp of a lifeline. The next few moments were a blur of movement and sound, a symphony of action and purpose.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage driving fatalities is a pressing concern that warrants attention and reform.  A multitude of factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  Research indicates that the adolescent brain is still maturing and lacks the necessary sophistication to navigate the complexities of driving.  Furthermore, inexperience plays a significant role in the high number of fatalities and accidents involving teenagers.  This inexperience is not only linked to a higher incidence of fatal crashes but also an increased likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt is also worth noting that teenagers tend to fare poorly when driving with their peers, a demographic often found in most driving situations.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlighted a significant correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response to this issue, several states have implemented measures to enhance teen driver safety, including provisional licenses with restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits.  However, these measures are merely temporary solutions and do not address the root cause of the problem.  As a group, young drivers are statistically less equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that the desire for thrill-seeking behavior is particularly prevalent among individuals under the age of 20.  This, coupled with the fact that many of these young drivers are still developing physically and cognitively, makes a strong case for delaying full licensure until the individual has matured further.  If we continue to issue unrestricted driver's licenses to teenagers, the number of fatalities is likely to continue to rise, with devastating consequences.\n\nA more effective approach would be to establish a uniform national standard that prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from operating a motor vehicle.  Schools could continue to provide driver education classes, and a provisional permit could be issued prior to granting a full driver's license, with a requirement for a certain number of supervised driving hours.  This could be modeled after existing state guidelines, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  By implementing a nationwide policy, we can better protect teen drivers across the country.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but rather a response to a pressing issue that requires a unified approach.  By taking a proactive stance, we can reduce the number of teen driving fatalities and create a safer road environment for all.",
            "During an expedition through the extensive film archives at the Library of Congress, I came across a collection of early Edison films, specifically those categorized as trick films, which spanned from 1895 to 1901. A total of fifteen films fell under this category, each showcasing the innovative use of editing techniques to create illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic qualities of the majority of these trick films, as well as identifying distinct deviations from typical conventions in a few later productions. The prevailing style of trick films at the turn of the century was characterized by its confinement to a set-bound, frontal proscenium, static camera, and reliance on long and medium shots, adhering to a strict one-shot-per-film approach. However, there were a few exceptions among early 20th-century trick films that dared to challenge these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking commonalities among trick films is their predilection for filming within a confined interior set, adhering to the traditional frontal proscenium structure. The camera remained stationary, never deviating from its fixed position to follow characters or objects. This composition drew inspiration from the theatre and, in the case of trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. A notable limitation inherent in this approach was the restriction of character movement to side-to-side motions, with minimal or no forward or backward movement towards the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side and moved horizontally, with the camera remaining steadfast in its position.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also dictated that shots predominantly consisted of long shots, with occasional medium shots. Close-ups were virtually nonexistent in the Edison catalog's trick films, a trait borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience would view the entire performance within the framed stage. In most early films, characters rarely moved towards the camera, thereby precluding the use of close-ups. The prevailing convention that one conceptual shot equated to one film led to a typical runtime of about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This constraint limited the narrative and dramatic potential of trick films, which mostly focused on concise, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching performances with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that a single \"shot\" in a trick film can actually comprise multiple joined shots, cleverly designed to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. A prime example of this can be seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, where a closer examination reveals the exact moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" commences, despite the film's conceptual unity as one shot in the viewer's perception.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a pioneering figure in the early American republic, was a steadfast advocate for limited government and the preservation of individual liberties. As a farmer and a politician, he was deeply committed to the values of agrarianism, which informed his views on governance and the role of the state. His unwavering dedication to the principles of self-sufficiency and rural life influenced his stance on issues of sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a system of government that would prioritize the rights and freedoms of its citizens. He was a strong proponent of the idea that natural rights are inherent and inalienable, and that their deprivation would have far-reaching consequences for the entire social fabric. In his view, the \"state of nature\" – a concept he often invoked to describe the primordial human condition – was characterized by the dominance of the strong over the weak, but he saw this as a scenario that should be mitigated in a civilized society.\n\nTo create a more just and equitable society, Taylor argued that a government must be designed to balance the inherent duality of human nature, acknowledging both its capacity for good and its propensity for evil. He was a firm believer in the idea that government, being a human institution, is susceptible to the same vices and virtues as its citizens. According to Taylor, a government founded on good principles would prioritize the protection of private property, the advancement of agriculture, and the regulation of capitalism, thereby ensuring a more equitable distribution of wealth and power.\n\nTaylor's understanding of human nature led him to conclude that self-interest was a fundamental driving force behind human behavior, but he distinguished between self-interest that serves the common good and that which exploits others. A good government, in his opinion, should strive to harness self-interest in the service of the greater good, while also monitoring its own influence to prevent the introduction of corrupting principles.\n\nIn line with his commitment to limited government, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, which he believed should be interpreted in a literal and uncompromising manner. He was wary of expansive federal power, which he saw as a threat to individual liberties and a recipe for despotism. However, he also recognized the importance of considering the intent behind the Constitution's framers, lest a simplistic interpretation lead to abuse and corruption. Moreover, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the foundational document of the United States, as it more explicitly enshrined the principles of sovereignty and the rights of the people.",
            "Upon examining the data in Figure 17, a notable decrease in commuter log submissions becomes apparent during the third month of the project. This decline, while disappointing, is somewhat understandable, particularly when considering the seasonal factors that may have influenced participation. As winter sets in at our New England campus, there is a natural decrease in bicycle and pedestrian traffic, which could account for a portion of the drop. Additionally, the end of the fall semester and the ensuing busy holiday season may have led to a decrease in overall campus activity, resulting in commuter logs slipping down the priority list for many individuals. Furthermore, the month-long break during the holidays may have reduced the need for students and faculty to physically attend campus, thus reducing the incentive to log their commutes.\n\nIt is also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project led to an initial surge in participation, which naturally tapered off over time. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week, a targeted campaign in March designed to reinvigorate the initiative and boost log submissions, which ultimately succeeded in achieving this goal.\n\nOne of the key challenges we faced in maintaining project momentum was the inherent difficulty of combating the natural decrease in engagement that occurs during periods of seasonal and academic transition. Furthermore, the cultural preference for driving personal vehicles poses a significant obstacle to alternative commuting initiatives. To mitigate this, we introduced incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed to be effective in encouraging participation. However, it is intriguing to consider whether larger, more substantial prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, may have had an even greater impact on participation. By increasing the value of prizes over time, we may have been able to sustain engagement levels and avoid the decline experienced during the project. The consistency of our incentive structure, while effective initially, may not have been enough to counteract the decline in participation, particularly during the holiday season.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) offers investors a unique hybrid model, combining the diversification benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a single stock. Like its index fund counterpart, an ETF allows investors to tap into a broad market segment, but its exchange-listed status enables buyers to purchase and sell shares like individual stocks. This flexibility comes with several attractive benefits, including the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and acquire as few as one share in a transaction. A key advantage of ETFs over mutual funds lies in their significantly lower expense ratios. However, this convenience comes at a cost, as investors incur trading commissions on ETF transactions, just like those associated with individual stock trades.\n\nETFs boast an extensive array of investment options, catering to diverse investor preferences. Nevertheless, astute investors must critically evaluate the touted benefits, such as diversification, to determine their actual value and extent. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, comprising 63.58% of its total assets, to assess whether a single ETF can provide comparable benefits to a diversified portfolio of the constituent stocks, and whether an alternative configuration might yield a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we have selected the top 10 holdings, which collectively represent the majority of the ETF's assets. By using the current asset allocation as a basis, we can estimate the contributions of each stock to a hypothetical portfolio's risk and return, should it consist entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The accompanying chart provides the calculated Beta and return values for the top 10 holdings.\n\nA cursory examination of the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Notably, the Beta of this hypothetical portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with reduced volatility. However, it is essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo investigate this further, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation. This analysis will help determine whether the performance differences between the ETF and its top 10 holdings are statistically distinguishable.",
            "The poem \"Dream-Land\" is notable for its unique incorporation of the term \"Thulé,\" a concept that has its roots in the works of Virgil. However, an often-overlooked precursor to Virgil's use of the term can be found in the writings of Karl J. Arndt, who explores the shared literary influences between Edgar Allan Poe and Goethe in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon.\" Arndt's analysis highlights a possible case of literary borrowing, where Poe draws inspiration from Goethe's works.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a prominent literary figure, renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832. Within \"Faust,\" a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" presents a narrative of a king whose wife's passing sets him on a path of tragic introspection. This poem, which explores themes of grief and mortality, bears a striking resemblance to Poe's depiction of a desolate Thulé in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nIn \"The King of Thulé,\" the monarch's descent into despair is precipitated by the loss of his wife, a theme that echoes in Poe's own work. The narrative of the king's downfall, marked by his excessive drinking and eventual demise, serves as a poignant commentary on the human experience. Interestingly, the similarities between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible connection between the two poems, with the latter serving as a dark mirror to the former.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in multiple works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" underscores his familiarity with Goethe's writing. The fact that Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" as bookends adds weight to the idea that these poems are interconnected. A closer reading of \"Dream-Land\" reveals a landscape of desolation and loss, which is strikingly reminiscent of the king's experience in \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it is likely that he was well-versed in Goethe's work. While this connection is not direct, it is clear that Poe was influenced by Goethe's writing, as evident in the numerous reproductions of Goethe's work that were circulating during Poe's time. The interplay between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" serves as a testament to the power of literary borrowing and the enduring influence of great works on subsequent writers.",
            "Under the jurisdiction of California law, a customer who suffered an injury after slipping and falling on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store may potentially be awarded punitive damages if they can demonstrate that the store manager's actions displayed a reckless disregard for the potential risks associated with the situation.\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages without further consideration. In order to establish a valid claim for punitive damages, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a deliberate and wanton disregard for the potential harm that could arise from their conduct. Furthermore, they must also show that the defendant's behavior was egregious or despicable.\n\nPalmer may argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given the history of multiple slip-and-fall incidents at D&D Markets in the months leading up to Palmer's accident. Despite this knowledge, Martin chose not to address the issue. Additionally, Palmer may point to the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, and Martin did not take adequate steps to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about a spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on a break and could not attend to customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, but he gave the same response. Thirty minutes after the initial report, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining the possibility of filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that does not arise from a contractual agreement if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it involves a deliberate disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant is aware of the potential risks associated with their actions and deliberately chooses to ignore them, leading to harm.",
            "Approximately four years ago, I had the opportunity to explore the complexities of Islam through a course at CBC.  One of the most contentious topics we discussed in the class was the notion of Islam as a potentially hostile faith.  In light of the events that have transpired since 9/11, I believe this question is more pertinent than ever.  Observing the shift in the media's portrayal of Islam and extremism has been striking.  In 2001, a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has a Muslim heritage, would have been unimaginable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a subject that continues to fascinate me.  My understanding of his history, as gleaned from various accounts, reveals a paradoxical figure.  I once believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam through conquest and coercion, but the biography presents a more nuanced portrayal – that of a misunderstood and humbled individual who inspired people to seek him out.  This dichotomy has left me with a multitude of questions about the Prophet's true nature.\n\nNotably, there are intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the reported miracles of Muhammad.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying food to feed a group of forty men.  This style of storytelling has led me to wonder if the writers intended to convey Muhammad as a humble, self-effacing figure who required no proof, but rather lived a life of truth and wonder.  This narrative approach has a profound impact on my perception of the story, as it subtly downplays the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous anecdotes that appear to serve as testimonials to the validity of Islam.  However, I find it problematic that many of these accounts are secondhand, passed down through multiple individuals.  The intention behind these stories may be to provide evidence of the truth, but it ultimately undermines their credibility, making them seem suspicious and lacking in authenticity.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a virtuous, compassionate, and wise individual.  Historical records, however, cast doubt on this characterization, and I am left wondering if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and convictions of Jesus, as well as the beliefs he advocated for during his lifetime, have been largely overlooked in the development of Christian thought that emerged after his passing.  From a broader historical perspective, it is evident that Christianity has gradually drifted further away from its origins over time.  As we navigate the complexities of today's world, an increased awareness and a trend towards progressive thinking are becoming increasingly apparent.  While those who adhere to traditional values and resist any deviation from established doctrine will undoubtedly continue to exist, their numbers may ultimately prove insufficient to significantly influence the broader trajectory of the faith.  In the years to come, a growing awareness of history among Christians will likely lead to a heightened desire to distinguish between the core principles of the faith and the additional ideas and dogma that have accumulated over time.  This process may take several generations or even centuries, but the eventual outcome is unavoidable: Christianity will undergo a significant reversal, gradually returning to its original form.  A movement will likely gain momentum, shedding the layers of doctrine that have accumulated over time, much like a clock rewinding itself, until only the fundamental principles imparted by Jesus remain.  As this trend takes hold in the United States and Europe, it will influence large numbers of people, leading to a return to a simpler, more authentic form of worship, one that closely resembles the faith as Jesus knew it.  The institution of the church will continue to play a significant role in guiding this process.  However, this reversal will also result in a decrease in the diversity of Christian thought and practice, as the theological clock unwinds, leading to a more uniform understanding of the faith.  Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and other divisions, we will witness an increasing convergence of beliefs and practices.  Human history is replete with examples of such reversals.  For instance, the Roman Empire, once hostile to Christianity, eventually became a bastion of the faith.  Similarly, the United States has undergone a significant shift from racism and oppression to greater inclusivity and equality.  In the future, Christianity will experience a similar reversion, one that will involve a return to the source of the faith and a reduction in diversity.  It is essential to note that one key factor that will facilitate this process is the reevaluation of Jesus' words as metaphorical and not literal statements of fact.  In order to understand the evolution of Christianity, we must look back to its earliest roots.  If we examine the historical record, we find that, prior to Jesus' lifetime, the Jewish faith was the primary theological influence behind Christianity.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core tenets of Judaism, including monotheism, a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were well-established.  However, the Jewish population was not united, with various groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people existing side by side.",
            "One of the primary concerns expressed in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle revolves around the innate self-interest of human beings. It is argued that deep down, individuals primarily focus on bettering their own lives and overlook the well-being of those less fortunate. This theme is demonstrated through various characters and settings in the novel. \n\nOn one hand, factory owners and managers exemplify this self-interest, striving to expand their businesses without regard for the consequences. The narrative highlights the damaging effects of their relentless pursuit of progress. Sinclair vividly describes the pollution caused by the factories, underscoring the owners' disregard for the environment and the people affected by it. The image of the smoke-filled atmosphere and the overwhelming pollution showcases the devastating impact of their actions.\n\nMoreover, the owners and managers care little for their employees, treating them as mere commodities to be exploited for profit. They prioritize profits over people, as seen in the following passage: \"A sense of envy and hostility pervades the entire community, devoid of any loyalty or decency.\" The employees are subjected to grueling working conditions and sudden layoffs, with little to no support or compensation. During the time period depicted in the novel, workers had limited protections, allowing the factory owners to operate with impunity.\n\nThe novel implies that the workers, worn down by their circumstances, were expected to endure the harsh conditions without any assistance. The lack of organizations or agencies providing aid to the working class left them vulnerable. While unions were formed, they often exploited the workers, prioritizing profits over their well-being. The workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and dependence, likened to a system of slavery. As Sinclair writes, \"In this population, mostly foreign and low-income, people are perpetually on the brink of starvation, relying on the whims of men as ruthless as the old slave traders. Under these circumstances, immorality becomes as inevitable and widespread as it was under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In literature, authors often employ various techniques to elicit a particular emotional response from their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby, exemplifies this notion, as he skillfully employs a range of techniques to convey meaning and create a specific atmosphere. One notable technique he uses is the juxtaposition of words to generate a particular connotation. For instance, Fitzgerald frequently combines adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways to create a distinct aura surrounding a subject. He also assigns abstract meanings to symbols and utilizes them to convey these interpretations. This technique is particularly evident in his use of colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops and employs the meanings associated with these colors to create a particular emotional resonance.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color symbolism is a striking example of this technique. He establishes the connotations of white and gray early in the novel, often associating them with concepts such as uniformity, elegance, and age. The former is often linked to refinement and higher social status, while the latter is associated with a sense of wear and familiarity. This interpretation is established through repeated instances of these colors in relation to various characters and settings. For example, Daisy and Jordan are frequently dressed in white, as seen in \"they were dressed in white\" (8), while Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party. Tom, on the other hand, is often depicted wearing a \"white shirt\" (36), while Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The sole exception to this trend is when Nick describes Gatsby's party, where the hall is \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40), emphasizing the stark contrast with the dominant use of white and gray.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying these colors to common, everyday subjects. When Nick commutes to work, he traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and the names on his timetable are written in \"gray\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), exemplifying the uniformity Fitzgerald aims to convey. He also uses these colors to describe ordinary people and places, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" (27) who sells dogs.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of white and gray, Fitzgerald employs these colors to signify a lack of significance or uniformity in the characters. This is particularly evident in his depiction of Daisy. Following a period of minimal use of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them in relation to Daisy, describing her as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74). This portrayal serves to undermine her character, reducing her to a uniform, desired object in Gatsby's eyes. This technique is further reinforced by the use of gray to describe Daisy's fur collar (18) and her appearance in a white dress (115) before the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "The San Diego County area boasts a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant climate. The region's diverse crop selection includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. There is a significant demand for locally sourced, organic produce, with many residents seeking out community-supported agriculture options. This trend has led to a waiting list for some local organizations offering these services. Organic dairy and egg production are also in high demand. Some farms in the area provide guided tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, thereby enabling landowners to benefit from government programs while preserving natural habitats and generating additional revenue streams.\n\nNot only can organic farming fill a lucrative niche market, but it also contributes to increased biodiversity in the region. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water allows for a more diverse range of plant and animal species to thrive. However, organic farming often comes with higher operational costs. For instance, organic farming requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds without the use of synthetic chemicals, and losses can be greater than those experienced with conventional farming methods. Additionally, small-scale organic farms often lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nBeyond the specific practices associated with organic farming, land managers may also implement other beneficial techniques that support local wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotational grazing, invasive species removal, and strategic management of vegetation to create specific habitats or open spaces. These efforts can be resource-intensive and may incur additional labor costs. As a result, a landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profitability and environmental quality.\n\nThe chosen property is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, California, near the town of Potrero. The 160-acre parcel is comprised of a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is currently being considered for inclusion in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan encompasses over a hundred species, including several that are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher, as well as species that are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production during the intervening years.\n\nI selected a property from a real estate listing and researched relevant government programs to explore options for mitigating costs and promoting wildlife-friendly practices. As a model for a local farm, I identified an organic farm in the same area that serves as a potential example of what a landowner in this scenario might strive to achieve.",
            "Effective negotiation often relies on a nuanced understanding of the cultural context in which it takes place. This involves recognizing that culture is a multifaceted and dynamic entity, shaped by a complex interplay of factors. Rather than reducing cultures to simplistic stereotypes, such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating,\" negotiators should strive to grasp the specific cultural nuances that influence decision-making and interactions.\n\nTo achieve this, it's essential to delve beyond broad generalizations and explore the deeper significance of a culture. This may involve studying its history, examining its values and biases, and acknowledging the unique experiences and perspectives that shape its members' interactions. By doing so, negotiators can develop a more empathetic and informed approach, better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural communication.\n\nWhen engaging with unfamiliar cultural contexts, it's natural to draw comparisons with one's own cultural background. However, this can also lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Instead, negotiators should aim to approach each culture with an open mind, suspending assumptions and judgments to appreciate its distinct character. This requires a willingness to adapt and be flexible, particularly when facing a weaker bargaining position or operating in unfamiliar territory.\n\nInterestingly, corporate culture can be a significant aspect of this dynamic, even within a single nation. Companies often develop their unique corporate identity, shaped by factors such as work-life balance, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some organizations prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed atmosphere. Similarly, employee dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic initiatives can all reveal the nuances of a company's culture.\n\nMoreover, values play a crucial role in shaping a culture's underlying dynamics. Understanding the values that drive a culture – such as the importance of saving face, communal harmony, or hard-driving competitiveness – can significantly inform negotiation strategies. By recognizing these values, negotiators can tailor their approach to resonate with their counterpart's cultural context, increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes.\n\nUltimately, effective negotiation requires a deep appreciation for the complexities of cultural differences. By taking the time to understand the underlying values, biases, and nuances of a culture, negotiators can develop a more effective and empathetic approach, better equipped to navigate the challenges of cross-cultural communication.",
            "The notion of divine non-existence has been a subject of debate throughout history. A notable passage encapsulating this concept is found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This assertion is echoed by both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two prominent thinkers whose arguments for the existence of God are the focus of our discussion. To facilitate a meaningful comparison, we will assume that both philosophers are arguing in favor of the God of the Bible, as any alternative conceptions of a divine being would complicate our analysis. While both thinkers present valid points, a closer examination reveals that neither provides a comprehensive foundation for their respective arguments.\n\nTo illustrate this point, we will first examine St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning is based on the idea that understanding of God can be found within the human mind. He posits that the notion of God's non-existence is inconceivable, implying that the existence of God can be deduced through introspection. This approach suggests that empirical evidence is not necessary, as the truth of God's existence is perceived as self-evident. This perspective aligns with the concept of faith, which is often associated with the acceptance of truth that may not be readily verifiable through empirical means.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach, arguing that the existence of God can be proven through reason and evidence alone. This perspective has implications for evangelism, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without reliance on faith, instead using logic as a persuasive tool. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments for the existence of God, each focusing on the inherent necessity of God's existence. He illustrates this point using analogies, such as the missing puzzle piece, where the existence of the missing piece can be inferred through logical reasoning, even if it is not directly observable.",
            "A pivotal figure, later known as the Buddha, emerged during the fifth or sixth century BCE. This individual's transformative journey from a life of worldly attachments to attainment of enlightenment laid the groundwork for the development of Buddhism. As the centuries have passed, the faith has undergone significant evolution, manifesting in diverse forms such as the Theravada tradition, which has taken root in countries like Sri Lanka. There, the annual water-cutting ceremony, though not directly outlined in the teachings of the Buddha, holds spiritual significance for both monastic and lay practitioners. These adaptations, ranging from superficial customs to the fundamental tenants of the doctrine, demonstrate the dynamic nature of the Theravada Buddhist community. The community's evolving principles, influenced by both internal and external forces, have been shaped by a complex interplay of factors.\n\nInternal and external forces, key concepts in this discussion, warrant clarification. An internal force is one that originates from within the Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members. Conversely, external forces arise from non-Buddhist influences. Hostile forces are those that intentionally or unintentionally harm the community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, in contrast, aim to neither harm nor assist the community, although their actions may have unintended consequences. These definitions will be employed throughout this examination.\n\nTo grasp the essence of Theravada Buddhism, it is crucial to explore its foundational doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, comprising the Tripitaka, is comprised of three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, encompassing the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central to these notions are the concepts of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these tenets is essential for transcending Sansara, the cycle of rebirth and death, which perpetuates itself ceaselessly. Enlightenment also brings an end to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a framework for guiding laypeople's lives, including the five precepts (non-harming, honesty, non-stealing, chastity, and sobriety). For monks, a more extensive set of rules governs their behavior. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the Four Noble Truths. Firstly, the truth of suffering (Dukkha); secondly, the truth that attachment leads to suffering; and thirdly, the truth that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The 57-year-long animosity between the United States and Mexico, spanning from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145), exemplifies a classic case of a border nation rivalry. The conflict reached a boiling point during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States emerge victorious and secure significant territorial gains, including Texas and the American Southwest. While the war marked the peak of the rivalry, other clashes between the two nations persisted, finally subsiding in the years leading up to World War I.\n\nA fundamental aspect of this prolonged rivalry stemmed from fundamental differences in values, customs, and traditions, as well as conflicting material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This scenario is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship; many nations sharing borders often experience similar tensions due to divergent interests and priorities. As David M. Pletcher (1977) noted, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-standing American foreign policy challenges\" (p. 41). Geographical proximity has contributed to the enduring nature of these rivalries, particularly in the case of Mexico and Cuba, which have historically been at odds with the US.\n\nThe rift between the two nations was also fueled by religious differences, a common denominator in many historical conflicts. Sally Frahm (2001) observed that, \"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, much like their twentieth-century stance against fascism and communism\" (p. 86). This ideological struggle, however, was not merely a disagreement over political systems but rather a clash of values rooted in religious preferences. The legacy of distrust inherited from their colonial past – the English and Spanish empires – hindered the establishment of harmonious diplomatic relations between the US and Mexico.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period, with the majority centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and frontier conflicts. The problems of banditry and lawlessness along the border were eventually alleviated through increased military presence on both sides (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) attributed the decline of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the US and the shift in American ambitions, which transitioned from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110) in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "It's been a decade and a half since an unforeseen health crisis suddenly derailed my life's trajectory. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career choice driven by my childhood experiences of uncertainty and insecurity. The message that resonated with me throughout my formative years was that a stable career in a field like nursing would always be in demand, providing a sense of stability and financial security. However, I had secretly aspired to be a scientist or journalist, perhaps a fusion of both.\n\nDespite my passion for those fields, I chose nursing, and here I am, 15 years later, unable to work and living off of disability benefits. The financial struggles have been relentless, leaving me with little to call my own. Yet, it's the kindness of my family and a select few friends that has allowed me to navigate these challenges. In the face of adversity, I've come to realize the importance of humility and knowing when to ask for help.\n\nMy experience has taught me that life's unpredictable nature means that we will inevitably face emergencies, whether big or small. Preparation is essential, but it's equally crucial to acknowledge that some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I firmly believe that the United States would benefit from a shift in values, moving away from an overreliance on the government and towards a culture of mutual support and trust.\n\nThe notion of \"rugged individualism\" is often touted as the core American value, but history suggests that our ancestors' success during trying times was largely due to the collective efforts of their communities. The pioneers who traversed the American wilderness in wagon trains didn't achieve their goals in isolation. Instead, they relied on one another for support and shared resources.\n\nWhile preparing for the unexpected is wise, it's equally important to cultivate a sense of community. I've assembled a basic disaster preparedness kit, complete with essential supplies like first aid kits, water purification tablets, and protective gear. However, I also believe that building relationships with those around me is just as crucial. If you have the means, consider investing in a small garden or a wood-burning stove – but don't underestimate the value of getting to know your neighbors.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a complex and multifaceted issue. Despite D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that scientists still struggle to quantify the intricacies of organic forms, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of evolution. Recent studies have applied this approach to the development and diversification of mollusk skeletons, with notable contributions from researchers such as Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our investigation explores the potential of mathematical modeling, combined with experimental research, to elucidate the mechanisms governing the pace and direction of evolutionary development in the genus Prunum. We utilized X-ray imaging to identify quantitative characteristics that could be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies, which were then inputted into the CerioShell software program developed by Stone in 1995. By generating hypothetical shell forms, we aimed to define the boundaries within which morphological variation could occur in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary processes in this group.\n\nThe shell of a mollusk can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional tube that undergoes a continuous transformation through 360 degrees of space over time. This process can be visualized as a series of coiled spirals, known as whorls, which revolve around a central axis referred to as the columella. The columella traverses the central column of the shell, while the whorls are separated by continuous lines called sutures. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and the largest whorl, typically the body whorl, occupies the outermost position in most shells. The spire consists of all whorls except the final one, with the apex representing the terminal point and the base situated at the opposite end. The animal emerges through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards, is commonly employed. A systematic method for counting whorls involves examining the shell from the apical view and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this reference point, estimating to a quarter of a whorl when necessary.\n\nThe shell can also be perceived as a series of interconnected apertures that traverse time and space as the mollusk builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture through coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, a trajectory can be mapped. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing for the manipulation of parameters and modification of the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality over the past decade has been stagnant. Despite making strides in meeting Millennium Development Goals, such as achieving water and sanitation targets, the country is struggling to make significant improvements in child and maternal health, which is essential for meeting its target goals by 2015.  The multifaceted reasons behind this stagnation will be explored below, highlighting the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on programmatic interventions.\n\nNotably, Indonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of deliveries now meeting this criterion. However, this metric encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, resulting in a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhaging.  Consequently, the progress made in this area is somewhat misleading, underscoring the need for further action.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases among children under five treated by a healthcare professional, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a concerning trend across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%.  This rate is particularly concerning, as the disparity between urban and rural areas is striking, with a rate of 7% in urban settings compared to just 2% in rural areas.  This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with a clear bias towards urban areas.  Another concern is vertical equity, as there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the disadvantaged are facing significant barriers to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nConsidering the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how to most effectively address the lack of access to services.  Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize developing targeted program-specific approaches or strengthening the overarching health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While program-specific approaches have the advantage of being more focused and manageable, with faster results, they also have several drawbacks.  A significant drawback is that investing heavily in a particular area can divert resources away from other areas, leading to a shortage of human resources and duplication of services.  For instance, the influx of international funding for HIV/AIDS has had a ripple effect on the family planning sector, leading to a shift in focus and resources.",
            "The Victorian literary canon is distinguished by its meticulous attention to nuance and its preoccupation with the elite social strata of the era.  However, two outliers within this tradition are Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Both novels diverge from the conventional mold by incorporating elements of mystery and the uncanny, which serves to enrich the characterization and provide a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nA pivotal passage from Dickens' work exemplifies this phenomenon: \"And now, a multitude of perplexing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to be moving between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated dispute; their words echoed in his ears, and when he regained his composure, he found himself conversing with them. Sudden gunshots shattered the air, and a cacophony of cries and shouts erupted. Lights danced before his eyes, and he was whisked away by an unseen force. Amidst this maelstrom, a nagging sense of pain persisted, gnawing at his consciousness.\"\n\nThese novels frequently employ dream sequences or trance-like states to convey the mystery, though the context and purpose vary in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic events often offer insight into Oliver's inner struggles, his emotional anguish, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of Oliver's shooting in chapter 28 is a striking example of this technique. The scene is rendered in vivid detail, as if a dream, while Oliver desperately seeks help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as the precarious state of his health, which is starkly evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms Oliver, numbing his senses, and he is borne away by an unseen force, his despair revisited, now a constant companion, intertwined with fear rather than surprise. This event begs the question of whose agency lies behind Oliver's misfortune, as it is clear that it was not his own. Furthermore, this incident contributes to the narrative's portrayal of Oliver's growing sense of defeat, suggesting that he has been broken by the influence of old Fagin, forcing him to accept his despair and diminishing his capacity for resistance.\n\nA haunting passage from Wuthering Heights further illustrates this concept: \"The day passed – day; it was forgotten as soon as it arrived – and night fell once more; a night so oppressive in its stillness and fleeting in its duration.\"",
            "I recall a pivotal experience from several years ago when I worked as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary school students. My primary focus was on assisting students with their academic struggles, particularly in English and reading. One student, a young boy named Adrian, stood out to me. Although he spoke fluent English, he exhibited peculiar difficulties with reading, which puzzled me at first. I hypothesized that his challenges lay not in comprehension but rather in recognizing written English. This epiphany struck me when I met his mother, who spoke only Spanish, and we managed to communicate using my limited Spanish skills. This experience illuminated the complexities of language barriers in education, particularly in regions like California.\n\nBy sharing this story, I aim to highlight the pressing issue of language barriers in schools and its subtleties. Even students with native-like fluency in a language can face significant obstacles when confronted with reading materials. The problem is multifaceted, and its solutions cannot be simplified. In Adrian's case, targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved beneficial. However, for non-native English speakers, the solution is more intricate.\n\nThe dual language system, a widely debated topic, presents a promising approach. Studies have shown that children in bilingual education programs perform better academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation, I argue that such programs can benefit all students, not just those with Spanish as their first language. To implement this effectively, we must consider several factors. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical, we can provide bilingual support staff to assist in the classroom. This could include tutors, educational aids, or other specialized resources. By combining these measures, we can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment for all students.\n\nBy acknowledging the complexities of language barriers and embracing innovative solutions, we can better support students like Adrian and promote academic success across the board. The key lies in integration, not isolation, of various approaches to address this pressing issue.",
            "As individuals, we've long been confronted with the notion of an existence beyond our own understanding. This abstract concept is frequently discussed in various settings – from Sunday school to temple services or introspective self-discovery. Many people instinctively adopt the faith systems imparted by their parents, while others reject these traditions outright, doubting the existence of anything beyond their own personal realities. Our perspectives on spirituality evolve as we navigate different value structures, often finding new meaning through our individual experiences. We seek illumination in the darkness, striving to break free from the shadows and step into the light.\n\nMy recollection of a conversation with my father is vivid. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain drumming against the tin roof. The downpour cascaded from the gutters, submerging the plants along the porch's edge. My father, lost in thought, gazed out into the rain with a contemplative expression, his eyes avoiding direct contact. His physical appearance had changed over the past few months – his clothes hung loosely on his frame, and his hair had thinned significantly. The air was heavy with unspoken emotions as I hesitated to discuss my impending loss. Instead, I opted to share a moment of physical comfort, embracing him and sitting closer to his side as we both gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nTragedy struck just a few months later, on the fifth day after my 22nd birthday, in December. The grueling treatments had prolonged his life, but failed to alleviate his suffering. I grappled with the concept of a higher power, questioning its benevolence in allowing my father to endure such pain. Alone in the darkness, I refrained from prayer, having lost faith in a deity that seemed to have abandoned me.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness my father's passing. Instead, I chose to recall his life and not his death, focusing on the memories of how he lived rather than how he left. I knew my father better than anyone, and I believed he would have wanted me to cherish the time we had, rather than being present during his final moments. For three days, I retreated to the safety of my bed, waiting for the news that would change everything.\n\nThe silence was deafening, as the phone remained still and unresponsive.",
            "The notion of the Gothic Novel as a genre is often paradoxical, embodying both the old and the new. This dichotomy is astutely observed by Ian Watt, who describes it as an \"oxymoron\" in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has been subject to a range of interpretations, from dismissive critiques to enthusiastic acclaim, with some seeing it as lacking depth and others extolling its capacity to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The pioneering work of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto played a significant role in shaping the Gothic genre, drawing on both ancient and modern narrative traditions to create a novel that blended the old with the new. Walpole's use of theatrical elements and modern storytelling techniques enabled him to craft a new form of literary expression that he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The genre relies heavily on references to medieval theatre, architecture, and cultural heritage, which were seen as archaic and unsophisticated in the context of emerging modernity.\n\nThe fusion of traditional and modern elements allowed Gothic literature to endure and adapt to changing times, becoming both outdated and new to readers across different eras. One of the key features of the Gothic genre is its representation of chivalry, a medieval concept that emphasized the development of a noble knight. This ideal, characterized by bravery, honor, and competence, is a recurring theme in Gothic literature, particularly in The Castle of Otranto. The chivalric code serves as a means of nostalgia and idealization of the past, foreshadowing the emergence of Romanticism. In Walpole's time, this nostalgia was likely influenced by his disillusionment with the present, which he saw as lacking in the values and morality of the past. This is reflected in the character of Frederic, who embodies the chivalric ideals and is described as a prince who has suffered and been shaped by his experiences.\n\nWalpole's portrayal of Frederic is a masterful blend of traditional chivalric imagery, including his status as a prince, his tragic past, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. This portrayal is an early example of the Gothic trope of excess, which would become a hallmark of the genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management encompasses a multifaceted array of processes that govern the trajectory of goods from the initial customer order to the final stages of product distribution. The term itself was first coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a forward-thinking consultant, who described the intricate process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer demands in a timely and efficient manner. Central to this process are six critical components that serve as the cornerstone of a well-structured supply chain: production, supply, inventory management, location optimization, transportation logistics, and information exchange.\n\nProduction is the foundational step in the supply chain process, setting the tone for the entire operation. It involves a thorough examination of customer requirements, which can be gleaned from market analysis. By understanding market trends and customer needs, managers can make informed decisions regarding product offerings and production volumes. The choice of production location is also crucial, taking into account factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. To ensure a seamless production process, managers must prioritize scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance, recognizing that even the smallest detail can have far-reaching consequences for the company's bottom line. Efficient planning and execution are essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nSupply is the second key element in the supply chain management framework. It involves making strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may opt to outsource certain processes to external partners, leveraging their specialized skills and expertise to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs. This strategic approach allows companies to tap into the strengths of various divisions, each with its unique equipment, workforce, and specialties. By doing so, they can optimize their operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.",
            "A disturbing message scrawled on a makeshift sign in Burma, a Southeast Asian nation, has caught the attention of passerby. Ellen Page, known for her poignant portrayal in the film \"Juno,\" stands solitary on a street corner, the cardboard placard held high above her head with a bold, black Sharpie inscription. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been ruled by a ruling junta since 1962, following a military coup d'état. A significant turning point in the country's history occurred in 2007, when a wave of public protests broke out, led by a large number of Burmese monks. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these demonstrations drew international attention, sparking a violent crackdown by the military junta, which targeted monasteries and rounded up foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who lost his life while covering a street protest in September 2007.\n\nThis distressing event is not an isolated incident. The desire for complete control and suppression of dissent has been a recurring theme throughout human history. From ancient civilizations to modern-day governments, the pursuit of absolute power has led to numerous tragic consequences. In the past, Roman emperors claimed divine authority to govern their societies, while in Japan, the emperor is considered a deity, believed to guide his people towards prosperity through technological advancements and spiritual practices. In the present day, high-ranking officials engage in confidential meetings with influential leaders, highlighting the complex relationships between power and governance.\n\nHistorical examples of such authoritarianism include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered against the government's oppressive rule. Reports of the event's death toll vary significantly, with official estimates ranging from 200 to 300, while eyewitness accounts suggest a much higher number, between 2,000 and 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderates, is another harrowing example. The atrocities committed during WWII, including the persecution of Jews under the Nazi regime, are also a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on the jazz genre stems in large part from his remarkable longevity and the resultant influence on his musical ensemble. While his piano contributions may not be immediately apparent in the selections for this assignment, his compositional prowess stands out for its ability to showcase the unique talents of individual band members. Through his expert crafting of musical frameworks, Ellington empowered soloists to improvise freely while also composing intricate, tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted the distinct qualities of each band member. Consequently, the collective sound of his orchestra became a hallmark of his work, yielding coherent and original musical textures that suited each piece uniquely. \n\nAs an authority on Ellington's contributions to jazz, the Grove Music dictionary notes his innovative use of voice as a sonic instrument. A notable example of this can be seen in Creole Love Call, which utilizes voice to add depth and timbre without the constraint of lyrics. By doing so, Ellington demonstrates his skill in complementing the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. This deliberate, twelve-bar blues piece, comprising six choruses, exemplifies his approach:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between the vocalist and reeds, characterized by a smooth, melodic introduction and a rougher, more dramatic conclusion.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the melodic theme, incorporating extended blue notes to add emotional depth.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a syncopated piano phrase that underscores the emotional intensity.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble recaptures the essence of the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, marked by the reeds taking the lead in a call-and-response sequence, accompanied by stop-time syncopation from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the opening structure, with the vocalist adopting a growl technique, soloing as if an instrument.\nA final, brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant, novel conclusion courtesy of a trombone.\n\nEllington's incorporation of voice as a means of adding tonal dimension to his compositions is a recurring motif throughout his work.\n\nOne year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combined his skill in crafting tightly orchestrated pieces with his keen sense of tonal color in Hot and Bothered. The call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing masterfully combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, yielding a rich, complementary sound. This approach is further refined in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "There was a void within her that had long defied satisfaction. It began to take shape when she was 14, during the tumultuous transition into adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the yearning still lingered, now with a distinct desire for human connection over abstract concepts. Yet, she found herself disinterested in the prospect of romantic relationships, as if an invisible barrier had been erected, shielding her from the affections of others. Some had attempted to breach this barrier, with awkward and often unsuccessful overtures, but none had managed to pique her interest. She often found herself questioning this phenomenon, searching for a plausible explanation, but no theory seemed satisfactory.\n\nOrdinarily, her home was a tranquil haven. Her parents were level-headed individuals, rarely engaging in conflict with one another or with her. However, they did occasionally disagree about her independent nature and free-spirited personality, which often clashed with their more subdued approach to life. Her parents' calm demeanor was a stark contrast to her own effervescent personality, yet it was her likable and kind nature that had earned her a special place in their hearts.\n\nToday, however, was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, a sudden, high-pitched cry pierced the air, followed by the unmistakable sound of her mother's voice. She hastened into the kitchen, alarm coursing through her veins as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" Upon entering the room, she was met with the unexpected sight of her mother lying on the floor, wincing in pain as she repeatedly muttered, \"Ow\" in short, labored breaths. Her daughter rushed to her mother's side, placing a supporting hand on her arm, and asked, \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were hushed and strained, and her daughter sensed the gravity of the situation. \"Okay, Mom, just point me in the right direction,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the growing unease within her. Her mother's directions were clear, and at that moment, her daughter was grateful for the physical training she had undergone. With a sense of determination, she lifted her mother into the car and set her in the backseat.\n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere, heavy with the scent of disinfectant and the faint tang of illness, seemed to amplify the sense of foreboding that hung in the air. But her daughter's anxiety was superseded by her concern for her mother's well-being. She hurriedly escorted her mother to the hospital bed, where a team of medical professionals quickly sprang into action, their faces etched with worry. A gurney was summoned, and her mother was carefully transferred onto it. As the doctors began their assessment, her daughter was left to sit, her anxiety simmering just beneath the surface.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had suffered an accident while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet. She had fallen off a step stool.",
            "The objective of this investigation was to investigate the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, quantified by an alternate Mediterranean diet score, and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. This study focused on the modified Mediterranean diet, which is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, including plant proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as a reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also permitted in this dietary pattern.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated an inverse association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, as well as an intervention trial that showed the Mediterranean diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles in obese individuals. However, prior research has not specifically examined the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke mortality.\n\nThis observational study followed a cohort of 74,886 female nurses, aged 38-63 years, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a large-scale prospective study of female nurses in 11 US states. The study collected data over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2004, with participants completing six food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to assess their dietary intake. The FFQs were validated through various methods, including medical and hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nThe study controlled for potential confounding variables, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, by adjusting for these factors in the analysis. To minimize random variation in individual data and capture long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated from the repeated FFQs. \n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal outcomes. The results indicated that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were documented. Women in the highest quintile of alternate Mediterranean diet score exhibited a reduced risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked the onset of a severe economic downturn in the United States. As the housing market imploded, unemployment skyrocketed, and many major corporations found themselves on the brink of collapse. The lasting impact of this crisis necessitates an examination of its origins and potential solutions. In essence, the housing market collapse was precipitated by a combination of misguided policy decisions and a fragile financial infrastructure. Specifically, banks and financial institutions were incentivized to issue subprime loans, which were then repackaged and sold as complex financial instruments. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the resulting financial chaos was disproportionately borne by the institutions that had invested in these securities.\n\nA crucial turning point occurred in 1999, during the Clinton administration, when the president sought to bolster his popularity ahead of a re-election bid. In an effort to achieve this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, creating an environment conducive to the subprime crisis that would unfold in the following years. Notably, Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted in 1999 that this course of action could have disastrous consequences, stating that Fannie Mae's \"phenomenal growth in profits\" was being fueled by a \"government-subsidized corporation\" that was \"under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people.\" Holmes astutely recognized the potential risks of this approach, warning that the company \"may run into trouble in an economic downturn.\"\n\nThe structural vulnerabilities of the housing market played a significant role in perpetuating the crisis. The proliferation of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) created a complex web of interconnected financial assets. This, in turn, led to a situation in which U.S. households and financial markets became heavily reliant on the housing market, rendering them acutely vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in prices. Ultimately, the housing bubble burst, causing widespread financial institutions to bear the brunt of the losses. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, representing approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. The financial fallout was severe, with Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch being acquired at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers being dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley being forced to convert to commercial banks subject to stricter regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "The Art of Disclosing: A Cautionary Tale for the Overexpository\n\nIt's a familiar phenomenon – that moment in a story where the writer's creative wings begin to unfold, transporting readers to new heights of wonder or, conversely, inducing a sense of listlessness. Even the most seasoned authors, like Dr. Merlin, have succumbed to the pitfalls of excessive exposition, only to be met with a cacophony of frustration at their digital doorstep.\n\nExposition, as we all know, is the nemesis of engaging storytelling. While it's essential to provide context, there's a fine line between informative passages and narrative overload. Dr. Merlin cautions against allowing exposition to dictate the tempo of your narrative, lest it stifles the very essence of your tale.\n\nThe adage \"Show, don't tell\" is a fundamental principle of good writing, and yet, many authors still falter in this regard. Exposition often masquerades as a harmless indulgence, but in reality, it's a subtle saboteur that can derail even the most promising narratives.\n\nIn film and literature, exposition can manifest as a character's lengthy monologue or, in the case of fiction, the author's own telling of events. A pertinent example is the tale of a heroine whose life is recounted in rapid succession – her meeting, her marriage, her husband's untimely demise. Rather than diving headfirst into the aftermath, the author often devotes an inordinate amount of space to summarizing these events. A more effective approach would be to weave these details into the fabric of the narrative, allowing the reader to develop an emotional connection with the characters and their experiences.\n\nTake the introduction of a new character, for instance. Rather than dumping a plethora of biographical information – military background, current occupation, past marriages, and personal aspirations – consider peppering these details throughout the narrative, allowing them to emerge organically. This approach will create a more nuanced and engaging character, and, ultimately, a more immersive reading experience.\n\nIn short, it's essential to provide substance to the bare bones of your story. Resist the temptation to rush through pivotal moments, and instead, take the time to breathe life into the narrative. By doing so, you'll craft a tale that lingers in the reader's mind, long after the final page has been turned.",
            "I tuned in to two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio on the morning of August 13, 2011. The first, an NBC 4 broadcast, featured a live report. The lead story centered on a domestic assault case in Ashley, Ohio, where a local man named Shad Hostettler had allegedly assaulted his wife. The station's coverage provided a brief overview, stating that multiple stab wounds were involved and that Hostettler had been apprehended. The brevity of the report seemed reasonable, given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, in which an 18-year-old victim, Travis Buyers, had been critically injured. The authorities had yet to identify any suspects or make arrests at the time of the broadcast. The SWAT team was investigating the incident. This story seemed relatively short, and one possible reason for this might be the neighborhood in which the shooting occurred. Observing a pattern over the years, I have noticed that certain communities and individuals often receive lesser media attention when they are victims of crime.\n\nThe next segment reported on a shooting incident involving a Med-Flight helicopter, which had sustained damage from a .22 caliber rifle round. The authorities were seeking information from the public to aid in the identification of the perpetrator, offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to an arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend predicted scattered thunderstorms on Saturday, with temperatures ranging from the mid-to-low eighties. The brevity of this segment may have been intentional, as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie, was said to be approximately 6 feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The emphasis on the perpetrator's skin tone and physical appearance struck me as unusual.\n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a report on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating the sentence, the newscaster referred to the 300-month prison term. I am unsure of the reasoning behind this choice of words. Additionally, the report mentioned Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, which, in my opinion, was not particularly relevant to the story.",
            "In the complex tapestry of human relationships, one bond stands out for its peculiar depth and intensity: the bond between brothers. This connection, born of shared experiences and mutual understanding, is a multifaceted entity that encompasses a wide range of emotions, from the purest love to the darkest cruelty. It is in the most trying of circumstances that the true nature of this bond is revealed, often with far-reaching consequences. The intricate dance of emotions that defines the brotherly bond can be a double-edged sword, leading to profound self-discovery and a deeper understanding of one's own character.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, delving into the labyrinthine emotions that accompany it. Against the backdrop of a lush, vividly described landscape, two brothers embark on a perilous journey that is ultimately doomed to fail. The tension between bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a boiling point in a climactic confrontation, resulting in a tragedy that leaves one brother alive. Through the protagonist's character development and interactions with his brother, as well as the narrative's introspective tone, the novel effectively conveys the complex interplay of emotions that shape the protagonist's actions.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's motivations is a singular emotion: pride. From their earliest encounters, the protagonist harbors a deep-seated resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. The protagonist's idealized vision of brotherhood, which includes sharing exciting experiences like exploring the wilderness and engaging in physical activities, is cruelly shattered by Doodle's fragile health. The protagonist's frustration and anger are palpable, even extending to the point of considering a heinous act. However, a simple gesture from Doodle – a smile – momentarily assuages the protagonist's darker impulses, revealing a glimmer of love and compassion that lies beneath his resentment. This dichotomy highlights the complexity of the protagonist's emotions, underscoring the idea that even in the depths of despair, there is always a spark of goodness that can be fanned into flame.",
            "As the cerebral cortex has evolved, so too have the analogies employed to elucidate its intricate functions. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then augmented by the metaphor of a papyrus scroll, followed by the more mechanistic notion of a book, and most recently, a computer has been invoked. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that the utility of these analogies is inherently limited and may lead to unintended inferences.\n\nPerception begins with the transformation of sensory stimuli into electrochemical signals by the sensory organs. These signals undergo iterative processing through the brain's algorithms, combining both hierarchical and feedback-driven mechanisms. For instance, when observing a black box on a white background, the hierarchical processing integrates basic features such as color, orientation, and spatial boundaries to identify the object as a box. Meanwhile, the feedback-driven mechanism utilizes pre-existing knowledge to refine the recognition and distinguish it from a box-shaped void in the background.\n\nInformation processing reaches a critical juncture when an attentional filter determines the signal's salience and allocates cognitive resources accordingly. As an illustration, although the brain processes every individual blade of grass when one gazes at their shoes, a healthy attentional filter prevents individual blades from being consciously noted, whereas the name \"John\" might be picked out amidst background noise. This dynamic interplay between processing stages is recurrently modulated by attention.\n\nFor information to be processed, it must first be stored. The brain employs multiple forms of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information undergoes encoding, which varies depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal information can be encoded based on its structural characteristics, phonetic properties, or semantic meaning. Subsequently, information must be maintained. Research on animal subjects suggests that working memory, which has a duration of approximately 20 seconds, relies on a transient electrical signal traversing a specific series of neurons. The storage of long-term memories is hypothesized to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nDifferent theories have been proposed to explain the cerebral organization of knowledge, drawing from human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, interconnected according to their semantic relationships. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the emerging threat of technological advancements and the capitalist systems that perpetuate them. In Huxley's vision of the future, societal values prioritize communal harmony over individual autonomy, with citizens conditioned from birth to pursue immediate gratification above all else. This collective acceptance of a predetermined fate is orchestrated by the enigmatic World Controller, who wields control over the masses through a rigid ideology.\n\nWhen examined through the lens of Marxist thought, Huxley's work reveals a profound skepticism towards the capitalist systems of his time. The author employs Marxist terminology, such as 'homogeny' and 'reification,' to illustrate the insidious effects of unchecked economic development. Huxley's use of these terms underscores his concern that the capitalist system perpetuates a false sense of reality, where individuals are disconnected from their true social and economic relationships.\n\nThe concept of false consciousness, a central tenet of Marxist theory, is exemplified in Huxley's portrayal of the working-class citizens in Brave New World. These individuals are manipulated into prioritizing their own self-interest over any notion of collective solidarity or social awareness. The conditioning of the population through hypnopædia reinforces this notion, as citizens are conditioned to crave consumption, indulgence, and conformity above all else. This is a deliberate tactic of control, orchestrated by the World Controller, to maintain the status quo and preserve the hegemony of the ruling elite.\n\nHuxley's depiction of social hierarchy in Brave New World is a masterful commentary on the oppressive nature of capitalism. The lower classes, exemplified by the Delta and Gamma castes, are oblivious to the machinations of the ruling class, while the upper classes, represented by the Alphas and Betas, are either complicit in their own oppression or apathetic towards the plight of others. The relationships between characters in the novel are superficial and lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has stifled human connections and emotional expression.\n\nFurthermore, Huxley's work highlights the ways in which capitalist systems breed complacency and obedience among the working class. The societal classes are content with their roles in the hierarchy, further reinforcing the Marxist notion that the proletariat are conditioned to believe in their own superiority, as long as they conform to the expectations of their peers and consume according to the dictates of the ruling class.",
            "As a member of the University Park community for the past two and a half years, I have become increasingly aware of the challenges associated with navigating our campus. The sprawling nature of the school, combined with its rapid expansion, has made getting from one destination to another a time-consuming and often arduous task. My personal experience of traveling from my off-campus residence in Stuart Hall to various classes, such as those in the Willard building, has sometimes taken up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when weather conditions are unfavorable. I recall speaking to an alumnus who shared with me the history of the East Halls dormitory complex, which was once isolated from the rest of campus by a large tract of undeveloped land. However, this open space has since given way to new sports facilities, buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and surrounding residential units. As the campus continues to grow and evolve, it is crucial to address the issue of mobility.\n\nI recently engaged in a conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his renewed enthusiasm for this mode of transportation by remarking, \"Bikes are my go-to; for a while, it wasn't the most popular option, but it's the most efficient way to get around.\" Not only does cycling offer physical benefits, but it also allows individuals to cover significant distances without expending excessive time or energy. In fact, a nutritious meal and some moderate exercise can easily cover 30 miles or more. As someone who now resides off-campus, I can attest to the value of owning a bike. What has been my most practical decision this year has been purchasing a bicycle, allowing me to travel from my residence to Thomas building, which is approximately a 25-minute walk, in just 5 minutes when I pedal at a brisk pace. Nevertheless, I have encountered challenges while navigating Pollock Road, which offers the most direct route to Thomas building from my home. While walking has its benefits, I find that I am too busy to devote the necessary time to this mode of transportation. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for attending classes and other activities, resulting in an additional 30-40 minutes of travel time each day. Over the course of a week, this would translate to over 2.5 hours, which I simply cannot afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

My professional values include dedication to service, respect for individuals, a strong commitment to ethics, and a relentless pursuit of personal and professional growth to ensure excellence in my field. These core values not only reflect the principles of social work but also resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have always been driven by a desire to make a positive difference in the lives of others. However, I was initially uncertain about the career path that would allow me to achieve this goal. My experiences in high school and college exposed me to individuals who struggled with various challenges, and I witnessed firsthand the importance of effective coping mechanisms. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a deliberate break to reflect on my career aspirations. It was during this time that I had an epiphany. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was dealing with a difficult home situation. His story had a profound impact on me, and I felt compelled to take action. I reached out to the authorities and offered my support, leveraging my degree in Psychology to help address the situation. The experience marked a turning point for me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work, which would enable me to make a tangible difference in the lives of children and families.\n\nIn addition to service, social justice is another value that drives me to pursue a career in social work. As a society, we often emphasize the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to societal norms. I believe that this dichotomy is a reflection of our desire to be part of a larger collective, rather than embracing our unique characteristics. Throughout my academic and personal journey, I have consistently sought to challenge social norms and promote inclusivity. I have expressed my individuality through self-expression, participating in various extracurricular activities and causes that align with my values, such as advocating for social justice and equality.",
            "This paper delves into the dual perspectives of biological and sociocultural factors contributing to the complex issue of insomnia. The biological model delves into the genetic underpinnings of sleep disorders, encompassing heritable traits and physiological aspects that impact sleep patterns. Conversely, the sociocultural model explores environmental relationships and their influence on sleep, taking into account demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographics.\n\nInsomnia can manifest as a primary sleep disorder, a comorbid condition with a mental health disorder, or a disorder precipitated by medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, with Dyssonmias encompassing Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other related conditions. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, marked by cataplexy and automatic REM sleep, is a distinct entity within this category. In contrast, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral or physiological abnormalities, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders is centered on the role of genetics, inherited factors, and the physiological mechanisms governing sleep-wake cycles. Research has identified key neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, which regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are crucial for modulating sleep-wake states. The activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and facilitate sleep. Furthermore, a GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor could compromise an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as the heritability of the phenotype could influence sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities.",
            "Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a complex condition that affects the brain's ability to process auditory information. This disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the inefficient transmission of auditory signals to the brain, resulting in difficulties with sound perception and processing. In essence, individuals with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain struggles to interpret and make sense of the auditory information. This distinction is crucial, as it differentiates CAPD from hearing impairments, which involve the physical inability to perceive sounds.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the early 1950s, when researchers first identified the disorder as \"auditory imperception.\" Subsequent studies by Italian researchers, led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, laid the groundwork for the development of tests to assess auditory processing in children with communicative disorders. The introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961 further advanced our understanding of the physiological basis of auditory processing. A national conference convened in 1977 sparked a surge in research focused on CAPD, paving the way for the development of diagnostic tools and treatments.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, acoustic event discrimination, sound pattern recognition, speech differentiation, and sound synthesis. Individuals with CAPD may also struggle to sequence auditory information, leading to challenges with auditory processing. Other common symptoms include sound blocking, where a subsequent sound obscures the preceding one, and the inability to differentiate changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm through changes in tone.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's auditory function, which may include systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory tests administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals. While no single test or tool is universally accepted as a diagnostic gold standard, a range of measures are used to assess auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The use of disguise as a means of deception in Twelfth Night raises intriguing questions about the consequences of adopting a new persona. On one hand, the adoption of a disguise can facilitate deception and allow individuals to navigate complex social situations, but it also risks leading to a loss of one's true identity. The difficulty of ending a deception is further complicated by the possibility of alienation, as others may respond with offense or disinterest upon discovering the truth.\n\nThe theme of deception in the context of gender role reversal is particularly fraught, as it highlights the underlying motivations behind adopting a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to assume the identity of a man is driven by a desire for self-preservation, as she seeks to protect herself from potential threats in a foreign land. However, this decision comes at a cost, as it isolates her from her support network and creates complications in her relationships with others.\n\nThe dynamics between Viola, Olivia, and Orsino are complex and multifaceted. Olivia's confusion of Viola with Sebastian and her subsequent romantic feelings for Cesario raise questions about the nature of attraction and desire. One interpretation is that the appearance of Cesario forces Olivia to confront her own suppressed emotions, but this reading is complicated by the fact that Olivia's affections seem to shift easily, suggesting that her feelings may be driven by superficial characteristics rather than deeper emotional connections.\n\nThis nuance is underscored by Olivia's later characterization of Viola as a sister, which suggests that her earlier romantic feelings for Cesario were perhaps superficial or misguided. The play thus raises questions about the complexities of human relationships and the ways in which we navigate our emotions and desires.\n\nUltimately, Twelfth Night presents a rich and thought-provoking exploration of the human experience, one that challenges readers to consider the consequences of deception, the complexity of identity, and the nature of human relationships.",
            "The German colonial administration has been characterized by its starkly differing approaches to governance, with certain colonies exhibiting notably harsh treatment of indigenous populations. The Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa are a striking example of this, with widespread accounts of genocide and brutality. However, it would be inaccurate to generalize the entire colonial empire's policies based on a single instance. The German colonial administration's policies and approaches varied significantly across the colonies, mirroring the region's diverse geography.\n\nEducation provision, in particular, demonstrated considerable variation across the colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (now known as Tanzania) in 1919, they found an educated and literate indigenous population, with some praising the German efforts in this regard. Conversely, German colonial policies in Kamerun and other territories received similarly positive commentary from contemporaries.\n\nSouth West Africa, now Namibia, presented a stark contrast to East Africa. In the latter, the government played a pivotal role in establishing state schools and providing education to the local population. In contrast, the responsibility for educating native populations in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies, which received limited support from the government. The administration, however, invested substantial resources in educating the European population, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions. The educational policies implemented in South West Africa had lasting effects on the colony, persisting even after German rule. Conversely, other German colonies witnessed significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic elements, contributed to the divergent experiences of South West Africa.\n\nThis investigation aims to build upon existing research by examining the underlying factors that led to this divergence, with particular emphasis on recent studies examining the views of settlers and colonial authorities on indigenous populations. \n\nA substantial body of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, with a significant portion of this literature written in German and produced during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in individual colonies. Later studies written in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education across various colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa offers a comprehensive comparison of the two colonies' educational systems and identifies key factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the presence of a substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the colony's distinct characteristics.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, despite the prevalence of arid desert terrain. This environment attracted a larger European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to approximately 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",

Furthermore, numerous sub-genres have branched out from the primary categories of rock, jazz, folk, and country, rendering the musical landscape increasingly complex. Among these, the heavy metal sub-genre has emerged as a particularly dynamic and expressive force, with a propensity for conveying a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nThe diversity of heavy metal is evident in its adaptability, as artists began to experiment and push the boundaries of the genre from its inception. This fluidity has given rise to a multitude of sub-genres, each with its unique characteristics, resulting in a rich tapestry of sounds. The proliferation of niches within the heavy metal movement has reached a point where defining the genre has become a challenging endeavor.\n\nTo grasp the essence of contemporary metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the underlying principles that drive its evolution. Heavy metal can be seen as a movement characterized by its affinity for the darker aspects of human experience. Musically, this is manifested through an emphasis on volume, intensity, and technical proficiency, often accompanied by theatricality and a sense of chaos. Lyrically, heavy metal often explores themes of darkness, introspection, and the human condition, often drawing from literary and philosophical influences.\n\nThe roots of heavy metal can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s, when psychedelic rock and the counterculture movement fostered a climate of experimentation and innovation. The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, exemplifies this spirit of pushing boundaries and exploring the darker aspects of human experience. Written in response to the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" \"Helter Skelter\" demonstrated the Beatles' willingness to confront the heavier and more aggressive side of rock music, paving the way for the development of the heavy metal genre.",
            "In the years preceding the Surrealist art movement, an innovative artist was quietly weaving his own brand of reality, both literally and figuratively. Henri Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only showcases a woman captivated by the wonders of a fantastical realm but also serves as a poignant reflection of the artist's own aspirations and inner turmoil. Having longed for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers, Rousseau grappled with a profound internal conflict – to conform to the conventions of his time or to forge his own unique path, unencumbered by the expectations of the art world he admired.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream within this context, one must first delve into the life and experiences that shaped Rousseau's artistic vision. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau came from a family that enjoyed a comfortable upper-class existence. His father operated a successful business, which provided him with a relatively stable upbringing. Despite the absence of formal artistic training, Rousseau spent over two decades employed in a mundane job with the municipal toll service, earning him the colloquial nickname \"douanier\" – a customs inspector – although his official title was gabelou. The untimely death of his first wife and eight infant children left Rousseau heartbroken, with only his daughter Julia remaining. This loss marked a turning point in his life, prompting him to seek solace in painting as a means of escape and renewal. Unlike his contemporaries, who often idolized and romanticized the peasantry, Rousseau drew inspiration from the experiences and aspirations of the common man.\n\nGiven his unorthodox background and the fact that he began his artistic journey at an advanced age, Rousseau's desire for recognition in the art world is understandable. He produced his works alongside some of the most renowned artists of his time, including Henri Matisse, who was just beginning to establish himself as a prominent figure in the art world. According to Jan Gordon's account in Modern French Painters, the two artists, while technically rivals, differed in their motivations and artistic visions. While Matisse sought to avoid the mundane and trite, Rousseau aimed to create works that were so conventional that they would be acknowledged by the French art establishment.",
            "Philosophers have long debated the connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are deeply intertwined. I propose that there is a fundamental reason for this association. The poet John Keats' famous phrase in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" encapsulates this idea: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding of the world comes from education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional means of acquisition. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate, the nature of right and wrong, or what makes a work beautiful.\n\nMore specifically, critiques of art and morality often struggle to capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. In discussions of art, such as those surrounding Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may focus on technical aspects like composition, context, or cultural significance, but these elements only scratch the surface. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often express that there's something intangible that sets it apart. I believe that art and morals share this elusive quality, which cannot be fully reduced to a description of their characteristics. As writer Flannery O'Connor noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics and aesthetics possess a transcendent dimension that cannot be captured by analysis.\n\nWittgenstein's assertion that \"ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental\" underscores the inexpressible nature of ethics. I propose that this transcendent aspect is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and serves as a common thread connecting them. \n\nI also believe that the relationship between ethics and aesthetics is rooted in their shared capacity to evoke a profound, yet inexplicable, sense of connection. This phenomenon is most pronounced in literature, as McKean suggests: \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern identity is characterized by its robust cultural landscape, a harmonious blend of influences stretching from the picturesque Alpine region around Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This rich cultural tapestry is also evident in Köln, situated on the Rhine River, and extends through the heart of the country to Dresden, a city nestled on the banks of the Elbe. Given its unique cultural heritage, it is hardly surprising that Germany's modern identity has evolved from a complex interplay of various historical sources and tribes.\n\nThe origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in debate among scholars and historians. Some attribute the name to the Tungrian tribe, which, according to Tacitus, was known as the Germans prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in battles with Gaulish forces (Tacitus, circa 98 CE). Alternatively, Julius Caesar's writings on the Gallic Wars (50-40 BC) suggest that he derived the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between those they had conquered and those they had not. In his commentary, Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, circa 50-40 BC). Others propose that the term \"German\" may be linked to the Gaulish word for \"neighbor\" or the Old English word \"ger,\" referring to a spear used in warfare. The term could also be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might imply that the Germans were known for their loud or boisterous nature (Oxford English Dictionary, 2010).\n\nTacitus' work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (circa 98 CE) offers valuable insights into the origins of the Germanic tribes. In it, he writes: \"I would regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse... Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany with its harsh climate, rugged terrain, and stern demeanor, unless it were their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, circa 98 CE). This perception of Germania as a land shunned by outsiders is reinforced by the Roman Empire's historical reluctance to colonize the region. While the Romans did venture into Germanic territories, they often returned to their empire, and the Germanic tribes maintained their independence, interacting with the Romans primarily through trade and military service (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "As I stood there, my gaze fell upon the scene before me, my mind processing the details without engaging in any emotional response. My thoughts fluttered in and out of my consciousness like leaves on a breeze, each one vanishing as quickly as it appeared. My mental state was a fluid, effortless experience, unencumbered by personal interpretations or biases.\n\nI had long been fascinated by the creative process, and as a child, I often dreamed of becoming an artist. Years ago, I had stumbled upon a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" which offered a unique approach to understanding the artistic process. The book outlined various techniques, including the use of a mental frame to simplify complex subjects. By placing a square boundary around a scene, the artist could focus on the essence of the image, stripping away extraneous details.\n\nAs I stood there, staring at the unassuming pile of waste before me, I couldn't help but think of this technique. The artist's frame seemed to elude me, however, and I found myself overwhelmed by the sheer mundane nature of the scene. The flush of memories from my art class came flooding back – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, and the vibrant colors of the Italian Renaissance masters. I had always aspired to create something beautiful, something worthy of being called art. In that moment, I felt a spark of inspiration, a sense that I was on the cusp of something creative.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the toilet handle, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to begin. The water swirled and churned, a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of my heart. I felt a sense of calm wash over me as I gazed down at the offending mass before me. My hand tightened its grip on the handle, and with a gentle motion, I began to work. The water continued to flow, a soothing serenade that accompanied my creative process.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, my thoughts turned to the task at hand. I stood tall, my feet shoulder-width apart, my grip on the toilet handle steady. My eyes never left the target, my focus unwavering. The water continued to flow, a relentless, calming force that seemed to carry away my doubts and fears. And then, with a quiet determination, I reached for the toilet paper roll, my hand wrapping around it like a grasp of a lifeline. The next few moments were a blur of movement and sound, a symphony of action and purpose.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage driving fatalities is a pressing concern that warrants attention and reform.  A multitude of factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  Research indicates that the adolescent brain is still maturing and lacks the necessary sophistication to navigate the complexities of driving.  Furthermore, inexperience plays a significant role in the high number of fatalities and accidents involving teenagers.  This inexperience is not only linked to a higher incidence of fatal crashes but also an increased likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt is also worth noting that teenagers tend to fare poorly when driving with their peers, a demographic often found in most driving situations.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlighted a significant correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response to this issue, several states have implemented measures to enhance teen driver safety, including provisional licenses with restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits.  However, these measures are merely temporary solutions and do not address the root cause of the problem.  As a group, young drivers are statistically less equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that the desire for thrill-seeking behavior is particularly prevalent among individuals under the age of 20.  This, coupled with the fact that many of these young drivers are still developing physically and cognitively, makes a strong case for delaying full licensure until the individual has matured further.  If we continue to issue unrestricted driver's licenses to teenagers, the number of fatalities is likely to continue to rise, with devastating consequences.\n\nA more effective approach would be to establish a uniform national standard that prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from operating a motor vehicle.  Schools could continue to provide driver education classes, and a provisional permit could be issued prior to granting a full driver's license, with a requirement for a certain number of supervised driving hours.  This could be modeled after existing state guidelines, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  By implementing a nationwide policy, we can better protect teen drivers across the country.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but rather a response to a pressing issue that requires a unified approach.  By taking a proactive stance, we can reduce the number of teen driving fatalities and create a safer road environment for all.",
            "During an expedition through the extensive film archives at the Library of Congress, I came across a collection of early Edison films, specifically those categorized as trick films, which spanned from 1895 to 1901. A total of fifteen films fell under this category, each showcasing the innovative use of editing techniques to create illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic qualities of the majority of these trick films, as well as identifying distinct deviations from typical conventions in a few later productions. The prevailing style of trick films at the turn of the century was characterized by its confinement to a set-bound, frontal proscenium, static camera, and reliance on long and medium shots, adhering to a strict one-shot-per-film approach. However, there were a few exceptions among early 20th-century trick films that dared to challenge these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking commonalities among trick films is their predilection for filming within a confined interior set, adhering to the traditional frontal proscenium structure. The camera remained stationary, never deviating from its fixed position to follow characters or objects. This composition drew inspiration from the theatre and, in the case of trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. A notable limitation inherent in this approach was the restriction of character movement to side-to-side motions, with minimal or no forward or backward movement towards the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side and moved horizontally, with the camera remaining steadfast in its position.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also dictated that shots predominantly consisted of long shots, with occasional medium shots. Close-ups were virtually nonexistent in the Edison catalog's trick films, a trait borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience would view the entire performance within the framed stage. In most early films, characters rarely moved towards the camera, thereby precluding the use of close-ups. The prevailing convention that one conceptual shot equated to one film led to a typical runtime of about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This constraint limited the narrative and dramatic potential of trick films, which mostly focused on concise, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching performances with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that a single \"shot\" in a trick film can actually comprise multiple joined shots, cleverly designed to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. A prime example of this can be seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, where a closer examination reveals the exact moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" commences, despite the film's conceptual unity as one shot in the viewer's perception.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a pioneering figure in the early American republic, was a steadfast advocate for limited government and the preservation of individual liberties. As a farmer and a politician, he was deeply committed to the values of agrarianism, which informed his views on governance and the role of the state. His unwavering dedication to the principles of self-sufficiency and rural life influenced his stance on issues of sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a system of government that would prioritize the rights and freedoms of its citizens. He was a strong proponent of the idea that natural rights are inherent and inalienable, and that their deprivation would have far-reaching consequences for the entire social fabric. In his view, the \"state of nature\" – a concept he often invoked to describe the primordial human condition – was characterized by the dominance of the strong over the weak, but he saw this as a scenario that should be mitigated in a civilized society.\n\nTo create a more just and equitable society, Taylor argued that a government must be designed to balance the inherent duality of human nature, acknowledging both its capacity for good and its propensity for evil. He was a firm believer in the idea that government, being a human institution, is susceptible to the same vices and virtues as its citizens. According to Taylor, a government founded on good principles would prioritize the protection of private property, the advancement of agriculture, and the regulation of capitalism, thereby ensuring a more equitable distribution of wealth and power.\n\nTaylor's understanding of human nature led him to conclude that self-interest was a fundamental driving force behind human behavior, but he distinguished between self-interest that serves the common good and that which exploits others. A good government, in his opinion, should strive to harness self-interest in the service of the greater good, while also monitoring its own influence to prevent the introduction of corrupting principles.\n\nIn line with his commitment to limited government, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, which he believed should be interpreted in a literal and uncompromising manner. He was wary of expansive federal power, which he saw as a threat to individual liberties and a recipe for despotism. However, he also recognized the importance of considering the intent behind the Constitution's framers, lest a simplistic interpretation lead to abuse and corruption. Moreover, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the foundational document of the United States, as it more explicitly enshrined the principles of sovereignty and the rights of the people.",
            "Upon examining the data in Figure 17, a notable decrease in commuter log submissions becomes apparent during the third month of the project. This decline, while disappointing, is somewhat understandable, particularly when considering the seasonal factors that may have influenced participation. As winter sets in at our New England campus, there is a natural decrease in bicycle and pedestrian traffic, which could account for a portion of the drop. Additionally, the end of the fall semester and the ensuing busy holiday season may have led to a decrease in overall campus activity, resulting in commuter logs slipping down the priority list for many individuals. Furthermore, the month-long break during the holidays may have reduced the need for students and faculty to physically attend campus, thus reducing the incentive to log their commutes.\n\nIt is also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project led to an initial surge in participation, which naturally tapered off over time. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week, a targeted campaign in March designed to reinvigorate the initiative and boost log submissions, which ultimately succeeded in achieving this goal.\n\nOne of the key challenges we faced in maintaining project momentum was the inherent difficulty of combating the natural decrease in engagement that occurs during periods of seasonal and academic transition. Furthermore, the cultural preference for driving personal vehicles poses a significant obstacle to alternative commuting initiatives. To mitigate this, we introduced incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed to be effective in encouraging participation. However, it is intriguing to consider whether larger, more substantial prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, may have had an even greater impact on participation. By increasing the value of prizes over time, we may have been able to sustain engagement levels and avoid the decline experienced during the project. The consistency of our incentive structure, while effective initially, may not have been enough to counteract the decline in participation, particularly during the holiday season.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) offers investors a unique hybrid model, combining the diversification benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a single stock. Like its index fund counterpart, an ETF allows investors to tap into a broad market segment, but its exchange-listed status enables buyers to purchase and sell shares like individual stocks. This flexibility comes with several attractive benefits, including the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and acquire as few as one share in a transaction. A key advantage of ETFs over mutual funds lies in their significantly lower expense ratios. However, this convenience comes at a cost, as investors incur trading commissions on ETF transactions, just like those associated with individual stock trades.\n\nETFs boast an extensive array of investment options, catering to diverse investor preferences. Nevertheless, astute investors must critically evaluate the touted benefits, such as diversification, to determine their actual value and extent. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, comprising 63.58% of its total assets, to assess whether a single ETF can provide comparable benefits to a diversified portfolio of the constituent stocks, and whether an alternative configuration might yield a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we have selected the top 10 holdings, which collectively represent the majority of the ETF's assets. By using the current asset allocation as a basis, we can estimate the contributions of each stock to a hypothetical portfolio's risk and return, should it consist entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The accompanying chart provides the calculated Beta and return values for the top 10 holdings.\n\nA cursory examination of the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Notably, the Beta of this hypothetical portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with reduced volatility. However, it is essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo investigate this further, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation. This analysis will help determine whether the performance differences between the ETF and its top 10 holdings are statistically distinguishable.",
            "The poem \"Dream-Land\" is notable for its unique incorporation of the term \"Thulé,\" a concept that has its roots in the works of Virgil. However, an often-overlooked precursor to Virgil's use of the term can be found in the writings of Karl J. Arndt, who explores the shared literary influences between Edgar Allan Poe and Goethe in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon.\" Arndt's analysis highlights a possible case of literary borrowing, where Poe draws inspiration from Goethe's works.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a prominent literary figure, renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832. Within \"Faust,\" a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" presents a narrative of a king whose wife's passing sets him on a path of tragic introspection. This poem, which explores themes of grief and mortality, bears a striking resemblance to Poe's depiction of a desolate Thulé in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nIn \"The King of Thulé,\" the monarch's descent into despair is precipitated by the loss of his wife, a theme that echoes in Poe's own work. The narrative of the king's downfall, marked by his excessive drinking and eventual demise, serves as a poignant commentary on the human experience. Interestingly, the similarities between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible connection between the two poems, with the latter serving as a dark mirror to the former.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in multiple works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" underscores his familiarity with Goethe's writing. The fact that Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" as bookends adds weight to the idea that these poems are interconnected. A closer reading of \"Dream-Land\" reveals a landscape of desolation and loss, which is strikingly reminiscent of the king's experience in \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it is likely that he was well-versed in Goethe's work. While this connection is not direct, it is clear that Poe was influenced by Goethe's writing, as evident in the numerous reproductions of Goethe's work that were circulating during Poe's time. The interplay between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" serves as a testament to the power of literary borrowing and the enduring influence of great works on subsequent writers.",
            "Under the jurisdiction of California law, a customer who suffered an injury after slipping and falling on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store may potentially be awarded punitive damages if they can demonstrate that the store manager's actions displayed a reckless disregard for the potential risks associated with the situation.\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages without further consideration. In order to establish a valid claim for punitive damages, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a deliberate and wanton disregard for the potential harm that could arise from their conduct. Furthermore, they must also show that the defendant's behavior was egregious or despicable.\n\nPalmer may argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given the history of multiple slip-and-fall incidents at D&D Markets in the months leading up to Palmer's accident. Despite this knowledge, Martin chose not to address the issue. Additionally, Palmer may point to the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, and Martin did not take adequate steps to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about a spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on a break and could not attend to customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, but he gave the same response. Thirty minutes after the initial report, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining the possibility of filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that does not arise from a contractual agreement if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it involves a deliberate disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant is aware of the potential risks associated with their actions and deliberately chooses to ignore them, leading to harm.",
            "Approximately four years ago, I had the opportunity to explore the complexities of Islam through a course at CBC.  One of the most contentious topics we discussed in the class was the notion of Islam as a potentially hostile faith.  In light of the events that have transpired since 9/11, I believe this question is more pertinent than ever.  Observing the shift in the media's portrayal of Islam and extremism has been striking.  In 2001, a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has a Muslim heritage, would have been unimaginable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a subject that continues to fascinate me.  My understanding of his history, as gleaned from various accounts, reveals a paradoxical figure.  I once believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam through conquest and coercion, but the biography presents a more nuanced portrayal – that of a misunderstood and humbled individual who inspired people to seek him out.  This dichotomy has left me with a multitude of questions about the Prophet's true nature.\n\nNotably, there are intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the reported miracles of Muhammad.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying food to feed a group of forty men.  This style of storytelling has led me to wonder if the writers intended to convey Muhammad as a humble, self-effacing figure who required no proof, but rather lived a life of truth and wonder.  This narrative approach has a profound impact on my perception of the story, as it subtly downplays the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous anecdotes that appear to serve as testimonials to the validity of Islam.  However, I find it problematic that many of these accounts are secondhand, passed down through multiple individuals.  The intention behind these stories may be to provide evidence of the truth, but it ultimately undermines their credibility, making them seem suspicious and lacking in authenticity.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a virtuous, compassionate, and wise individual.  Historical records, however, cast doubt on this characterization, and I am left wondering if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and convictions of Jesus, as well as the beliefs he advocated for during his lifetime, have been largely overlooked in the development of Christian thought that emerged after his passing.  From a broader historical perspective, it is evident that Christianity has gradually drifted further away from its origins over time.  As we navigate the complexities of today's world, an increased awareness and a trend towards progressive thinking are becoming increasingly apparent.  While those who adhere to traditional values and resist any deviation from established doctrine will undoubtedly continue to exist, their numbers may ultimately prove insufficient to significantly influence the broader trajectory of the faith.  In the years to come, a growing awareness of history among Christians will likely lead to a heightened desire to distinguish between the core principles of the faith and the additional ideas and dogma that have accumulated over time.  This process may take several generations or even centuries, but the eventual outcome is unavoidable: Christianity will undergo a significant reversal, gradually returning to its original form.  A movement will likely gain momentum, shedding the layers of doctrine that have accumulated over time, much like a clock rewinding itself, until only the fundamental principles imparted by Jesus remain.  As this trend takes hold in the United States and Europe, it will influence large numbers of people, leading to a return to a simpler, more authentic form of worship, one that closely resembles the faith as Jesus knew it.  The institution of the church will continue to play a significant role in guiding this process.  However, this reversal will also result in a decrease in the diversity of Christian thought and practice, as the theological clock unwinds, leading to a more uniform understanding of the faith.  Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and other divisions, we will witness an increasing convergence of beliefs and practices.  Human history is replete with examples of such reversals.  For instance, the Roman Empire, once hostile to Christianity, eventually became a bastion of the faith.  Similarly, the United States has undergone a significant shift from racism and oppression to greater inclusivity and equality.  In the future, Christianity will experience a similar reversion, one that will involve a return to the source of the faith and a reduction in diversity.  It is essential to note that one key factor that will facilitate this process is the reevaluation of Jesus' words as metaphorical and not literal statements of fact.  In order to understand the evolution of Christianity, we must look back to its earliest roots.  If we examine the historical record, we find that, prior to Jesus' lifetime, the Jewish faith was the primary theological influence behind Christianity.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core tenets of Judaism, including monotheism, a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were well-established.  However, the Jewish population was not united, with various groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people existing side by side.",
            "One of the primary concerns expressed in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle revolves around the innate self-interest of human beings. It is argued that deep down, individuals primarily focus on bettering their own lives and overlook the well-being of those less fortunate. This theme is demonstrated through various characters and settings in the novel. \n\nOn one hand, factory owners and managers exemplify this self-interest, striving to expand their businesses without regard for the consequences. The narrative highlights the damaging effects of their relentless pursuit of progress. Sinclair vividly describes the pollution caused by the factories, underscoring the owners' disregard for the environment and the people affected by it. The image of the smoke-filled atmosphere and the overwhelming pollution showcases the devastating impact of their actions.\n\nMoreover, the owners and managers care little for their employees, treating them as mere commodities to be exploited for profit. They prioritize profits over people, as seen in the following passage: \"A sense of envy and hostility pervades the entire community, devoid of any loyalty or decency.\" The employees are subjected to grueling working conditions and sudden layoffs, with little to no support or compensation. During the time period depicted in the novel, workers had limited protections, allowing the factory owners to operate with impunity.\n\nThe novel implies that the workers, worn down by their circumstances, were expected to endure the harsh conditions without any assistance. The lack of organizations or agencies providing aid to the working class left them vulnerable. While unions were formed, they often exploited the workers, prioritizing profits over their well-being. The workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and dependence, likened to a system of slavery. As Sinclair writes, \"In this population, mostly foreign and low-income, people are perpetually on the brink of starvation, relying on the whims of men as ruthless as the old slave traders. Under these circumstances, immorality becomes as inevitable and widespread as it was under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In literature, authors often employ various techniques to elicit a particular emotional response from their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby, exemplifies this notion, as he skillfully employs a range of techniques to convey meaning and create a specific atmosphere. One notable technique he uses is the juxtaposition of words to generate a particular connotation. For instance, Fitzgerald frequently combines adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways to create a distinct aura surrounding a subject. He also assigns abstract meanings to symbols and utilizes them to convey these interpretations. This technique is particularly evident in his use of colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops and employs the meanings associated with these colors to create a particular emotional resonance.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color symbolism is a striking example of this technique. He establishes the connotations of white and gray early in the novel, often associating them with concepts such as uniformity, elegance, and age. The former is often linked to refinement and higher social status, while the latter is associated with a sense of wear and familiarity. This interpretation is established through repeated instances of these colors in relation to various characters and settings. For example, Daisy and Jordan are frequently dressed in white, as seen in \"they were dressed in white\" (8), while Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party. Tom, on the other hand, is often depicted wearing a \"white shirt\" (36), while Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The sole exception to this trend is when Nick describes Gatsby's party, where the hall is \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40), emphasizing the stark contrast with the dominant use of white and gray.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying these colors to common, everyday subjects. When Nick commutes to work, he traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and the names on his timetable are written in \"gray\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), exemplifying the uniformity Fitzgerald aims to convey. He also uses these colors to describe ordinary people and places, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" (27) who sells dogs.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of white and gray, Fitzgerald employs these colors to signify a lack of significance or uniformity in the characters. This is particularly evident in his depiction of Daisy. Following a period of minimal use of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them in relation to Daisy, describing her as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74). This portrayal serves to undermine her character, reducing her to a uniform, desired object in Gatsby's eyes. This technique is further reinforced by the use of gray to describe Daisy's fur collar (18) and her appearance in a white dress (115) before the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "The San Diego County area boasts a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant climate. The region's diverse crop selection includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. There is a significant demand for locally sourced, organic produce, with many residents seeking out community-supported agriculture options. This trend has led to a waiting list for some local organizations offering these services. Organic dairy and egg production are also in high demand. Some farms in the area provide guided tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, thereby enabling landowners to benefit from government programs while preserving natural habitats and generating additional revenue streams.\n\nNot only can organic farming fill a lucrative niche market, but it also contributes to increased biodiversity in the region. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water allows for a more diverse range of plant and animal species to thrive. However, organic farming often comes with higher operational costs. For instance, organic farming requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds without the use of synthetic chemicals, and losses can be greater than those experienced with conventional farming methods. Additionally, small-scale organic farms often lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nBeyond the specific practices associated with organic farming, land managers may also implement other beneficial techniques that support local wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotational grazing, invasive species removal, and strategic management of vegetation to create specific habitats or open spaces. These efforts can be resource-intensive and may incur additional labor costs. As a result, a landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profitability and environmental quality.\n\nThe chosen property is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, California, near the town of Potrero. The 160-acre parcel is comprised of a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is currently being considered for inclusion in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan encompasses over a hundred species, including several that are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher, as well as species that are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production during the intervening years.\n\nI selected a property from a real estate listing and researched relevant government programs to explore options for mitigating costs and promoting wildlife-friendly practices. As a model for a local farm, I identified an organic farm in the same area that serves as a potential example of what a landowner in this scenario might strive to achieve.",
            "Effective negotiation often relies on a nuanced understanding of the cultural context in which it takes place. This involves recognizing that culture is a multifaceted and dynamic entity, shaped by a complex interplay of factors. Rather than reducing cultures to simplistic stereotypes, such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating,\" negotiators should strive to grasp the specific cultural nuances that influence decision-making and interactions.\n\nTo achieve this, it's essential to delve beyond broad generalizations and explore the deeper significance of a culture. This may involve studying its history, examining its values and biases, and acknowledging the unique experiences and perspectives that shape its members' interactions. By doing so, negotiators can develop a more empathetic and informed approach, better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural communication.\n\nWhen engaging with unfamiliar cultural contexts, it's natural to draw comparisons with one's own cultural background. However, this can also lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Instead, negotiators should aim to approach each culture with an open mind, suspending assumptions and judgments to appreciate its distinct character. This requires a willingness to adapt and be flexible, particularly when facing a weaker bargaining position or operating in unfamiliar territory.\n\nInterestingly, corporate culture can be a significant aspect of this dynamic, even within a single nation. Companies often develop their unique corporate identity, shaped by factors such as work-life balance, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some organizations prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed atmosphere. Similarly, employee dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic initiatives can all reveal the nuances of a company's culture.\n\nMoreover, values play a crucial role in shaping a culture's underlying dynamics. Understanding the values that drive a culture – such as the importance of saving face, communal harmony, or hard-driving competitiveness – can significantly inform negotiation strategies. By recognizing these values, negotiators can tailor their approach to resonate with their counterpart's cultural context, increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes.\n\nUltimately, effective negotiation requires a deep appreciation for the complexities of cultural differences. By taking the time to understand the underlying values, biases, and nuances of a culture, negotiators can develop a more effective and empathetic approach, better equipped to navigate the challenges of cross-cultural communication.",
            "The notion of divine non-existence has been a subject of debate throughout history. A notable passage encapsulating this concept is found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This assertion is echoed by both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two prominent thinkers whose arguments for the existence of God are the focus of our discussion. To facilitate a meaningful comparison, we will assume that both philosophers are arguing in favor of the God of the Bible, as any alternative conceptions of a divine being would complicate our analysis. While both thinkers present valid points, a closer examination reveals that neither provides a comprehensive foundation for their respective arguments.\n\nTo illustrate this point, we will first examine St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning is based on the idea that understanding of God can be found within the human mind. He posits that the notion of God's non-existence is inconceivable, implying that the existence of God can be deduced through introspection. This approach suggests that empirical evidence is not necessary, as the truth of God's existence is perceived as self-evident. This perspective aligns with the concept of faith, which is often associated with the acceptance of truth that may not be readily verifiable through empirical means.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach, arguing that the existence of God can be proven through reason and evidence alone. This perspective has implications for evangelism, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without reliance on faith, instead using logic as a persuasive tool. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments for the existence of God, each focusing on the inherent necessity of God's existence. He illustrates this point using analogies, such as the missing puzzle piece, where the existence of the missing piece can be inferred through logical reasoning, even if it is not directly observable.",
            "A pivotal figure, later known as the Buddha, emerged during the fifth or sixth century BCE. This individual's transformative journey from a life of worldly attachments to attainment of enlightenment laid the groundwork for the development of Buddhism. As the centuries have passed, the faith has undergone significant evolution, manifesting in diverse forms such as the Theravada tradition, which has taken root in countries like Sri Lanka. There, the annual water-cutting ceremony, though not directly outlined in the teachings of the Buddha, holds spiritual significance for both monastic and lay practitioners. These adaptations, ranging from superficial customs to the fundamental tenants of the doctrine, demonstrate the dynamic nature of the Theravada Buddhist community. The community's evolving principles, influenced by both internal and external forces, have been shaped by a complex interplay of factors.\n\nInternal and external forces, key concepts in this discussion, warrant clarification. An internal force is one that originates from within the Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members. Conversely, external forces arise from non-Buddhist influences. Hostile forces are those that intentionally or unintentionally harm the community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, in contrast, aim to neither harm nor assist the community, although their actions may have unintended consequences. These definitions will be employed throughout this examination.\n\nTo grasp the essence of Theravada Buddhism, it is crucial to explore its foundational doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, comprising the Tripitaka, is comprised of three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, encompassing the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central to these notions are the concepts of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these tenets is essential for transcending Sansara, the cycle of rebirth and death, which perpetuates itself ceaselessly. Enlightenment also brings an end to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a framework for guiding laypeople's lives, including the five precepts (non-harming, honesty, non-stealing, chastity, and sobriety). For monks, a more extensive set of rules governs their behavior. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the Four Noble Truths. Firstly, the truth of suffering (Dukkha); secondly, the truth that attachment leads to suffering; and thirdly, the truth that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The 57-year-long animosity between the United States and Mexico, spanning from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145), exemplifies a classic case of a border nation rivalry. The conflict reached a boiling point during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States emerge victorious and secure significant territorial gains, including Texas and the American Southwest. While the war marked the peak of the rivalry, other clashes between the two nations persisted, finally subsiding in the years leading up to World War I.\n\nA fundamental aspect of this prolonged rivalry stemmed from fundamental differences in values, customs, and traditions, as well as conflicting material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This scenario is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship; many nations sharing borders often experience similar tensions due to divergent interests and priorities. As David M. Pletcher (1977) noted, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-standing American foreign policy challenges\" (p. 41). Geographical proximity has contributed to the enduring nature of these rivalries, particularly in the case of Mexico and Cuba, which have historically been at odds with the US.\n\nThe rift between the two nations was also fueled by religious differences, a common denominator in many historical conflicts. Sally Frahm (2001) observed that, \"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, much like their twentieth-century stance against fascism and communism\" (p. 86). This ideological struggle, however, was not merely a disagreement over political systems but rather a clash of values rooted in religious preferences. The legacy of distrust inherited from their colonial past – the English and Spanish empires – hindered the establishment of harmonious diplomatic relations between the US and Mexico.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period, with the majority centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and frontier conflicts. The problems of banditry and lawlessness along the border were eventually alleviated through increased military presence on both sides (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) attributed the decline of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the US and the shift in American ambitions, which transitioned from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110) in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "It's been a decade and a half since an unforeseen health crisis suddenly derailed my life's trajectory. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career choice driven by my childhood experiences of uncertainty and insecurity. The message that resonated with me throughout my formative years was that a stable career in a field like nursing would always be in demand, providing a sense of stability and financial security. However, I had secretly aspired to be a scientist or journalist, perhaps a fusion of both.\n\nDespite my passion for those fields, I chose nursing, and here I am, 15 years later, unable to work and living off of disability benefits. The financial struggles have been relentless, leaving me with little to call my own. Yet, it's the kindness of my family and a select few friends that has allowed me to navigate these challenges. In the face of adversity, I've come to realize the importance of humility and knowing when to ask for help.\n\nMy experience has taught me that life's unpredictable nature means that we will inevitably face emergencies, whether big or small. Preparation is essential, but it's equally crucial to acknowledge that some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I firmly believe that the United States would benefit from a shift in values, moving away from an overreliance on the government and towards a culture of mutual support and trust.\n\nThe notion of \"rugged individualism\" is often touted as the core American value, but history suggests that our ancestors' success during trying times was largely due to the collective efforts of their communities. The pioneers who traversed the American wilderness in wagon trains didn't achieve their goals in isolation. Instead, they relied on one another for support and shared resources.\n\nWhile preparing for the unexpected is wise, it's equally important to cultivate a sense of community. I've assembled a basic disaster preparedness kit, complete with essential supplies like first aid kits, water purification tablets, and protective gear. However, I also believe that building relationships with those around me is just as crucial. If you have the means, consider investing in a small garden or a wood-burning stove – but don't underestimate the value of getting to know your neighbors.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a complex and multifaceted issue. Despite D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that scientists still struggle to quantify the intricacies of organic forms, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of evolution. Recent studies have applied this approach to the development and diversification of mollusk skeletons, with notable contributions from researchers such as Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our investigation explores the potential of mathematical modeling, combined with experimental research, to elucidate the mechanisms governing the pace and direction of evolutionary development in the genus Prunum. We utilized X-ray imaging to identify quantitative characteristics that could be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies, which were then inputted into the CerioShell software program developed by Stone in 1995. By generating hypothetical shell forms, we aimed to define the boundaries within which morphological variation could occur in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary processes in this group.\n\nThe shell of a mollusk can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional tube that undergoes a continuous transformation through 360 degrees of space over time. This process can be visualized as a series of coiled spirals, known as whorls, which revolve around a central axis referred to as the columella. The columella traverses the central column of the shell, while the whorls are separated by continuous lines called sutures. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and the largest whorl, typically the body whorl, occupies the outermost position in most shells. The spire consists of all whorls except the final one, with the apex representing the terminal point and the base situated at the opposite end. The animal emerges through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards, is commonly employed. A systematic method for counting whorls involves examining the shell from the apical view and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this reference point, estimating to a quarter of a whorl when necessary.\n\nThe shell can also be perceived as a series of interconnected apertures that traverse time and space as the mollusk builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture through coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, a trajectory can be mapped. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing for the manipulation of parameters and modification of the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality over the past decade has been stagnant. Despite making strides in meeting Millennium Development Goals, such as achieving water and sanitation targets, the country is struggling to make significant improvements in child and maternal health, which is essential for meeting its target goals by 2015.  The multifaceted reasons behind this stagnation will be explored below, highlighting the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on programmatic interventions.\n\nNotably, Indonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of deliveries now meeting this criterion. However, this metric encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, resulting in a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhaging.  Consequently, the progress made in this area is somewhat misleading, underscoring the need for further action.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases among children under five treated by a healthcare professional, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a concerning trend across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%.  This rate is particularly concerning, as the disparity between urban and rural areas is striking, with a rate of 7% in urban settings compared to just 2% in rural areas.  This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with a clear bias towards urban areas.  Another concern is vertical equity, as there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the disadvantaged are facing significant barriers to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nConsidering the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how to most effectively address the lack of access to services.  Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize developing targeted program-specific approaches or strengthening the overarching health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While program-specific approaches have the advantage of being more focused and manageable, with faster results, they also have several drawbacks.  A significant drawback is that investing heavily in a particular area can divert resources away from other areas, leading to a shortage of human resources and duplication of services.  For instance, the influx of international funding for HIV/AIDS has had a ripple effect on the family planning sector, leading to a shift in focus and resources.",
            "The Victorian literary canon is distinguished by its meticulous attention to nuance and its preoccupation with the elite social strata of the era.  However, two outliers within this tradition are Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Both novels diverge from the conventional mold by incorporating elements of mystery and the uncanny, which serves to enrich the characterization and provide a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nA pivotal passage from Dickens' work exemplifies this phenomenon: \"And now, a multitude of perplexing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to be moving between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated dispute; their words echoed in his ears, and when he regained his composure, he found himself conversing with them. Sudden gunshots shattered the air, and a cacophony of cries and shouts erupted. Lights danced before his eyes, and he was whisked away by an unseen force. Amidst this maelstrom, a nagging sense of pain persisted, gnawing at his consciousness.\"\n\nThese novels frequently employ dream sequences or trance-like states to convey the mystery, though the context and purpose vary in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic events often offer insight into Oliver's inner struggles, his emotional anguish, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of Oliver's shooting in chapter 28 is a striking example of this technique. The scene is rendered in vivid detail, as if a dream, while Oliver desperately seeks help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as the precarious state of his health, which is starkly evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms Oliver, numbing his senses, and he is borne away by an unseen force, his despair revisited, now a constant companion, intertwined with fear rather than surprise. This event begs the question of whose agency lies behind Oliver's misfortune, as it is clear that it was not his own. Furthermore, this incident contributes to the narrative's portrayal of Oliver's growing sense of defeat, suggesting that he has been broken by the influence of old Fagin, forcing him to accept his despair and diminishing his capacity for resistance.\n\nA haunting passage from Wuthering Heights further illustrates this concept: \"The day passed – day; it was forgotten as soon as it arrived – and night fell once more; a night so oppressive in its stillness and fleeting in its duration.\"",
            "I recall a pivotal experience from several years ago when I worked as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary school students. My primary focus was on assisting students with their academic struggles, particularly in English and reading. One student, a young boy named Adrian, stood out to me. Although he spoke fluent English, he exhibited peculiar difficulties with reading, which puzzled me at first. I hypothesized that his challenges lay not in comprehension but rather in recognizing written English. This epiphany struck me when I met his mother, who spoke only Spanish, and we managed to communicate using my limited Spanish skills. This experience illuminated the complexities of language barriers in education, particularly in regions like California.\n\nBy sharing this story, I aim to highlight the pressing issue of language barriers in schools and its subtleties. Even students with native-like fluency in a language can face significant obstacles when confronted with reading materials. The problem is multifaceted, and its solutions cannot be simplified. In Adrian's case, targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved beneficial. However, for non-native English speakers, the solution is more intricate.\n\nThe dual language system, a widely debated topic, presents a promising approach. Studies have shown that children in bilingual education programs perform better academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation, I argue that such programs can benefit all students, not just those with Spanish as their first language. To implement this effectively, we must consider several factors. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical, we can provide bilingual support staff to assist in the classroom. This could include tutors, educational aids, or other specialized resources. By combining these measures, we can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment for all students.\n\nBy acknowledging the complexities of language barriers and embracing innovative solutions, we can better support students like Adrian and promote academic success across the board. The key lies in integration, not isolation, of various approaches to address this pressing issue.",
            "As individuals, we've long been confronted with the notion of an existence beyond our own understanding. This abstract concept is frequently discussed in various settings – from Sunday school to temple services or introspective self-discovery. Many people instinctively adopt the faith systems imparted by their parents, while others reject these traditions outright, doubting the existence of anything beyond their own personal realities. Our perspectives on spirituality evolve as we navigate different value structures, often finding new meaning through our individual experiences. We seek illumination in the darkness, striving to break free from the shadows and step into the light.\n\nMy recollection of a conversation with my father is vivid. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain drumming against the tin roof. The downpour cascaded from the gutters, submerging the plants along the porch's edge. My father, lost in thought, gazed out into the rain with a contemplative expression, his eyes avoiding direct contact. His physical appearance had changed over the past few months – his clothes hung loosely on his frame, and his hair had thinned significantly. The air was heavy with unspoken emotions as I hesitated to discuss my impending loss. Instead, I opted to share a moment of physical comfort, embracing him and sitting closer to his side as we both gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nTragedy struck just a few months later, on the fifth day after my 22nd birthday, in December. The grueling treatments had prolonged his life, but failed to alleviate his suffering. I grappled with the concept of a higher power, questioning its benevolence in allowing my father to endure such pain. Alone in the darkness, I refrained from prayer, having lost faith in a deity that seemed to have abandoned me.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness my father's passing. Instead, I chose to recall his life and not his death, focusing on the memories of how he lived rather than how he left. I knew my father better than anyone, and I believed he would have wanted me to cherish the time we had, rather than being present during his final moments. For three days, I retreated to the safety of my bed, waiting for the news that would change everything.\n\nThe silence was deafening, as the phone remained still and unresponsive.",
            "The notion of the Gothic Novel as a genre is often paradoxical, embodying both the old and the new. This dichotomy is astutely observed by Ian Watt, who describes it as an \"oxymoron\" in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has been subject to a range of interpretations, from dismissive critiques to enthusiastic acclaim, with some seeing it as lacking depth and others extolling its capacity to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The pioneering work of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto played a significant role in shaping the Gothic genre, drawing on both ancient and modern narrative traditions to create a novel that blended the old with the new. Walpole's use of theatrical elements and modern storytelling techniques enabled him to craft a new form of literary expression that he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The genre relies heavily on references to medieval theatre, architecture, and cultural heritage, which were seen as archaic and unsophisticated in the context of emerging modernity.\n\nThe fusion of traditional and modern elements allowed Gothic literature to endure and adapt to changing times, becoming both outdated and new to readers across different eras. One of the key features of the Gothic genre is its representation of chivalry, a medieval concept that emphasized the development of a noble knight. This ideal, characterized by bravery, honor, and competence, is a recurring theme in Gothic literature, particularly in The Castle of Otranto. The chivalric code serves as a means of nostalgia and idealization of the past, foreshadowing the emergence of Romanticism. In Walpole's time, this nostalgia was likely influenced by his disillusionment with the present, which he saw as lacking in the values and morality of the past. This is reflected in the character of Frederic, who embodies the chivalric ideals and is described as a prince who has suffered and been shaped by his experiences.\n\nWalpole's portrayal of Frederic is a masterful blend of traditional chivalric imagery, including his status as a prince, his tragic past, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. This portrayal is an early example of the Gothic trope of excess, which would become a hallmark of the genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management encompasses a multifaceted array of processes that govern the trajectory of goods from the initial customer order to the final stages of product distribution. The term itself was first coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a forward-thinking consultant, who described the intricate process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer demands in a timely and efficient manner. Central to this process are six critical components that serve as the cornerstone of a well-structured supply chain: production, supply, inventory management, location optimization, transportation logistics, and information exchange.\n\nProduction is the foundational step in the supply chain process, setting the tone for the entire operation. It involves a thorough examination of customer requirements, which can be gleaned from market analysis. By understanding market trends and customer needs, managers can make informed decisions regarding product offerings and production volumes. The choice of production location is also crucial, taking into account factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. To ensure a seamless production process, managers must prioritize scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance, recognizing that even the smallest detail can have far-reaching consequences for the company's bottom line. Efficient planning and execution are essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nSupply is the second key element in the supply chain management framework. It involves making strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may opt to outsource certain processes to external partners, leveraging their specialized skills and expertise to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs. This strategic approach allows companies to tap into the strengths of various divisions, each with its unique equipment, workforce, and specialties. By doing so, they can optimize their operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.",
            "A disturbing message scrawled on a makeshift sign in Burma, a Southeast Asian nation, has caught the attention of passerby. Ellen Page, known for her poignant portrayal in the film \"Juno,\" stands solitary on a street corner, the cardboard placard held high above her head with a bold, black Sharpie inscription. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been ruled by a ruling junta since 1962, following a military coup d'état. A significant turning point in the country's history occurred in 2007, when a wave of public protests broke out, led by a large number of Burmese monks. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these demonstrations drew international attention, sparking a violent crackdown by the military junta, which targeted monasteries and rounded up foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who lost his life while covering a street protest in September 2007.\n\nThis distressing event is not an isolated incident. The desire for complete control and suppression of dissent has been a recurring theme throughout human history. From ancient civilizations to modern-day governments, the pursuit of absolute power has led to numerous tragic consequences. In the past, Roman emperors claimed divine authority to govern their societies, while in Japan, the emperor is considered a deity, believed to guide his people towards prosperity through technological advancements and spiritual practices. In the present day, high-ranking officials engage in confidential meetings with influential leaders, highlighting the complex relationships between power and governance.\n\nHistorical examples of such authoritarianism include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered against the government's oppressive rule. Reports of the event's death toll vary significantly, with official estimates ranging from 200 to 300, while eyewitness accounts suggest a much higher number, between 2,000 and 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderates, is another harrowing example. The atrocities committed during WWII, including the persecution of Jews under the Nazi regime, are also a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on the jazz genre stems in large part from his remarkable longevity and the resultant influence on his musical ensemble. While his piano contributions may not be immediately apparent in the selections for this assignment, his compositional prowess stands out for its ability to showcase the unique talents of individual band members. Through his expert crafting of musical frameworks, Ellington empowered soloists to improvise freely while also composing intricate, tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted the distinct qualities of each band member. Consequently, the collective sound of his orchestra became a hallmark of his work, yielding coherent and original musical textures that suited each piece uniquely. \n\nAs an authority on Ellington's contributions to jazz, the Grove Music dictionary notes his innovative use of voice as a sonic instrument. A notable example of this can be seen in Creole Love Call, which utilizes voice to add depth and timbre without the constraint of lyrics. By doing so, Ellington demonstrates his skill in complementing the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. This deliberate, twelve-bar blues piece, comprising six choruses, exemplifies his approach:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between the vocalist and reeds, characterized by a smooth, melodic introduction and a rougher, more dramatic conclusion.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the melodic theme, incorporating extended blue notes to add emotional depth.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a syncopated piano phrase that underscores the emotional intensity.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble recaptures the essence of the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, marked by the reeds taking the lead in a call-and-response sequence, accompanied by stop-time syncopation from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the opening structure, with the vocalist adopting a growl technique, soloing as if an instrument.\nA final, brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant, novel conclusion courtesy of a trombone.\n\nEllington's incorporation of voice as a means of adding tonal dimension to his compositions is a recurring motif throughout his work.\n\nOne year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combined his skill in crafting tightly orchestrated pieces with his keen sense of tonal color in Hot and Bothered. The call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing masterfully combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, yielding a rich, complementary sound. This approach is further refined in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "There was a void within her that had long defied satisfaction. It began to take shape when she was 14, during the tumultuous transition into adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the yearning still lingered, now with a distinct desire for human connection over abstract concepts. Yet, she found herself disinterested in the prospect of romantic relationships, as if an invisible barrier had been erected, shielding her from the affections of others. Some had attempted to breach this barrier, with awkward and often unsuccessful overtures, but none had managed to pique her interest. She often found herself questioning this phenomenon, searching for a plausible explanation, but no theory seemed satisfactory.\n\nOrdinarily, her home was a tranquil haven. Her parents were level-headed individuals, rarely engaging in conflict with one another or with her. However, they did occasionally disagree about her independent nature and free-spirited personality, which often clashed with their more subdued approach to life. Her parents' calm demeanor was a stark contrast to her own effervescent personality, yet it was her likable and kind nature that had earned her a special place in their hearts.\n\nToday, however, was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, a sudden, high-pitched cry pierced the air, followed by the unmistakable sound of her mother's voice. She hastened into the kitchen, alarm coursing through her veins as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" Upon entering the room, she was met with the unexpected sight of her mother lying on the floor, wincing in pain as she repeatedly muttered, \"Ow\" in short, labored breaths. Her daughter rushed to her mother's side, placing a supporting hand on her arm, and asked, \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were hushed and strained, and her daughter sensed the gravity of the situation. \"Okay, Mom, just point me in the right direction,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the growing unease within her. Her mother's directions were clear, and at that moment, her daughter was grateful for the physical training she had undergone. With a sense of determination, she lifted her mother into the car and set her in the backseat.\n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere, heavy with the scent of disinfectant and the faint tang of illness, seemed to amplify the sense of foreboding that hung in the air. But her daughter's anxiety was superseded by her concern for her mother's well-being. She hurriedly escorted her mother to the hospital bed, where a team of medical professionals quickly sprang into action, their faces etched with worry. A gurney was summoned, and her mother was carefully transferred onto it. As the doctors began their assessment, her daughter was left to sit, her anxiety simmering just beneath the surface.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had suffered an accident while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet. She had fallen off a step stool.",
            "The objective of this investigation was to investigate the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, quantified by an alternate Mediterranean diet score, and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. This study focused on the modified Mediterranean diet, which is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, including plant proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as a reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also permitted in this dietary pattern.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated an inverse association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, as well as an intervention trial that showed the Mediterranean diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles in obese individuals. However, prior research has not specifically examined the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke mortality.\n\nThis observational study followed a cohort of 74,886 female nurses, aged 38-63 years, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a large-scale prospective study of female nurses in 11 US states. The study collected data over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2004, with participants completing six food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to assess their dietary intake. The FFQs were validated through various methods, including medical and hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nThe study controlled for potential confounding variables, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, by adjusting for these factors in the analysis. To minimize random variation in individual data and capture long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated from the repeated FFQs. \n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal outcomes. The results indicated that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were documented. Women in the highest quintile of alternate Mediterranean diet score exhibited a reduced risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked the onset of a severe economic downturn in the United States. As the housing market imploded, unemployment skyrocketed, and many major corporations found themselves on the brink of collapse. The lasting impact of this crisis necessitates an examination of its origins and potential solutions. In essence, the housing market collapse was precipitated by a combination of misguided policy decisions and a fragile financial infrastructure. Specifically, banks and financial institutions were incentivized to issue subprime loans, which were then repackaged and sold as complex financial instruments. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the resulting financial chaos was disproportionately borne by the institutions that had invested in these securities.\n\nA crucial turning point occurred in 1999, during the Clinton administration, when the president sought to bolster his popularity ahead of a re-election bid. In an effort to achieve this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, creating an environment conducive to the subprime crisis that would unfold in the following years. Notably, Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted in 1999 that this course of action could have disastrous consequences, stating that Fannie Mae's \"phenomenal growth in profits\" was being fueled by a \"government-subsidized corporation\" that was \"under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people.\" Holmes astutely recognized the potential risks of this approach, warning that the company \"may run into trouble in an economic downturn.\"\n\nThe structural vulnerabilities of the housing market played a significant role in perpetuating the crisis. The proliferation of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) created a complex web of interconnected financial assets. This, in turn, led to a situation in which U.S. households and financial markets became heavily reliant on the housing market, rendering them acutely vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in prices. Ultimately, the housing bubble burst, causing widespread financial institutions to bear the brunt of the losses. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, representing approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. The financial fallout was severe, with Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch being acquired at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers being dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley being forced to convert to commercial banks subject to stricter regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "The Art of Disclosing: A Cautionary Tale for the Overexpository\n\nIt's a familiar phenomenon – that moment in a story where the writer's creative wings begin to unfold, transporting readers to new heights of wonder or, conversely, inducing a sense of listlessness. Even the most seasoned authors, like Dr. Merlin, have succumbed to the pitfalls of excessive exposition, only to be met with a cacophony of frustration at their digital doorstep.\n\nExposition, as we all know, is the nemesis of engaging storytelling. While it's essential to provide context, there's a fine line between informative passages and narrative overload. Dr. Merlin cautions against allowing exposition to dictate the tempo of your narrative, lest it stifles the very essence of your tale.\n\nThe adage \"Show, don't tell\" is a fundamental principle of good writing, and yet, many authors still falter in this regard. Exposition often masquerades as a harmless indulgence, but in reality, it's a subtle saboteur that can derail even the most promising narratives.\n\nIn film and literature, exposition can manifest as a character's lengthy monologue or, in the case of fiction, the author's own telling of events. A pertinent example is the tale of a heroine whose life is recounted in rapid succession – her meeting, her marriage, her husband's untimely demise. Rather than diving headfirst into the aftermath, the author often devotes an inordinate amount of space to summarizing these events. A more effective approach would be to weave these details into the fabric of the narrative, allowing the reader to develop an emotional connection with the characters and their experiences.\n\nTake the introduction of a new character, for instance. Rather than dumping a plethora of biographical information – military background, current occupation, past marriages, and personal aspirations – consider peppering these details throughout the narrative, allowing them to emerge organically. This approach will create a more nuanced and engaging character, and, ultimately, a more immersive reading experience.\n\nIn short, it's essential to provide substance to the bare bones of your story. Resist the temptation to rush through pivotal moments, and instead, take the time to breathe life into the narrative. By doing so, you'll craft a tale that lingers in the reader's mind, long after the final page has been turned.",
            "I tuned in to two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio on the morning of August 13, 2011. The first, an NBC 4 broadcast, featured a live report. The lead story centered on a domestic assault case in Ashley, Ohio, where a local man named Shad Hostettler had allegedly assaulted his wife. The station's coverage provided a brief overview, stating that multiple stab wounds were involved and that Hostettler had been apprehended. The brevity of the report seemed reasonable, given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, in which an 18-year-old victim, Travis Buyers, had been critically injured. The authorities had yet to identify any suspects or make arrests at the time of the broadcast. The SWAT team was investigating the incident. This story seemed relatively short, and one possible reason for this might be the neighborhood in which the shooting occurred. Observing a pattern over the years, I have noticed that certain communities and individuals often receive lesser media attention when they are victims of crime.\n\nThe next segment reported on a shooting incident involving a Med-Flight helicopter, which had sustained damage from a .22 caliber rifle round. The authorities were seeking information from the public to aid in the identification of the perpetrator, offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to an arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend predicted scattered thunderstorms on Saturday, with temperatures ranging from the mid-to-low eighties. The brevity of this segment may have been intentional, as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie, was said to be approximately 6 feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The emphasis on the perpetrator's skin tone and physical appearance struck me as unusual.\n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a report on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating the sentence, the newscaster referred to the 300-month prison term. I am unsure of the reasoning behind this choice of words. Additionally, the report mentioned Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, which, in my opinion, was not particularly relevant to the story.",
            "In the complex tapestry of human relationships, one bond stands out for its peculiar depth and intensity: the bond between brothers. This connection, born of shared experiences and mutual understanding, is a multifaceted entity that encompasses a wide range of emotions, from the purest love to the darkest cruelty. It is in the most trying of circumstances that the true nature of this bond is revealed, often with far-reaching consequences. The intricate dance of emotions that defines the brotherly bond can be a double-edged sword, leading to profound self-discovery and a deeper understanding of one's own character.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, delving into the labyrinthine emotions that accompany it. Against the backdrop of a lush, vividly described landscape, two brothers embark on a perilous journey that is ultimately doomed to fail. The tension between bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a boiling point in a climactic confrontation, resulting in a tragedy that leaves one brother alive. Through the protagonist's character development and interactions with his brother, as well as the narrative's introspective tone, the novel effectively conveys the complex interplay of emotions that shape the protagonist's actions.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's motivations is a singular emotion: pride. From their earliest encounters, the protagonist harbors a deep-seated resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. The protagonist's idealized vision of brotherhood, which includes sharing exciting experiences like exploring the wilderness and engaging in physical activities, is cruelly shattered by Doodle's fragile health. The protagonist's frustration and anger are palpable, even extending to the point of considering a heinous act. However, a simple gesture from Doodle – a smile – momentarily assuages the protagonist's darker impulses, revealing a glimmer of love and compassion that lies beneath his resentment. This dichotomy highlights the complexity of the protagonist's emotions, underscoring the idea that even in the depths of despair, there is always a spark of goodness that can be fanned into flame.",
            "As the cerebral cortex has evolved, so too have the analogies employed to elucidate its intricate functions. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then augmented by the metaphor of a papyrus scroll, followed by the more mechanistic notion of a book, and most recently, a computer has been invoked. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that the utility of these analogies is inherently limited and may lead to unintended inferences.\n\nPerception begins with the transformation of sensory stimuli into electrochemical signals by the sensory organs. These signals undergo iterative processing through the brain's algorithms, combining both hierarchical and feedback-driven mechanisms. For instance, when observing a black box on a white background, the hierarchical processing integrates basic features such as color, orientation, and spatial boundaries to identify the object as a box. Meanwhile, the feedback-driven mechanism utilizes pre-existing knowledge to refine the recognition and distinguish it from a box-shaped void in the background.\n\nInformation processing reaches a critical juncture when an attentional filter determines the signal's salience and allocates cognitive resources accordingly. As an illustration, although the brain processes every individual blade of grass when one gazes at their shoes, a healthy attentional filter prevents individual blades from being consciously noted, whereas the name \"John\" might be picked out amidst background noise. This dynamic interplay between processing stages is recurrently modulated by attention.\n\nFor information to be processed, it must first be stored. The brain employs multiple forms of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information undergoes encoding, which varies depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal information can be encoded based on its structural characteristics, phonetic properties, or semantic meaning. Subsequently, information must be maintained. Research on animal subjects suggests that working memory, which has a duration of approximately 20 seconds, relies on a transient electrical signal traversing a specific series of neurons. The storage of long-term memories is hypothesized to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nDifferent theories have been proposed to explain the cerebral organization of knowledge, drawing from human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, interconnected according to their semantic relationships. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the emerging threat of technological advancements and the capitalist systems that perpetuate them. In Huxley's vision of the future, societal values prioritize communal harmony over individual autonomy, with citizens conditioned from birth to pursue immediate gratification above all else. This collective acceptance of a predetermined fate is orchestrated by the enigmatic World Controller, who wields control over the masses through a rigid ideology.\n\nWhen examined through the lens of Marxist thought, Huxley's work reveals a profound skepticism towards the capitalist systems of his time. The author employs Marxist terminology, such as 'homogeny' and 'reification,' to illustrate the insidious effects of unchecked economic development. Huxley's use of these terms underscores his concern that the capitalist system perpetuates a false sense of reality, where individuals are disconnected from their true social and economic relationships.\n\nThe concept of false consciousness, a central tenet of Marxist theory, is exemplified in Huxley's portrayal of the working-class citizens in Brave New World. These individuals are manipulated into prioritizing their own self-interest over any notion of collective solidarity or social awareness. The conditioning of the population through hypnopædia reinforces this notion, as citizens are conditioned to crave consumption, indulgence, and conformity above all else. This is a deliberate tactic of control, orchestrated by the World Controller, to maintain the status quo and preserve the hegemony of the ruling elite.\n\nHuxley's depiction of social hierarchy in Brave New World is a masterful commentary on the oppressive nature of capitalism. The lower classes, exemplified by the Delta and Gamma castes, are oblivious to the machinations of the ruling class, while the upper classes, represented by the Alphas and Betas, are either complicit in their own oppression or apathetic towards the plight of others. The relationships between characters in the novel are superficial and lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has stifled human connections and emotional expression.\n\nFurthermore, Huxley's work highlights the ways in which capitalist systems breed complacency and obedience among the working class. The societal classes are content with their roles in the hierarchy, further reinforcing the Marxist notion that the proletariat are conditioned to believe in their own superiority, as long as they conform to the expectations of their peers and consume according to the dictates of the ruling class.",
            "As a member of the University Park community for the past two and a half years, I have become increasingly aware of the challenges associated with navigating our campus. The sprawling nature of the school, combined with its rapid expansion, has made getting from one destination to another a time-consuming and often arduous task. My personal experience of traveling from my off-campus residence in Stuart Hall to various classes, such as those in the Willard building, has sometimes taken up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when weather conditions are unfavorable. I recall speaking to an alumnus who shared with me the history of the East Halls dormitory complex, which was once isolated from the rest of campus by a large tract of undeveloped land. However, this open space has since given way to new sports facilities, buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and surrounding residential units. As the campus continues to grow and evolve, it is crucial to address the issue of mobility.\n\nI recently engaged in a conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his renewed enthusiasm for this mode of transportation by remarking, \"Bikes are my go-to; for a while, it wasn't the most popular option, but it's the most efficient way to get around.\" Not only does cycling offer physical benefits, but it also allows individuals to cover significant distances without expending excessive time or energy. In fact, a nutritious meal and some moderate exercise can easily cover 30 miles or more. As someone who now resides off-campus, I can attest to the value of owning a bike. What has been my most practical decision this year has been purchasing a bicycle, allowing me to travel from my residence to Thomas building, which is approximately a 25-minute walk, in just 5 minutes when I pedal at a brisk pace. Nevertheless, I have encountered challenges while navigating Pollock Road, which offers the most direct route to Thomas building from my home. While walking has its benefits, I find that I am too busy to devote the necessary time to this mode of transportation. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for attending classes and other activities, resulting in an additional 30-40 minutes of travel time each day. Over the course of a week, this would translate to over 2.5 hours, which I simply cannot afford to spare."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "As I embark on a journey to pursue a degree in social work, I envision a career path that aligns with the mission of the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a meaningful impact in the lives of children who have been subjected to abuse or neglect. My professional values include dedication to service, respect for individuals, a strong commitment to ethics, and a relentless pursuit of personal and professional growth to ensure excellence in my field. These core values not only reflect the principles of social work but also resonate deeply with my personal philosophy.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have always been driven by a desire to make a positive difference in the lives of others. However, I was initially uncertain about the career path that would allow me to achieve this goal. My experiences in high school and college exposed me to individuals who struggled with various challenges, and I witnessed firsthand the importance of effective coping mechanisms. After graduating from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a deliberate break to reflect on my career aspirations. It was during this time that I had an epiphany. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was dealing with a difficult home situation. His story had a profound impact on me, and I felt compelled to take action. I reached out to the authorities and offered my support, leveraging my degree in Psychology to help address the situation. The experience marked a turning point for me, and I began to seriously consider a career in social work, which would enable me to make a tangible difference in the lives of children and families.\n\nIn addition to service, social justice is another value that drives me to pursue a career in social work. As a society, we often emphasize the importance of individuality, yet we often conform to societal norms. I believe that this dichotomy is a reflection of our desire to be part of a larger collective, rather than embracing our unique characteristics. Throughout my academic and personal journey, I have consistently sought to challenge social norms and promote inclusivity. I have expressed my individuality through self-expression, participating in various extracurricular activities and causes that align with my values, such as advocating for social justice and equality.",
            "This paper delves into the dual perspectives of biological and sociocultural factors contributing to the complex issue of insomnia. The biological model delves into the genetic underpinnings of sleep disorders, encompassing heritable traits and physiological aspects that impact sleep patterns. Conversely, the sociocultural model explores environmental relationships and their influence on sleep, taking into account demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and demographics.\n\nInsomnia can manifest as a primary sleep disorder, a comorbid condition with a mental health disorder, or a disorder precipitated by medical complications or substance use. The primary sleep disorders comprise Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, with Dyssonmias encompassing Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other related conditions. Primary Insomnia involves difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy, marked by cataplexy and automatic REM sleep, is a distinct entity within this category. In contrast, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral or physiological abnormalities, including Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders is centered on the role of genetics, inherited factors, and the physiological mechanisms governing sleep-wake cycles. Research has identified key neurons in the hypothalamus, containing orexin, which regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on these orexin neurons are crucial for modulating sleep-wake states. The activation of GABAA receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can induce reduced anxiety and facilitate sleep. Furthermore, a GABAB agonist (baclofen) was found to increase sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor could compromise an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are significant, as the heritability of the phenotype could influence sleep patterns, and alterations to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, impacting daily life, including academic and professional responsibilities.",
            "Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) is a complex condition that affects the brain's ability to process auditory information. This disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is characterized by the inefficient transmission of auditory signals to the brain, resulting in difficulties with sound perception and processing. In essence, individuals with CAPD can hear sounds, but their brain struggles to interpret and make sense of the auditory information. This distinction is crucial, as it differentiates CAPD from hearing impairments, which involve the physical inability to perceive sounds.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the early 1950s, when researchers first identified the disorder as \"auditory imperception.\" Subsequent studies by Italian researchers, led by Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, laid the groundwork for the development of tests to assess auditory processing in children with communicative disorders. The introduction of dichotic testing by Kimura in 1961 further advanced our understanding of the physiological basis of auditory processing. A national conference convened in 1977 sparked a surge in research focused on CAPD, paving the way for the development of diagnostic tools and treatments.\n\nCAPD manifests in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, acoustic event discrimination, sound pattern recognition, speech differentiation, and sound synthesis. Individuals with CAPD may also struggle to sequence auditory information, leading to challenges with auditory processing. Other common symptoms include sound blocking, where a subsequent sound obscures the preceding one, and the inability to differentiate changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm through changes in tone.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's auditory function, which may include systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory tests administered by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals. While no single test or tool is universally accepted as a diagnostic gold standard, a range of measures are used to assess auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors. Advanced tests may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "The use of disguise as a means of deception in Twelfth Night raises intriguing questions about the consequences of adopting a new persona. On one hand, the adoption of a disguise can facilitate deception and allow individuals to navigate complex social situations, but it also risks leading to a loss of one's true identity. The difficulty of ending a deception is further complicated by the possibility of alienation, as others may respond with offense or disinterest upon discovering the truth.\n\nThe theme of deception in the context of gender role reversal is particularly fraught, as it highlights the underlying motivations behind adopting a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to assume the identity of a man is driven by a desire for self-preservation, as she seeks to protect herself from potential threats in a foreign land. However, this decision comes at a cost, as it isolates her from her support network and creates complications in her relationships with others.\n\nThe dynamics between Viola, Olivia, and Orsino are complex and multifaceted. Olivia's confusion of Viola with Sebastian and her subsequent romantic feelings for Cesario raise questions about the nature of attraction and desire. One interpretation is that the appearance of Cesario forces Olivia to confront her own suppressed emotions, but this reading is complicated by the fact that Olivia's affections seem to shift easily, suggesting that her feelings may be driven by superficial characteristics rather than deeper emotional connections.\n\nThis nuance is underscored by Olivia's later characterization of Viola as a sister, which suggests that her earlier romantic feelings for Cesario were perhaps superficial or misguided. The play thus raises questions about the complexities of human relationships and the ways in which we navigate our emotions and desires.\n\nUltimately, Twelfth Night presents a rich and thought-provoking exploration of the human experience, one that challenges readers to consider the consequences of deception, the complexity of identity, and the nature of human relationships.",
            "The German colonial administration has been characterized by its starkly differing approaches to governance, with certain colonies exhibiting notably harsh treatment of indigenous populations. The Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa are a striking example of this, with widespread accounts of genocide and brutality. However, it would be inaccurate to generalize the entire colonial empire's policies based on a single instance. The German colonial administration's policies and approaches varied significantly across the colonies, mirroring the region's diverse geography.\n\nEducation provision, in particular, demonstrated considerable variation across the colonies. When the British took control of German East Africa (now known as Tanzania) in 1919, they found an educated and literate indigenous population, with some praising the German efforts in this regard. Conversely, German colonial policies in Kamerun and other territories received similarly positive commentary from contemporaries.\n\nSouth West Africa, now Namibia, presented a stark contrast to East Africa. In the latter, the government played a pivotal role in establishing state schools and providing education to the local population. In contrast, the responsibility for educating native populations in South West Africa was largely left to missionary societies, which received limited support from the government. The administration, however, invested substantial resources in educating the European population, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support to missionary institutions. The educational policies implemented in South West Africa had lasting effects on the colony, persisting even after German rule. Conversely, other German colonies witnessed significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various factors, including social, political, and economic elements, contributed to the divergent experiences of South West Africa.\n\nThis investigation aims to build upon existing research by examining the underlying factors that led to this divergence, with particular emphasis on recent studies examining the views of settlers and colonial authorities on indigenous populations. \n\nA substantial body of literature explores education in the German colonial empire, with a significant portion of this literature written in German and produced during or shortly after the colonial era. Early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in individual colonies. Later studies written in English expanded the discussion through comparative analyses of education across various colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of education. Notably, Cohen's study of education in South West Africa and East Africa offers a comprehensive comparison of the two colonies' educational systems and identifies key factors contributing to their differences. According to Cohen, the presence of a substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the colony's distinct characteristics.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, despite the prevalence of arid desert terrain. This environment attracted a larger European population, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in South West Africa by 1913, compared to approximately 5,336 in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa.",
            "The evolution of popular music has led to a proliferation of genres over the past century, making it a daunting task to compile an exhaustive list. Furthermore, numerous sub-genres have branched out from the primary categories of rock, jazz, folk, and country, rendering the musical landscape increasingly complex. Among these, the heavy metal sub-genre has emerged as a particularly dynamic and expressive force, with a propensity for conveying a wide range of emotions, predominantly leaning towards the darker end of the emotional spectrum.\n\nThe diversity of heavy metal is evident in its adaptability, as artists began to experiment and push the boundaries of the genre from its inception. This fluidity has given rise to a multitude of sub-genres, each with its unique characteristics, resulting in a rich tapestry of sounds. The proliferation of niches within the heavy metal movement has reached a point where defining the genre has become a challenging endeavor.\n\nTo grasp the essence of contemporary metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the underlying principles that drive its evolution. Heavy metal can be seen as a movement characterized by its affinity for the darker aspects of human experience. Musically, this is manifested through an emphasis on volume, intensity, and technical proficiency, often accompanied by theatricality and a sense of chaos. Lyrically, heavy metal often explores themes of darkness, introspection, and the human condition, often drawing from literary and philosophical influences.\n\nThe roots of heavy metal can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s, when psychedelic rock and the counterculture movement fostered a climate of experimentation and innovation. The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, exemplifies this spirit of pushing boundaries and exploring the darker aspects of human experience. Written in response to the Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" \"Helter Skelter\" demonstrated the Beatles' willingness to confront the heavier and more aggressive side of rock music, paving the way for the development of the heavy metal genre.",
            "In the years preceding the Surrealist art movement, an innovative artist was quietly weaving his own brand of reality, both literally and figuratively. Henri Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only showcases a woman captivated by the wonders of a fantastical realm but also serves as a poignant reflection of the artist's own aspirations and inner turmoil. Having longed for recognition, acceptance, and admiration from his peers, Rousseau grappled with a profound internal conflict – to conform to the conventions of his time or to forge his own unique path, unencumbered by the expectations of the art world he admired.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream within this context, one must first delve into the life and experiences that shaped Rousseau's artistic vision. Born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval, northwest France, Rousseau came from a family that enjoyed a comfortable upper-class existence. His father operated a successful business, which provided him with a relatively stable upbringing. Despite the absence of formal artistic training, Rousseau spent over two decades employed in a mundane job with the municipal toll service, earning him the colloquial nickname \"douanier\" – a customs inspector – although his official title was gabelou. The untimely death of his first wife and eight infant children left Rousseau heartbroken, with only his daughter Julia remaining. This loss marked a turning point in his life, prompting him to seek solace in painting as a means of escape and renewal. Unlike his contemporaries, who often idolized and romanticized the peasantry, Rousseau drew inspiration from the experiences and aspirations of the common man.\n\nGiven his unorthodox background and the fact that he began his artistic journey at an advanced age, Rousseau's desire for recognition in the art world is understandable. He produced his works alongside some of the most renowned artists of his time, including Henri Matisse, who was just beginning to establish himself as a prominent figure in the art world. According to Jan Gordon's account in Modern French Painters, the two artists, while technically rivals, differed in their motivations and artistic visions. While Matisse sought to avoid the mundane and trite, Rousseau aimed to create works that were so conventional that they would be acknowledged by the French art establishment.",
            "Philosophers have long debated the connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting that truth and beauty are deeply intertwined. I propose that there is a fundamental reason for this association. The poet John Keats' famous phrase in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" encapsulates this idea: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty—That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Much of our understanding of the world comes from education and experience, but our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional means of acquisition. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate, the nature of right and wrong, or what makes a work beautiful.\n\nMore specifically, critiques of art and morality often struggle to capture the essence of what makes something good or beautiful. In discussions of art, such as those surrounding Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may focus on technical aspects like composition, context, or cultural significance, but these elements only scratch the surface. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often express that there's something intangible that sets it apart. I believe that art and morals share this elusive quality, which cannot be fully reduced to a description of their characteristics. As writer Flannery O'Connor noted, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics and aesthetics possess a transcendent dimension that cannot be captured by analysis.\n\nWittgenstein's assertion that \"ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental\" underscores the inexpressible nature of ethics. I propose that this transcendent aspect is the most powerful attribute of both art and morality, and serves as a common thread connecting them. \n\nI also believe that the relationship between ethics and aesthetics is rooted in their shared capacity to evoke a profound, yet inexplicable, sense of connection. This phenomenon is most pronounced in literature, as McKean suggests: \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern identity is characterized by its robust cultural landscape, a harmonious blend of influences stretching from the picturesque Alpine region around Munich to the Baltic coast of Kiel. This rich cultural tapestry is also evident in Köln, situated on the Rhine River, and extends through the heart of the country to Dresden, a city nestled on the banks of the Elbe. Given its unique cultural heritage, it is hardly surprising that Germany's modern identity has evolved from a complex interplay of various historical sources and tribes.\n\nThe origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in debate among scholars and historians. Some attribute the name to the Tungrian tribe, which, according to Tacitus, was known as the Germans prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in battles with Gaulish forces (Tacitus, circa 98 CE). Alternatively, Julius Caesar's writings on the Gallic Wars (50-40 BC) suggest that he derived the term from the Gauls themselves, using it to distinguish between those they had conquered and those they had not. In his commentary, Caesar notes: \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, circa 50-40 BC). Others propose that the term \"German\" may be linked to the Gaulish word for \"neighbor\" or the Old English word \"ger,\" referring to a spear used in warfare. The term could also be derived from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which might imply that the Germans were known for their loud or boisterous nature (Oxford English Dictionary, 2010).\n\nTacitus' work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (circa 98 CE) offers valuable insights into the origins of the Germanic tribes. In it, he writes: \"I would regard (the Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed with other races through immigration or intercourse... Who would leave Asia or Africa for Italy, for Germany with its harsh climate, rugged terrain, and stern demeanor, unless it were their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, circa 98 CE). This perception of Germania as a land shunned by outsiders is reinforced by the Roman Empire's historical reluctance to colonize the region. While the Romans did venture into Germanic territories, they often returned to their empire, and the Germanic tribes maintained their independence, interacting with the Romans primarily through trade and military service (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "As I stood there, my gaze fell upon the scene before me, my mind processing the details without engaging in any emotional response. My thoughts fluttered in and out of my consciousness like leaves on a breeze, each one vanishing as quickly as it appeared. My mental state was a fluid, effortless experience, unencumbered by personal interpretations or biases.\n\nI had long been fascinated by the creative process, and as a child, I often dreamed of becoming an artist. Years ago, I had stumbled upon a book called \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" which offered a unique approach to understanding the artistic process. The book outlined various techniques, including the use of a mental frame to simplify complex subjects. By placing a square boundary around a scene, the artist could focus on the essence of the image, stripping away extraneous details.\n\nAs I stood there, staring at the unassuming pile of waste before me, I couldn't help but think of this technique. The artist's frame seemed to elude me, however, and I found myself overwhelmed by the sheer mundane nature of the scene. The flush of memories from my art class came flooding back – Picasso's blue period, Monet's love of greenery, and the vibrant colors of the Italian Renaissance masters. I had always aspired to create something beautiful, something worthy of being called art. In that moment, I felt a spark of inspiration, a sense that I was on the cusp of something creative.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the toilet handle, my muscles tensing and relaxing as I prepared to begin. The water swirled and churned, a soothing melody that seemed to match the rhythm of my heart. I felt a sense of calm wash over me as I gazed down at the offending mass before me. My hand tightened its grip on the handle, and with a gentle motion, I began to work. The water continued to flow, a soothing serenade that accompanied my creative process.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, my thoughts turned to the task at hand. I stood tall, my feet shoulder-width apart, my grip on the toilet handle steady. My eyes never left the target, my focus unwavering. The water continued to flow, a relentless, calming force that seemed to carry away my doubts and fears. And then, with a quiet determination, I reached for the toilet paper roll, my hand wrapping around it like a grasp of a lifeline. The next few moments were a blur of movement and sound, a symphony of action and purpose.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage driving fatalities is a pressing concern that warrants attention and reform.  A multitude of factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  Research indicates that the adolescent brain is still maturing and lacks the necessary sophistication to navigate the complexities of driving.  Furthermore, inexperience plays a significant role in the high number of fatalities and accidents involving teenagers.  This inexperience is not only linked to a higher incidence of fatal crashes but also an increased likelihood of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.\n\nIt is also worth noting that teenagers tend to fare poorly when driving with their peers, a demographic often found in most driving situations.  A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center highlighted a significant correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents.\n\nIn response to this issue, several states have implemented measures to enhance teen driver safety, including provisional licenses with restrictions on driving hours and passenger limits.  However, these measures are merely temporary solutions and do not address the root cause of the problem.  As a group, young drivers are statistically less equipped to handle the risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nPsychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that the desire for thrill-seeking behavior is particularly prevalent among individuals under the age of 20.  This, coupled with the fact that many of these young drivers are still developing physically and cognitively, makes a strong case for delaying full licensure until the individual has matured further.  If we continue to issue unrestricted driver's licenses to teenagers, the number of fatalities is likely to continue to rise, with devastating consequences.\n\nA more effective approach would be to establish a uniform national standard that prohibits anyone under the age of 18 from operating a motor vehicle.  Schools could continue to provide driver education classes, and a provisional permit could be issued prior to granting a full driver's license, with a requirement for a certain number of supervised driving hours.  This could be modeled after existing state guidelines, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  By implementing a nationwide policy, we can better protect teen drivers across the country.\n\nThis proposal is not a novel idea, but rather a response to a pressing issue that requires a unified approach.  By taking a proactive stance, we can reduce the number of teen driving fatalities and create a safer road environment for all.",
            "During an expedition through the extensive film archives at the Library of Congress, I came across a collection of early Edison films, specifically those categorized as trick films, which spanned from 1895 to 1901. A total of fifteen films fell under this category, each showcasing the innovative use of editing techniques to create illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic qualities of the majority of these trick films, as well as identifying distinct deviations from typical conventions in a few later productions. The prevailing style of trick films at the turn of the century was characterized by its confinement to a set-bound, frontal proscenium, static camera, and reliance on long and medium shots, adhering to a strict one-shot-per-film approach. However, there were a few exceptions among early 20th-century trick films that dared to challenge these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most striking commonalities among trick films is their predilection for filming within a confined interior set, adhering to the traditional frontal proscenium structure. The camera remained stationary, never deviating from its fixed position to follow characters or objects. This composition drew inspiration from the theatre and, in the case of trick films, vaudeville and magic performances. A notable limitation inherent in this approach was the restriction of character movement to side-to-side motions, with minimal or no forward or backward movement towards the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors entered from the right side and moved horizontally, with the camera remaining steadfast in its position.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also dictated that shots predominantly consisted of long shots, with occasional medium shots. Close-ups were virtually nonexistent in the Edison catalog's trick films, a trait borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville traditions, where the audience would view the entire performance within the framed stage. In most early films, characters rarely moved towards the camera, thereby precluding the use of close-ups. The prevailing convention that one conceptual shot equated to one film led to a typical runtime of about a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. This constraint limited the narrative and dramatic potential of trick films, which mostly focused on concise, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and switching performances with minimal storytelling. However, it's worth noting that a single \"shot\" in a trick film can actually comprise multiple joined shots, cleverly designed to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. A prime example of this can be seen in The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, where a closer examination reveals the exact moment when the physical shot of Mary's severed \"head\" commences, despite the film's conceptual unity as one shot in the viewer's perception.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline, a pioneering figure in the early American republic, was a steadfast advocate for limited government and the preservation of individual liberties. As a farmer and a politician, he was deeply committed to the values of agrarianism, which informed his views on governance and the role of the state. His unwavering dedication to the principles of self-sufficiency and rural life influenced his stance on issues of sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary.\n\nTaylor believed that the United States had a unique opportunity to establish a system of government that would prioritize the rights and freedoms of its citizens. He was a strong proponent of the idea that natural rights are inherent and inalienable, and that their deprivation would have far-reaching consequences for the entire social fabric. In his view, the \"state of nature\" – a concept he often invoked to describe the primordial human condition – was characterized by the dominance of the strong over the weak, but he saw this as a scenario that should be mitigated in a civilized society.\n\nTo create a more just and equitable society, Taylor argued that a government must be designed to balance the inherent duality of human nature, acknowledging both its capacity for good and its propensity for evil. He was a firm believer in the idea that government, being a human institution, is susceptible to the same vices and virtues as its citizens. According to Taylor, a government founded on good principles would prioritize the protection of private property, the advancement of agriculture, and the regulation of capitalism, thereby ensuring a more equitable distribution of wealth and power.\n\nTaylor's understanding of human nature led him to conclude that self-interest was a fundamental driving force behind human behavior, but he distinguished between self-interest that serves the common good and that which exploits others. A good government, in his opinion, should strive to harness self-interest in the service of the greater good, while also monitoring its own influence to prevent the introduction of corrupting principles.\n\nIn line with his commitment to limited government, Taylor advocated for a strict construction of the Constitution, which he believed should be interpreted in a literal and uncompromising manner. He was wary of expansive federal power, which he saw as a threat to individual liberties and a recipe for despotism. However, he also recognized the importance of considering the intent behind the Constitution's framers, lest a simplistic interpretation lead to abuse and corruption. Moreover, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the foundational document of the United States, as it more explicitly enshrined the principles of sovereignty and the rights of the people.",
            "Upon examining the data in Figure 17, a notable decrease in commuter log submissions becomes apparent during the third month of the project. This decline, while disappointing, is somewhat understandable, particularly when considering the seasonal factors that may have influenced participation. As winter sets in at our New England campus, there is a natural decrease in bicycle and pedestrian traffic, which could account for a portion of the drop. Additionally, the end of the fall semester and the ensuing busy holiday season may have led to a decrease in overall campus activity, resulting in commuter logs slipping down the priority list for many individuals. Furthermore, the month-long break during the holidays may have reduced the need for students and faculty to physically attend campus, thus reducing the incentive to log their commutes.\n\nIt is also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project led to an initial surge in participation, which naturally tapered off over time. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week, a targeted campaign in March designed to reinvigorate the initiative and boost log submissions, which ultimately succeeded in achieving this goal.\n\nOne of the key challenges we faced in maintaining project momentum was the inherent difficulty of combating the natural decrease in engagement that occurs during periods of seasonal and academic transition. Furthermore, the cultural preference for driving personal vehicles poses a significant obstacle to alternative commuting initiatives. To mitigate this, we introduced incentives in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, which seemed to be effective in encouraging participation. However, it is intriguing to consider whether larger, more substantial prizes, such as a bicycle, hybrid car, or electric vehicle, may have had an even greater impact on participation. By increasing the value of prizes over time, we may have been able to sustain engagement levels and avoid the decline experienced during the project. The consistency of our incentive structure, while effective initially, may not have been enough to counteract the decline in participation, particularly during the holiday season.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) offers investors a unique hybrid model, combining the diversification benefits of an index fund with the flexibility of a single stock. Like its index fund counterpart, an ETF allows investors to tap into a broad market segment, but its exchange-listed status enables buyers to purchase and sell shares like individual stocks. This flexibility comes with several attractive benefits, including the ability to sell short, buy on margin, and acquire as few as one share in a transaction. A key advantage of ETFs over mutual funds lies in their significantly lower expense ratios. However, this convenience comes at a cost, as investors incur trading commissions on ETF transactions, just like those associated with individual stock trades.\n\nETFs boast an extensive array of investment options, catering to diverse investor preferences. Nevertheless, astute investors must critically evaluate the touted benefits, such as diversification, to determine their actual value and extent. In this analysis, we will examine the ETF IHF and its top 10 holdings, comprising 63.58% of its total assets, to assess whether a single ETF can provide comparable benefits to a diversified portfolio of the constituent stocks, and whether an alternative configuration might yield a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we have selected the top 10 holdings, which collectively represent the majority of the ETF's assets. By using the current asset allocation as a basis, we can estimate the contributions of each stock to a hypothetical portfolio's risk and return, should it consist entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The accompanying chart provides the calculated Beta and return values for the top 10 holdings.\n\nA cursory examination of the chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings would yield a 6.11% higher return than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Notably, the Beta of this hypothetical portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. Preliminary results suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer higher returns with reduced volatility. However, it is essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo investigate this further, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalized it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF's accumulated standard deviation. This analysis will help determine whether the performance differences between the ETF and its top 10 holdings are statistically distinguishable.",
            "The poem \"Dream-Land\" is notable for its unique incorporation of the term \"Thulé,\" a concept that has its roots in the works of Virgil. However, an often-overlooked precursor to Virgil's use of the term can be found in the writings of Karl J. Arndt, who explores the shared literary influences between Edgar Allan Poe and Goethe in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon.\" Arndt's analysis highlights a possible case of literary borrowing, where Poe draws inspiration from Goethe's works.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature notes that Goethe was a prominent literary figure, renowned for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832. Within \"Faust,\" a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" presents a narrative of a king whose wife's passing sets him on a path of tragic introspection. This poem, which explores themes of grief and mortality, bears a striking resemblance to Poe's depiction of a desolate Thulé in \"Dream-Land.\"\n\nIn \"The King of Thulé,\" the monarch's descent into despair is precipitated by the loss of his wife, a theme that echoes in Poe's own work. The narrative of the king's downfall, marked by his excessive drinking and eventual demise, serves as a poignant commentary on the human experience. Interestingly, the similarities between \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" suggest a possible connection between the two poems, with the latter serving as a dark mirror to the former.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in multiple works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" underscores his familiarity with Goethe's writing. The fact that Poe references \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" as bookends adds weight to the idea that these poems are interconnected. A closer reading of \"Dream-Land\" reveals a landscape of desolation and loss, which is strikingly reminiscent of the king's experience in \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Tennyson, it is likely that he was well-versed in Goethe's work. While this connection is not direct, it is clear that Poe was influenced by Goethe's writing, as evident in the numerous reproductions of Goethe's work that were circulating during Poe's time. The interplay between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's \"The King of Thulé\" serves as a testament to the power of literary borrowing and the enduring influence of great works on subsequent writers.",
            "Under the jurisdiction of California law, a customer who suffered an injury after slipping and falling on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store may potentially be awarded punitive damages if they can demonstrate that the store manager's actions displayed a reckless disregard for the potential risks associated with the situation.\n\nA judge is unlikely to dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages without further consideration. In order to establish a valid claim for punitive damages, the plaintiff must provide evidence that the defendant's actions were committed with a deliberate and wanton disregard for the potential harm that could arise from their conduct. Furthermore, they must also show that the defendant's behavior was egregious or despicable.\n\nPalmer may argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given the history of multiple slip-and-fall incidents at D&D Markets in the months leading up to Palmer's accident. Despite this knowledge, Martin chose not to address the issue. Additionally, Palmer may point to the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009, and Martin did not take adequate steps to maintain the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, informed his manager, Paul Martin, about a spill in an aisle. Martin responded that he was on a break and could not attend to customer complaints. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also notified Martin about the spill, but he gave the same response. Thirty minutes after the initial report, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D Markets in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining the possibility of filing a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation that does not arise from a contractual agreement if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it involves a deliberate disregard of the plaintiff's rights, especially when the defendant is aware of the potential risks associated with their actions and deliberately chooses to ignore them, leading to harm.",
            "Approximately four years ago, I had the opportunity to explore the complexities of Islam through a course at CBC.  One of the most contentious topics we discussed in the class was the notion of Islam as a potentially hostile faith.  In light of the events that have transpired since 9/11, I believe this question is more pertinent than ever.  Observing the shift in the media's portrayal of Islam and extremism has been striking.  In 2001, a presidential candidate with a name like Barack Obama, who has a Muslim heritage, would have been unimaginable.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a subject that continues to fascinate me.  My understanding of his history, as gleaned from various accounts, reveals a paradoxical figure.  I once believed that Muhammad compelled conversions to Islam through conquest and coercion, but the biography presents a more nuanced portrayal – that of a misunderstood and humbled individual who inspired people to seek him out.  This dichotomy has left me with a multitude of questions about the Prophet's true nature.\n\nNotably, there are intriguing parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the reported miracles of Muhammad.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying food to feed a group of forty men.  This style of storytelling has led me to wonder if the writers intended to convey Muhammad as a humble, self-effacing figure who required no proof, but rather lived a life of truth and wonder.  This narrative approach has a profound impact on my perception of the story, as it subtly downplays the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThe biography also contains numerous anecdotes that appear to serve as testimonials to the validity of Islam.  However, I find it problematic that many of these accounts are secondhand, passed down through multiple individuals.  The intention behind these stories may be to provide evidence of the truth, but it ultimately undermines their credibility, making them seem suspicious and lacking in authenticity.\n\nWhat disturbs me most about this work is the attempt to portray Muhammad as a virtuous, compassionate, and wise individual.  Historical records, however, cast doubt on this characterization, and I am left wondering if Muslims today are aware of the true circumstances surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The teachings and convictions of Jesus, as well as the beliefs he advocated for during his lifetime, have been largely overlooked in the development of Christian thought that emerged after his passing.  From a broader historical perspective, it is evident that Christianity has gradually drifted further away from its origins over time.  As we navigate the complexities of today's world, an increased awareness and a trend towards progressive thinking are becoming increasingly apparent.  While those who adhere to traditional values and resist any deviation from established doctrine will undoubtedly continue to exist, their numbers may ultimately prove insufficient to significantly influence the broader trajectory of the faith.  In the years to come, a growing awareness of history among Christians will likely lead to a heightened desire to distinguish between the core principles of the faith and the additional ideas and dogma that have accumulated over time.  This process may take several generations or even centuries, but the eventual outcome is unavoidable: Christianity will undergo a significant reversal, gradually returning to its original form.  A movement will likely gain momentum, shedding the layers of doctrine that have accumulated over time, much like a clock rewinding itself, until only the fundamental principles imparted by Jesus remain.  As this trend takes hold in the United States and Europe, it will influence large numbers of people, leading to a return to a simpler, more authentic form of worship, one that closely resembles the faith as Jesus knew it.  The institution of the church will continue to play a significant role in guiding this process.  However, this reversal will also result in a decrease in the diversity of Christian thought and practice, as the theological clock unwinds, leading to a more uniform understanding of the faith.  Instead of differences between regions, denominations, and other divisions, we will witness an increasing convergence of beliefs and practices.  Human history is replete with examples of such reversals.  For instance, the Roman Empire, once hostile to Christianity, eventually became a bastion of the faith.  Similarly, the United States has undergone a significant shift from racism and oppression to greater inclusivity and equality.  In the future, Christianity will experience a similar reversion, one that will involve a return to the source of the faith and a reduction in diversity.  It is essential to note that one key factor that will facilitate this process is the reevaluation of Jesus' words as metaphorical and not literal statements of fact.  In order to understand the evolution of Christianity, we must look back to its earliest roots.  If we examine the historical record, we find that, prior to Jesus' lifetime, the Jewish faith was the primary theological influence behind Christianity.  By the time the Romans took control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the core tenets of Judaism, including monotheism, a divinely revealed faith, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were well-established.  However, the Jewish population was not united, with various groups such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people existing side by side.",
            "One of the primary concerns expressed in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle revolves around the innate self-interest of human beings. It is argued that deep down, individuals primarily focus on bettering their own lives and overlook the well-being of those less fortunate. This theme is demonstrated through various characters and settings in the novel. \n\nOn one hand, factory owners and managers exemplify this self-interest, striving to expand their businesses without regard for the consequences. The narrative highlights the damaging effects of their relentless pursuit of progress. Sinclair vividly describes the pollution caused by the factories, underscoring the owners' disregard for the environment and the people affected by it. The image of the smoke-filled atmosphere and the overwhelming pollution showcases the devastating impact of their actions.\n\nMoreover, the owners and managers care little for their employees, treating them as mere commodities to be exploited for profit. They prioritize profits over people, as seen in the following passage: \"A sense of envy and hostility pervades the entire community, devoid of any loyalty or decency.\" The employees are subjected to grueling working conditions and sudden layoffs, with little to no support or compensation. During the time period depicted in the novel, workers had limited protections, allowing the factory owners to operate with impunity.\n\nThe novel implies that the workers, worn down by their circumstances, were expected to endure the harsh conditions without any assistance. The lack of organizations or agencies providing aid to the working class left them vulnerable. While unions were formed, they often exploited the workers, prioritizing profits over their well-being. The workers were trapped in a cycle of poverty and dependence, likened to a system of slavery. As Sinclair writes, \"In this population, mostly foreign and low-income, people are perpetually on the brink of starvation, relying on the whims of men as ruthless as the old slave traders. Under these circumstances, immorality becomes as inevitable and widespread as it was under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "In literature, authors often employ various techniques to elicit a particular emotional response from their readers. Some methods are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby, exemplifies this notion, as he skillfully employs a range of techniques to convey meaning and create a specific atmosphere. One notable technique he uses is the juxtaposition of words to generate a particular connotation. For instance, Fitzgerald frequently combines adjectives with nouns in unexpected ways to create a distinct aura surrounding a subject. He also assigns abstract meanings to symbols and utilizes them to convey these interpretations. This technique is particularly evident in his use of colors, including gold, green, white, gray, and red/pink. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald develops and employs the meanings associated with these colors to create a particular emotional resonance.\n\nFitzgerald's use of color symbolism is a striking example of this technique. He establishes the connotations of white and gray early in the novel, often associating them with concepts such as uniformity, elegance, and age. The former is often linked to refinement and higher social status, while the latter is associated with a sense of wear and familiarity. This interpretation is established through repeated instances of these colors in relation to various characters and settings. For example, Daisy and Jordan are frequently dressed in white, as seen in \"they were dressed in white\" (8), while Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party. Tom, on the other hand, is often depicted wearing a \"white shirt\" (36), while Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). The sole exception to this trend is when Nick describes Gatsby's party, where the hall is \"gaudy with primary colors\" (40), emphasizing the stark contrast with the dominant use of white and gray.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces these associations by applying these colors to common, everyday subjects. When Nick commutes to work, he traverses the \"white chasms of lower New York\" (56), and the names on his timetable are written in \"gray\" (61). Catherine's apartment is likened to \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\" (28), exemplifying the uniformity Fitzgerald aims to convey. He also uses these colors to describe ordinary people and places, such as Jordan and Daisy's \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, and the \"gray old man\" (27) who sells dogs.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of white and gray, Fitzgerald employs these colors to signify a lack of significance or uniformity in the characters. This is particularly evident in his depiction of Daisy. Following a period of minimal use of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them in relation to Daisy, describing her as \"dressed in white\" in a \"little white roadster\" (74). This portrayal serves to undermine her character, reducing her to a uniform, desired object in Gatsby's eyes. This technique is further reinforced by the use of gray to describe Daisy's fur collar (18) and her appearance in a white dress (115) before the encounter between Tom and Gatsby.",
            "The San Diego County area boasts a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant climate. The region's diverse crop selection includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, peaches, lemons, berries, and peppers. There is a significant demand for locally sourced, organic produce, with many residents seeking out community-supported agriculture options. This trend has led to a waiting list for some local organizations offering these services. Organic dairy and egg production are also in high demand. Some farms in the area provide guided tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities, thereby enabling landowners to benefit from government programs while preserving natural habitats and generating additional revenue streams.\n\nNot only can organic farming fill a lucrative niche market, but it also contributes to increased biodiversity in the region. The absence of chemicals in the soil and water allows for a more diverse range of plant and animal species to thrive. However, organic farming often comes with higher operational costs. For instance, organic farming requires more labor and management to control pests and weeds without the use of synthetic chemicals, and losses can be greater than those experienced with conventional farming methods. Additionally, small-scale organic farms often lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.\n\nBeyond the specific practices associated with organic farming, land managers may also implement other beneficial techniques that support local wildlife, such as planting cover crops, rotational grazing, invasive species removal, and strategic management of vegetation to create specific habitats or open spaces. These efforts can be resource-intensive and may incur additional labor costs. As a result, a landowner in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance to optimize both profitability and environmental quality.\n\nThe chosen property is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, California, near the town of Potrero. The 160-acre parcel is comprised of a mix of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This area falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is currently being considered for inclusion in the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan encompasses over a hundred species, including several that are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher, as well as species that are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. The property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production during the intervening years.\n\nI selected a property from a real estate listing and researched relevant government programs to explore options for mitigating costs and promoting wildlife-friendly practices. As a model for a local farm, I identified an organic farm in the same area that serves as a potential example of what a landowner in this scenario might strive to achieve.",
            "Effective negotiation often relies on a nuanced understanding of the cultural context in which it takes place. This involves recognizing that culture is a multifaceted and dynamic entity, shaped by a complex interplay of factors. Rather than reducing cultures to simplistic stereotypes, such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"Japanese are accommodating,\" negotiators should strive to grasp the specific cultural nuances that influence decision-making and interactions.\n\nTo achieve this, it's essential to delve beyond broad generalizations and explore the deeper significance of a culture. This may involve studying its history, examining its values and biases, and acknowledging the unique experiences and perspectives that shape its members' interactions. By doing so, negotiators can develop a more empathetic and informed approach, better equipped to navigate the complexities of cross-cultural communication.\n\nWhen engaging with unfamiliar cultural contexts, it's natural to draw comparisons with one's own cultural background. However, this can also lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Instead, negotiators should aim to approach each culture with an open mind, suspending assumptions and judgments to appreciate its distinct character. This requires a willingness to adapt and be flexible, particularly when facing a weaker bargaining position or operating in unfamiliar territory.\n\nInterestingly, corporate culture can be a significant aspect of this dynamic, even within a single nation. Companies often develop their unique corporate identity, shaped by factors such as work-life balance, communication styles, and hiring practices. For instance, some organizations prioritize long working hours, while others foster a more relaxed atmosphere. Similarly, employee dress codes, communication styles, and philanthropic initiatives can all reveal the nuances of a company's culture.\n\nMoreover, values play a crucial role in shaping a culture's underlying dynamics. Understanding the values that drive a culture – such as the importance of saving face, communal harmony, or hard-driving competitiveness – can significantly inform negotiation strategies. By recognizing these values, negotiators can tailor their approach to resonate with their counterpart's cultural context, increasing the likelihood of successful outcomes.\n\nUltimately, effective negotiation requires a deep appreciation for the complexities of cultural differences. By taking the time to understand the underlying values, biases, and nuances of a culture, negotiators can develop a more effective and empathetic approach, better equipped to navigate the challenges of cross-cultural communication.",
            "The notion of divine non-existence has been a subject of debate throughout history. A notable passage encapsulating this concept is found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This assertion is echoed by both St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas, two prominent thinkers whose arguments for the existence of God are the focus of our discussion. To facilitate a meaningful comparison, we will assume that both philosophers are arguing in favor of the God of the Bible, as any alternative conceptions of a divine being would complicate our analysis. While both thinkers present valid points, a closer examination reveals that neither provides a comprehensive foundation for their respective arguments.\n\nTo illustrate this point, we will first examine St. Anselm's argument. Anselm's reasoning is based on the idea that understanding of God can be found within the human mind. He posits that the notion of God's non-existence is inconceivable, implying that the existence of God can be deduced through introspection. This approach suggests that empirical evidence is not necessary, as the truth of God's existence is perceived as self-evident. This perspective aligns with the concept of faith, which is often associated with the acceptance of truth that may not be readily verifiable through empirical means.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more empirical approach, arguing that the existence of God can be proven through reason and evidence alone. This perspective has implications for evangelism, as it would enable the recruitment of new converts without reliance on faith, instead using logic as a persuasive tool. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments for the existence of God, each focusing on the inherent necessity of God's existence. He illustrates this point using analogies, such as the missing puzzle piece, where the existence of the missing piece can be inferred through logical reasoning, even if it is not directly observable.",
            "A pivotal figure, later known as the Buddha, emerged during the fifth or sixth century BCE. This individual's transformative journey from a life of worldly attachments to attainment of enlightenment laid the groundwork for the development of Buddhism. As the centuries have passed, the faith has undergone significant evolution, manifesting in diverse forms such as the Theravada tradition, which has taken root in countries like Sri Lanka. There, the annual water-cutting ceremony, though not directly outlined in the teachings of the Buddha, holds spiritual significance for both monastic and lay practitioners. These adaptations, ranging from superficial customs to the fundamental tenants of the doctrine, demonstrate the dynamic nature of the Theravada Buddhist community. The community's evolving principles, influenced by both internal and external forces, have been shaped by a complex interplay of factors.\n\nInternal and external forces, key concepts in this discussion, warrant clarification. An internal force is one that originates from within the Buddhist community, encompassing both monastic and lay members. Conversely, external forces arise from non-Buddhist influences. Hostile forces are those that intentionally or unintentionally harm the community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Benign forces, in contrast, aim to neither harm nor assist the community, although their actions may have unintended consequences. These definitions will be employed throughout this examination.\n\nTo grasp the essence of Theravada Buddhism, it is crucial to explore its foundational doctrines. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, comprising the Tripitaka, is comprised of three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, encompassing the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central to these notions are the concepts of Anatta (no permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these tenets is essential for transcending Sansara, the cycle of rebirth and death, which perpetuates itself ceaselessly. Enlightenment also brings an end to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a framework for guiding laypeople's lives, including the five precepts (non-harming, honesty, non-stealing, chastity, and sobriety). For monks, a more extensive set of rules governs their behavior. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the Four Noble Truths.

            "The 57-year-long animosity between the United States and Mexico, spanning from 1836 to 1893 (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145), exemplifies a classic case of a border nation rivalry. The conflict reached a boiling point during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States emerge victorious and secure significant territorial gains, including Texas and the American Southwest. While the war marked the peak of the rivalry, other clashes between the two nations persisted, finally subsiding in the years leading up to World War I.\n\nA fundamental aspect of this prolonged rivalry stemmed from fundamental differences in values, customs, and traditions, as well as conflicting material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This scenario is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship; many nations sharing borders often experience similar tensions due to divergent interests and priorities. As David M. Pletcher (1977) noted, \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-standing American foreign policy challenges\" (p. 41). Geographical proximity has contributed to the enduring nature of these rivalries, particularly in the case of Mexico and Cuba, which have historically been at odds with the US.\n\nThe rift between the two nations was also fueled by religious differences, a common denominator in many historical conflicts. Sally Frahm (2001) observed that, \"In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Americans opposed Catholicism and monarchy, much like their twentieth-century stance against fascism and communism\" (p. 86). This ideological struggle, however, was not merely a disagreement over political systems but rather a clash of values rooted in religious preferences. The legacy of distrust inherited from their colonial past – the English and Spanish empires – hindered the establishment of harmonious diplomatic relations between the US and Mexico.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), there were 17 disputes between Mexico and the US during the 57-year rivalry period, with the majority centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and frontier conflicts. The problems of banditry and lawlessness along the border were eventually alleviated through increased military presence on both sides (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) attributed the decline of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the US and the shift in American ambitions, which transitioned from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 109-110) in the latter part of the 19th Century.",
            "It's been a decade and a half since an unforeseen health crisis suddenly derailed my life's trajectory. At the time, I was working as a nurse, a career choice driven by my childhood experiences of uncertainty and insecurity. The message that resonated with me throughout my formative years was that a stable career in a field like nursing would always be in demand, providing a sense of stability and financial security. However, I had secretly aspired to be a scientist or journalist, perhaps a fusion of both.\n\nDespite my passion for those fields, I chose nursing, and here I am, 15 years later, unable to work and living off of disability benefits. The financial struggles have been relentless, leaving me with little to call my own. Yet, it's the kindness of my family and a select few friends that has allowed me to navigate these challenges. In the face of adversity, I've come to realize the importance of humility and knowing when to ask for help.\n\nMy experience has taught me that life's unpredictable nature means that we will inevitably face emergencies, whether big or small. Preparation is essential, but it's equally crucial to acknowledge that some challenges are too great to overcome alone. I firmly believe that the United States would benefit from a shift in values, moving away from an overreliance on the government and towards a culture of mutual support and trust.\n\nThe notion of \"rugged individualism\" is often touted as the core American value, but history suggests that our ancestors' success during trying times was largely due to the collective efforts of their communities. The pioneers who traversed the American wilderness in wagon trains didn't achieve their goals in isolation. Instead, they relied on one another for support and shared resources.\n\nWhile preparing for the unexpected is wise, it's equally important to cultivate a sense of community. I've assembled a basic disaster preparedness kit, complete with essential supplies like first aid kits, water purification tablets, and protective gear. However, I also believe that building relationships with those around me is just as crucial. If you have the means, consider investing in a small garden or a wood-burning stove – but don't underestimate the value of getting to know your neighbors.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a complex and multifaceted issue. Despite D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that scientists still struggle to quantify the intricacies of organic forms, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of evolution. Recent studies have applied this approach to the development and diversification of mollusk skeletons, with notable contributions from researchers such as Raup and Stanley in 1981. Our investigation explores the potential of mathematical modeling, combined with experimental research, to elucidate the mechanisms governing the pace and direction of evolutionary development in the genus Prunum. We utilized X-ray imaging to identify quantitative characteristics that could be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies, which were then inputted into the CerioShell software program developed by Stone in 1995. By generating hypothetical shell forms, we aimed to define the boundaries within which morphological variation could occur in Prunum. These findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary processes in this group.\n\nThe shell of a mollusk can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional tube that undergoes a continuous transformation through 360 degrees of space over time. This process can be visualized as a series of coiled spirals, known as whorls, which revolve around a central axis referred to as the columella. The columella traverses the central column of the shell, while the whorls are separated by continuous lines called sutures. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and the largest whorl, typically the body whorl, occupies the outermost position in most shells. The spire consists of all whorls except the final one, with the apex representing the terminal point and the base situated at the opposite end. The animal emerges through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various angles, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural perspectives. The standard orientation, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex pointing upwards, is commonly employed. A systematic method for counting whorls involves examining the shell from the apical view and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this reference point, estimating to a quarter of a whorl when necessary.\n\nThe shell can also be perceived as a series of interconnected apertures that traverse time and space as the mollusk builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture through coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, a trajectory can be mapped. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing for the manipulation of parameters and modification of the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality over the past decade has been stagnant. Despite making strides in meeting Millennium Development Goals, such as achieving water and sanitation targets, the country is struggling to make significant improvements in child and maternal health, which is essential for meeting its target goals by 2015.  The multifaceted reasons behind this stagnation will be explored below, highlighting the need to bolster the overall health system rather than focusing solely on programmatic interventions.\n\nNotably, Indonesia has seen an increase in the number of births attended by skilled healthcare workers, with 72% of deliveries now meeting this criterion. However, this metric encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who may not be equipped to handle complicated pregnancies, resulting in a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhaging.  Consequently, the progress made in this area is somewhat misleading, underscoring the need for further action.  Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases among children under five treated by a healthcare professional, and data on postnatal care is incomplete, revealing a concerning trend across the country.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain lower than expected, at approximately 4%.  This rate is particularly concerning, as the disparity between urban and rural areas is striking, with a rate of 7% in urban settings compared to just 2% in rural areas.  This stark contrast highlights the issue of unequal access to healthcare services, with a clear bias towards urban areas.  Another concern is vertical equity, as there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles, indicating that the disadvantaged are facing significant barriers to accessing healthcare due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nConsidering the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how to most effectively address the lack of access to services.  Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize developing targeted program-specific approaches or strengthening the overarching health system without focusing solely on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and children?  While program-specific approaches have the advantage of being more focused and manageable, with faster results, they also have several drawbacks.  A significant drawback is that investing heavily in a particular area can divert resources away from other areas, leading to a shortage of human resources and duplication of services.  For instance, the influx of international funding for HIV/AIDS has had a ripple effect on the family planning sector, leading to a shift in focus and resources.",
            "The Victorian literary canon is distinguished by its meticulous attention to nuance and its preoccupation with the elite social strata of the era.  However, two outliers within this tradition are Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Both novels diverge from the conventional mold by incorporating elements of mystery and the uncanny, which serves to enrich the characterization and provide a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nA pivotal passage from Dickens' work exemplifies this phenomenon: \"And now, a multitude of perplexing thoughts assailed his mind. He seemed to be moving between Sikes and Crackit, who were engaged in a heated dispute; their words echoed in his ears, and when he regained his composure, he found himself conversing with them. Sudden gunshots shattered the air, and a cacophony of cries and shouts erupted. Lights danced before his eyes, and he was whisked away by an unseen force. Amidst this maelstrom, a nagging sense of pain persisted, gnawing at his consciousness.\"\n\nThese novels frequently employ dream sequences or trance-like states to convey the mystery, though the context and purpose vary in each instance. In Oliver Twist, these enigmatic events often offer insight into Oliver's inner struggles, his emotional anguish, and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of Oliver's shooting in chapter 28 is a striking example of this technique. The scene is rendered in vivid detail, as if a dream, while Oliver desperately seeks help. The passage underscores Oliver's lack of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as the precarious state of his health, which is starkly evident through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms Oliver, numbing his senses, and he is borne away by an unseen force, his despair revisited, now a constant companion, intertwined with fear rather than surprise. This event begs the question of whose agency lies behind Oliver's misfortune, as it is clear that it was not his own. Furthermore, this incident contributes to the narrative's portrayal of Oliver's growing sense of defeat, suggesting that he has been broken by the influence of old Fagin, forcing him to accept his despair and diminishing his capacity for resistance.\n\nA haunting passage from Wuthering Heights further illustrates this concept: \"The day passed – day; it was forgotten as soon as it arrived – and night fell once more; a night so oppressive in its stillness and fleeting in its duration.\"",
            "I recall a pivotal experience from several years ago when I worked as a tutor in an after-school program for elementary school students. My primary focus was on assisting students with their academic struggles, particularly in English and reading. One student, a young boy named Adrian, stood out to me. Although he spoke fluent English, he exhibited peculiar difficulties with reading, which puzzled me at first. I hypothesized that his challenges lay not in comprehension but rather in recognizing written English. This epiphany struck me when I met his mother, who spoke only Spanish, and we managed to communicate using my limited Spanish skills. This experience illuminated the complexities of language barriers in education, particularly in regions like California.\n\nBy sharing this story, I aim to highlight the pressing issue of language barriers in schools and its subtleties. Even students with native-like fluency in a language can face significant obstacles when confronted with reading materials. The problem is multifaceted, and its solutions cannot be simplified. In Adrian's case, targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved beneficial. However, for non-native English speakers, the solution is more intricate.\n\nThe dual language system, a widely debated topic, presents a promising approach. Studies have shown that children in bilingual education programs perform better academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation, I argue that such programs can benefit all students, not just those with Spanish as their first language. To implement this effectively, we must consider several factors. While requiring all teachers to be bilingual is impractical, we can provide bilingual support staff to assist in the classroom. This could include tutors, educational aids, or other specialized resources. By combining these measures, we can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment for all students.\n\nBy acknowledging the complexities of language barriers and embracing innovative solutions, we can better support students like Adrian and promote academic success across the board. The key lies in integration, not isolation, of various approaches to address this pressing issue.",
            "As individuals, we've long been confronted with the notion of an existence beyond our own understanding. This abstract concept is frequently discussed in various settings – from Sunday school to temple services or introspective self-discovery. Many people instinctively adopt the faith systems imparted by their parents, while others reject these traditions outright, doubting the existence of anything beyond their own personal realities. Our perspectives on spirituality evolve as we navigate different value structures, often finding new meaning through our individual experiences. We seek illumination in the darkness, striving to break free from the shadows and step into the light.\n\nMy recollection of a conversation with my father is vivid. We sat on the front porch, listening to the rain drumming against the tin roof. The downpour cascaded from the gutters, submerging the plants along the porch's edge. My father, lost in thought, gazed out into the rain with a contemplative expression, his eyes avoiding direct contact. His physical appearance had changed over the past few months – his clothes hung loosely on his frame, and his hair had thinned significantly. The air was heavy with unspoken emotions as I hesitated to discuss my impending loss. Instead, I opted to share a moment of physical comfort, embracing him and sitting closer to his side as we both gazed out into the rain-soaked twilight.\n\nTragedy struck just a few months later, on the fifth day after my 22nd birthday, in December. The grueling treatments had prolonged his life, but failed to alleviate his suffering. I grappled with the concept of a higher power, questioning its benevolence in allowing my father to endure such pain. Alone in the darkness, I refrained from prayer, having lost faith in a deity that seemed to have abandoned me.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to witness my father's passing. Instead, I chose to recall his life and not his death, focusing on the memories of how he lived rather than how he left. I knew my father better than anyone, and I believed he would have wanted me to cherish the time we had, rather than being present during his final moments. For three days, I retreated to the safety of my bed, waiting for the news that would change everything.\n\nThe silence was deafening, as the phone remained still and unresponsive.",
            "The notion of the Gothic Novel as a genre is often paradoxical, embodying both the old and the new. This dichotomy is astutely observed by Ian Watt, who describes it as an \"oxymoron\" in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has been subject to a range of interpretations, from dismissive critiques to enthusiastic acclaim, with some seeing it as lacking depth and others extolling its capacity to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). The pioneering work of Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto played a significant role in shaping the Gothic genre, drawing on both ancient and modern narrative traditions to create a novel that blended the old with the new. Walpole's use of theatrical elements and modern storytelling techniques enabled him to craft a new form of literary expression that he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The genre relies heavily on references to medieval theatre, architecture, and cultural heritage, which were seen as archaic and unsophisticated in the context of emerging modernity.\n\nThe fusion of traditional and modern elements allowed Gothic literature to endure and adapt to changing times, becoming both outdated and new to readers across different eras. One of the key features of the Gothic genre is its representation of chivalry, a medieval concept that emphasized the development of a noble knight. This ideal, characterized by bravery, honor, and competence, is a recurring theme in Gothic literature, particularly in The Castle of Otranto. The chivalric code serves as a means of nostalgia and idealization of the past, foreshadowing the emergence of Romanticism. In Walpole's time, this nostalgia was likely influenced by his disillusionment with the present, which he saw as lacking in the values and morality of the past. This is reflected in the character of Frederic, who embodies the chivalric ideals and is described as a prince who has suffered and been shaped by his experiences.\n\nWalpole's portrayal of Frederic is a masterful blend of traditional chivalric imagery, including his status as a prince, his tragic past, and his supposed martyrdom at the hands of infidels. This portrayal is an early example of the Gothic trope of excess, which would become a hallmark of the genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management encompasses a multifaceted array of processes that govern the trajectory of goods from the initial customer order to the final stages of product distribution. The term itself was first coined in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a forward-thinking consultant, who described the intricate process of planning, executing, and controlling supply chain operations to meet customer demands in a timely and efficient manner. Central to this process are six critical components that serve as the cornerstone of a well-structured supply chain: production, supply, inventory management, location optimization, transportation logistics, and information exchange.\n\nProduction is the foundational step in the supply chain process, setting the tone for the entire operation. It involves a thorough examination of customer requirements, which can be gleaned from market analysis. By understanding market trends and customer needs, managers can make informed decisions regarding product offerings and production volumes. The choice of production location is also crucial, taking into account factors such as volume, quality, and customer satisfaction. To ensure a seamless production process, managers must prioritize scheduling workloads and equipment maintenance, recognizing that even the smallest detail can have far-reaching consequences for the company's bottom line. Efficient planning and execution are essential to avoid costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nSupply is the second key element in the supply chain management framework. It involves making strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may opt to outsource certain processes to external partners, leveraging their specialized skills and expertise to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while maintaining low costs. This strategic approach allows companies to tap into the strengths of various divisions, each with its unique equipment, workforce, and specialties. By doing so, they can optimize their operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.",
            "A disturbing message scrawled on a makeshift sign in Burma, a Southeast Asian nation, has caught the attention of passerby. Ellen Page, known for her poignant portrayal in the film \"Juno,\" stands solitary on a street corner, the cardboard placard held high above her head with a bold, black Sharpie inscription. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been ruled by a ruling junta since 1962, following a military coup d'état. A significant turning point in the country's history occurred in 2007, when a wave of public protests broke out, led by a large number of Burmese monks. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these demonstrations drew international attention, sparking a violent crackdown by the military junta, which targeted monasteries and rounded up foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who lost his life while covering a street protest in September 2007.\n\nThis distressing event is not an isolated incident. The desire for complete control and suppression of dissent has been a recurring theme throughout human history. From ancient civilizations to modern-day governments, the pursuit of absolute power has led to numerous tragic consequences. In the past, Roman emperors claimed divine authority to govern their societies, while in Japan, the emperor is considered a deity, believed to guide his people towards prosperity through technological advancements and spiritual practices. In the present day, high-ranking officials engage in confidential meetings with influential leaders, highlighting the complex relationships between power and governance.\n\nHistorical examples of such authoritarianism include the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students, intellectuals, and labor activists gathered against the government's oppressive rule. Reports of the event's death toll vary significantly, with official estimates ranging from 200 to 300, while eyewitness accounts suggest a much higher number, between 2,000 and 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderates, is another harrowing example. The atrocities committed during WWII, including the persecution of Jews under the Nazi regime, are also a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on the jazz genre stems in large part from his remarkable longevity and the resultant influence on his musical ensemble. While his piano contributions may not be immediately apparent in the selections for this assignment, his compositional prowess stands out for its ability to showcase the unique talents of individual band members. Through his expert crafting of musical frameworks, Ellington empowered soloists to improvise freely while also composing intricate, tightly orchestrated pieces that highlighted the distinct qualities of each band member. Consequently, the collective sound of his orchestra became a hallmark of his work, yielding coherent and original musical textures that suited each piece uniquely. \n\nAs an authority on Ellington's contributions to jazz, the Grove Music dictionary notes his innovative use of voice as a sonic instrument. A notable example of this can be seen in Creole Love Call, which utilizes voice to add depth and timbre without the constraint of lyrics. By doing so, Ellington demonstrates his skill in complementing the styles of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. This deliberate, twelve-bar blues piece, comprising six choruses, exemplifies his approach:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response exchange between the vocalist and reeds, characterized by a smooth, melodic introduction and a rougher, more dramatic conclusion.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands on the melodic theme, incorporating extended blue notes to add emotional depth.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a syncopated piano phrase that underscores the emotional intensity.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble recaptures the essence of the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, marked by the reeds taking the lead in a call-and-response sequence, accompanied by stop-time syncopation from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the opening structure, with the vocalist adopting a growl technique, soloing as if an instrument.\nA final, brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant, novel conclusion courtesy of a trombone.\n\nEllington's incorporation of voice as a means of adding tonal dimension to his compositions is a recurring motif throughout his work.\n\nOne year after Creole Love Call, Ellington combined his skill in crafting tightly orchestrated pieces with his keen sense of tonal color in Hot and Bothered. The call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing masterfully combines the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, yielding a rich, complementary sound. This approach is further refined in It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), where Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone.",
            "There was a void within her that had long defied satisfaction. It began to take shape when she was 14, during the tumultuous transition into adolescence. Three years later, at 17, the yearning still lingered, now with a distinct desire for human connection over abstract concepts. Yet, she found herself disinterested in the prospect of romantic relationships, as if an invisible barrier had been erected, shielding her from the affections of others. Some had attempted to breach this barrier, with awkward and often unsuccessful overtures, but none had managed to pique her interest. She often found herself questioning this phenomenon, searching for a plausible explanation, but no theory seemed satisfactory.\n\nOrdinarily, her home was a tranquil haven. Her parents were level-headed individuals, rarely engaging in conflict with one another or with her. However, they did occasionally disagree about her independent nature and free-spirited personality, which often clashed with their more subdued approach to life. Her parents' calm demeanor was a stark contrast to her own effervescent personality, yet it was her likable and kind nature that had earned her a special place in their hearts.\n\nToday, however, was not a typical day. As she wandered from room to room, seeking inspiration, a sudden, high-pitched cry pierced the air, followed by the unmistakable sound of her mother's voice. She hastened into the kitchen, alarm coursing through her veins as she frantically asked, \"Mom?! What's wrong?!\" Upon entering the room, she was met with the unexpected sight of her mother lying on the floor, wincing in pain as she repeatedly muttered, \"Ow\" in short, labored breaths. Her daughter rushed to her mother's side, placing a supporting hand on her arm, and asked, \"Ouch... sweetie, I need you to take me to the hospital.\" The words were hushed and strained, and her daughter sensed the gravity of the situation. \"Okay, Mom, just point me in the right direction,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the growing unease within her. Her mother's directions were clear, and at that moment, her daughter was grateful for the physical training she had undergone. With a sense of determination, she lifted her mother into the car and set her in the backseat.\n\nThe hospital's sterile atmosphere, heavy with the scent of disinfectant and the faint tang of illness, seemed to amplify the sense of foreboding that hung in the air. But her daughter's anxiety was superseded by her concern for her mother's well-being. She hurriedly escorted her mother to the hospital bed, where a team of medical professionals quickly sprang into action, their faces etched with worry. A gurney was summoned, and her mother was carefully transferred onto it. As the doctors began their assessment, her daughter was left to sit, her anxiety simmering just beneath the surface.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had suffered an accident while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet. She had fallen off a step stool.",
            "The objective of this investigation was to investigate the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, quantified by an alternate Mediterranean diet score, and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. This study focused on the modified Mediterranean diet, which is characterized by a higher intake of plant-based foods, including plant proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, as well as a reduced consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption is also permitted in this dietary pattern.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated an inverse association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, as well as an intervention trial that showed the Mediterranean diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles in obese individuals. However, prior research has not specifically examined the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke mortality.\n\nThis observational study followed a cohort of 74,886 female nurses, aged 38-63 years, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a large-scale prospective study of female nurses in 11 US states. The study collected data over a 20-year period from 1984 to 2004, with participants completing six food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to assess their dietary intake. The FFQs were validated through various methods, including medical and hospital records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. When records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing about 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions.\n\nThe study controlled for potential confounding variables, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, by adjusting for these factors in the analysis. To minimize random variation in individual data and capture long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated from the repeated FFQs. \n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal outcomes. The results indicated that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident heart disease and stroke in women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of heart disease, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal heart disease and strokes combined) were documented. Women in the highest quintile of alternate Mediterranean diet score exhibited a reduced risk for both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked the onset of a severe economic downturn in the United States. As the housing market imploded, unemployment skyrocketed, and many major corporations found themselves on the brink of collapse. The lasting impact of this crisis necessitates an examination of its origins and potential solutions. In essence, the housing market collapse was precipitated by a combination of misguided policy decisions and a fragile financial infrastructure. Specifically, banks and financial institutions were incentivized to issue subprime loans, which were then repackaged and sold as complex financial instruments. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the resulting financial chaos was disproportionately borne by the institutions that had invested in these securities.\n\nA crucial turning point occurred in 1999, during the Clinton administration, when the president sought to bolster his popularity ahead of a re-election bid. In an effort to achieve this goal, the administration relaxed lending regulations, creating an environment conducive to the subprime crisis that would unfold in the following years. Notably, Steven Holmes of the New York Times predicted in 1999 that this course of action could have disastrous consequences, stating that Fannie Mae's \"phenomenal growth in profits\" was being fueled by a \"government-subsidized corporation\" that was \"under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people.\" Holmes astutely recognized the potential risks of this approach, warning that the company \"may run into trouble in an economic downturn.\"\n\nThe structural vulnerabilities of the housing market played a significant role in perpetuating the crisis. The proliferation of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) created a complex web of interconnected financial assets. This, in turn, led to a situation in which U.S. households and financial markets became heavily reliant on the housing market, rendering them acutely vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in prices. Ultimately, the housing bubble burst, causing widespread financial institutions to bear the brunt of the losses. The five largest U.S. investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, representing approximately 30% of the U.S. GDP. The financial fallout was severe, with Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch being acquired at fire-sale prices, Lehman Brothers being dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley being forced to convert to commercial banks subject to stricter regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government conservatorship in September 2008.",
            "The Art of Disclosing: A Cautionary Tale for the Overexpository\n\nIt's a familiar phenomenon – that moment in a story where the writer's creative wings begin to unfold, transporting readers to new heights of wonder or, conversely, inducing a sense of listlessness. Even the most seasoned authors, like Dr. Merlin, have succumbed to the pitfalls of excessive exposition, only to be met with a cacophony of frustration at their digital doorstep.\n\nExposition, as we all know, is the nemesis of engaging storytelling. While it's essential to provide context, there's a fine line between informative passages and narrative overload. Dr. Merlin cautions against allowing exposition to dictate the tempo of your narrative, lest it stifles the very essence of your tale.\n\nThe adage \"Show, don't tell\" is a fundamental principle of good writing, and yet, many authors still falter in this regard. Exposition often masquerades as a harmless indulgence, but in reality, it's a subtle saboteur that can derail even the most promising narratives.\n\nIn film and literature, exposition can manifest as a character's lengthy monologue or, in the case of fiction, the author's own telling of events. A pertinent example is the tale of a heroine whose life is recounted in rapid succession – her meeting, her marriage, her husband's untimely demise. Rather than diving headfirst into the aftermath, the author often devotes an inordinate amount of space to summarizing these events. A more effective approach would be to weave these details into the fabric of the narrative, allowing the reader to develop an emotional connection with the characters and their experiences.\n\nTake the introduction of a new character, for instance. Rather than dumping a plethora of biographical information – military background, current occupation, past marriages, and personal aspirations – consider peppering these details throughout the narrative, allowing them to emerge organically. This approach will create a more nuanced and engaging character, and, ultimately, a more immersive reading experience.\n\nIn short, it's essential to provide substance to the bare bones of your story. Resist the temptation to rush through pivotal moments, and instead, take the time to breathe life into the narrative.

            "I tuned in to two newscasts from Columbus, Ohio on the morning of August 13, 2011. The first, an NBC 4 broadcast, featured a live report. The lead story centered on a domestic assault case in Ashley, Ohio, where a local man named Shad Hostettler had allegedly assaulted his wife. The station's coverage provided a brief overview, stating that multiple stab wounds were involved and that Hostettler had been apprehended. The brevity of the report seemed reasonable, given the developing nature of the story.\n\nThe second story covered an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, in which an 18-year-old victim, Travis Buyers, had been critically injured. The authorities had yet to identify any suspects or make arrests at the time of the broadcast. The SWAT team was investigating the incident. This story seemed relatively short, and one possible reason for this might be the neighborhood in which the shooting occurred. Observing a pattern over the years, I have noticed that certain communities and individuals often receive lesser media attention when they are victims of crime.\n\nThe next segment reported on a shooting incident involving a Med-Flight helicopter, which had sustained damage from a .22 caliber rifle round. The authorities were seeking information from the public to aid in the identification of the perpetrator, offering a $5,000 reward for tips leading to an arrest.\n\nThe forecast for the weekend predicted scattered thunderstorms on Saturday, with temperatures ranging from the mid-to-low eighties. The brevity of this segment may have been intentional, as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nThe newscast also covered a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie, was said to be approximately 6 feet tall and weighed around 150 pounds. The emphasis on the perpetrator's skin tone and physical appearance struck me as unusual.\n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a report on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating the sentence, the newscaster referred to the 300-month prison term. I am unsure of the reasoning behind this choice of words. Additionally, the report mentioned Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, which, in my opinion, was not particularly relevant to the story.",
            "In the complex tapestry of human relationships, one bond stands out for its peculiar depth and intensity: the bond between brothers. This connection, born of shared experiences and mutual understanding, is a multifaceted entity that encompasses a wide range of emotions, from the purest love to the darkest cruelty. It is in the most trying of circumstances that the true nature of this bond is revealed, often with far-reaching consequences. The intricate dance of emotions that defines the brotherly bond can be a double-edged sword, leading to profound self-discovery and a deeper understanding of one's own character.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, delving into the labyrinthine emotions that accompany it. Against the backdrop of a lush, vividly described landscape, two brothers embark on a perilous journey that is ultimately doomed to fail. The tension between bitter disappointment and intense pride reaches a boiling point in a climactic confrontation, resulting in a tragedy that leaves one brother alive. Through the protagonist's character development and interactions with his brother, as well as the narrative's introspective tone, the novel effectively conveys the complex interplay of emotions that shape the protagonist's actions.\n\nAt the heart of the protagonist's motivations is a singular emotion: pride. From their earliest encounters, the protagonist harbors a deep-seated resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. The protagonist's idealized vision of brotherhood, which includes sharing exciting experiences like exploring the wilderness and engaging in physical activities, is cruelly shattered by Doodle's fragile health. The protagonist's frustration and anger are palpable, even extending to the point of considering a heinous act. However, a simple gesture from Doodle – a smile – momentarily assuages the protagonist's darker impulses, revealing a glimmer of love and compassion that lies beneath his resentment. This dichotomy highlights the complexity of the protagonist's emotions, underscoring the idea that even in the depths of despair, there is always a spark of goodness that can be fanned into flame.",
            "As the cerebral cortex has evolved, so too have the analogies employed to elucidate its intricate functions. Initially, it was likened to a wax tablet, then augmented by the metaphor of a papyrus scroll, followed by the more mechanistic notion of a book, and most recently, a computer has been invoked. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that the utility of these analogies is inherently limited and may lead to unintended inferences.\n\nPerception begins with the transformation of sensory stimuli into electrochemical signals by the sensory organs. These signals undergo iterative processing through the brain's algorithms, combining both hierarchical and feedback-driven mechanisms. For instance, when observing a black box on a white background, the hierarchical processing integrates basic features such as color, orientation, and spatial boundaries to identify the object as a box. Meanwhile, the feedback-driven mechanism utilizes pre-existing knowledge to refine the recognition and distinguish it from a box-shaped void in the background.\n\nInformation processing reaches a critical juncture when an attentional filter determines the signal's salience and allocates cognitive resources accordingly. As an illustration, although the brain processes every individual blade of grass when one gazes at their shoes, a healthy attentional filter prevents individual blades from being consciously noted, whereas the name \"John\" might be picked out amidst background noise. This dynamic interplay between processing stages is recurrently modulated by attention.\n\nFor information to be processed, it must first be stored. The brain employs multiple forms of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information undergoes encoding, which varies depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal information can be encoded based on its structural characteristics, phonetic properties, or semantic meaning. Subsequently, information must be maintained. Research on animal subjects suggests that working memory, which has a duration of approximately 20 seconds, relies on a transient electrical signal traversing a specific series of neurons. The storage of long-term memories is hypothesized to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nDifferent theories have been proposed to explain the cerebral organization of knowledge, drawing from human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, interconnected according to their semantic relationships. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which could be linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, serves as a scathing critique of the emerging threat of technological advancements and the capitalist systems that perpetuate them. In Huxley's vision of the future, societal values prioritize communal harmony over individual autonomy, with citizens conditioned from birth to pursue immediate gratification above all else. This collective acceptance of a predetermined fate is orchestrated by the enigmatic World Controller, who wields control over the masses through a rigid ideology.\n\nWhen examined through the lens of Marxist thought, Huxley's work reveals a profound skepticism towards the capitalist systems of his time. The author employs Marxist terminology, such as 'homogeny' and 'reification,' to illustrate the insidious effects of unchecked economic development. Huxley's use of these terms underscores his concern that the capitalist system perpetuates a false sense of reality, where individuals are disconnected from their true social and economic relationships.\n\nThe concept of false consciousness, a central tenet of Marxist theory, is exemplified in Huxley's portrayal of the working-class citizens in Brave New World. These individuals are manipulated into prioritizing their own self-interest over any notion of collective solidarity or social awareness. The conditioning of the population through hypnopædia reinforces this notion, as citizens are conditioned to crave consumption, indulgence, and conformity above all else. This is a deliberate tactic of control, orchestrated by the World Controller, to maintain the status quo and preserve the hegemony of the ruling elite.\n\nHuxley's depiction of social hierarchy in Brave New World is a masterful commentary on the oppressive nature of capitalism. The lower classes, exemplified by the Delta and Gamma castes, are oblivious to the machinations of the ruling class, while the upper classes, represented by the Alphas and Betas, are either complicit in their own oppression or apathetic towards the plight of others. The relationships between characters in the novel are superficial and lack depth, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism has stifled human connections and emotional expression.\n\nFurthermore, Huxley's work highlights the ways in which capitalist systems breed complacency and obedience among the working class. The societal classes are content with their roles in the hierarchy, further reinforcing the Marxist notion that the proletariat are conditioned to believe in their own superiority, as long as they conform to the expectations of their peers and consume according to the dictates of the ruling class.",
            "As a member of the University Park community for the past two and a half years, I have become increasingly aware of the challenges associated with navigating our campus. The sprawling nature of the school, combined with its rapid expansion, has made getting from one destination to another a time-consuming and often arduous task. My personal experience of traveling from my off-campus residence in Stuart Hall to various classes, such as those in the Willard building, has sometimes taken up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when weather conditions are unfavorable. I recall speaking to an alumnus who shared with me the history of the East Halls dormitory complex, which was once isolated from the rest of campus by a large tract of undeveloped land. However, this open space has since given way to new sports facilities, buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and surrounding residential units. As the campus continues to grow and evolve, it is crucial to address the issue of mobility.\n\nI recently engaged in a conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a several-year hiatus. He expressed his renewed enthusiasm for this mode of transportation by remarking, \"Bikes are my go-to; for a while, it wasn't the most popular option, but it's the most efficient way to get around.\" Not only does cycling offer physical benefits, but it also allows individuals to cover significant distances without expending excessive time or energy. In fact, a nutritious meal and some moderate exercise can easily cover 30 miles or more. As someone who now resides off-campus, I can attest to the value of owning a bike. What has been my most practical decision this year has been purchasing a bicycle, allowing me to travel from my residence to Thomas building, which is approximately a 25-minute walk, in just 5 minutes when I pedal at a brisk pace. Nevertheless, I have encountered challenges while navigating Pollock Road, which offers the most direct route to Thomas building from my home. While walking has its benefits, I find that I am too busy to devote the necessary time to this mode of transportation. Without my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for attending classes and other activities, resulting in an additional 30-40 minutes of travel time each day. Over the course of a week, this would translate to over 2.5 hours, which I simply cannot afford to spare."
