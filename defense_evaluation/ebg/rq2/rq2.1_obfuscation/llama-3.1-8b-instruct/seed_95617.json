            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue my academic and professional ambitions in social work, I am drawn to the field's potential for personal and professional growth, particularly within the realm of the Division of Family and Children Services. My objective is to create a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, as well as to provide support to families experiencing turmoil. My core values, which are deeply ingrained in my personal and professional philosophy, include a commitment to service, respect, and a steadfast dedication to upholding the highest standards of ethics. These values are not merely professional ideals; they are an integral part of my personal identity and inform my approach to building meaningful relationships with others and continually refining my professional skills to remain effective in my field.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have been driven by a strong desire to make a difference in the lives of others. However, I struggled to identify a clear career path that aligned with my passions. As I transitioned from high school to college, I witnessed firsthand the ways in which individuals often cope with adversity in less-than-ideal ways. This experience, combined with my academic foundation in psychology, led me to take a deliberate break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. It was during this time that I had a profound encounter with a young individual who was struggling with the aftermath of abuse. This experience not only deepened my understanding of the complexities of social issues but also instilled in me a sense of purpose and direction. I began to seriously consider a career in social work as a means of addressing the needs of vulnerable populations.\n\nOne of the key principles that underpins social work is the pursuit of social justice. In our society, we often prioritize the notion of individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms and expectations. I believe that this dichotomy is a pressing issue that warrants attention. As someone who values uniqueness and self-expression, I have consistently challenged societal norms throughout my academic and personal life. Whether through artistic expression, activism, or community engagement, I have consistently advocated for social justice and equality. My experiences have taught me the importance of staying true to one's values and principles, even in the face of adversity. I am committed to continuing this work in my future career as a social worker.",
            "This paper presents an examination of the biological and sociocultural frameworks that underpin insomnia, a complex sleep disorder. The biological model focuses on the interplay between genetic inheritance and physiological factors, while the sociocultural model explores the impact of environmental influences, including demographic, socio-economic, and ethnic factors. This review will delve into the research underlying these models, analyzing the strengths and limitations of each study and its relevance to our understanding of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a secondary sleep disorder related to a mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias encompassing insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, and other conditions not specified. Insomnia is characterized by persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias involve behavioral and physiological anomalies, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and other conditions not specified.\n\nThis analysis will focus on the biological model, which posits that sleep disorders are influenced by genetic and physiological factors. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A recent study on mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons is essential for modulating sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of the receptor reduces anxiety and induces sleep. Furthermore, administration of the GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that this receptor plays a critical role in sleep regulation. These findings imply that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of sleep disorders in humans. The sociocultural implications of this research are significant, as the inheritance of a phenotype affecting the GABAB receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, with far-reaching consequences for daily life, including academic and professional performance.",
            "The complexities of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) encompass a multifaceted spectrum of auditory processing difficulties. This paper will delve into three key areas of CAPD: its definition, diagnosis, and the role of educators in supporting students with this condition within mainstreamed classrooms.\n\nAt its core, CAPD revolves around how the central nervous system processes auditory information, which is a critical aspect of our ability to interpret and understand the world around us (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, CAPD specifically refers to the brain's ability to decipher auditory signals, which is essential for distinguishing speech from background noise and recognizing patterns within sound (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). While individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing, their brains struggle to allocate and prioritize auditory input, resulting in difficulties with auditory processing.\n\nHistorically, researchers have made significant strides in understanding CAPD. The concept dates back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first identified \"auditory imperception\" as a critical aspect of communicative disorders (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Notably, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered standardized testing for children with CAPD in the early 1950s, while Kimura's groundbreaking work on dichotic testing in 1961 shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying auditory perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A pivotal conference in 1977 further galvanized research into CAPD in children.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD exhibit a range of processing challenges, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple auditory events, recognizing patterns, and differentiating tone and pitch (Ferre). They may also struggle to differentiate between competing sounds, synthesize sound cues, and understand the sequence of auditory information (Ferre). These challenges can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty identifying sarcasm or detecting changes in speech.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a comprehensive assessment, which may involve systematic observation, questionnaires, and performance on standardized tests (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a variety of tools to evaluate auditory function, including tests that present multiple stimuli and require the patient to differentiate specific items (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). While there is no single, widely accepted diagnostic tool or known cause for CAPD, researchers continue to refine their understanding of this complex condition through ongoing research and testing.",
            "Deception may be an effective tool for achieving short-term goals, but it can also lead to long-term consequences. In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the character's reliance on disguise ultimately forces them to confront the tension between self-preservation and relationships with others. The process of shedding a false identity can be complicated by the risk of alienation, as those who have been deceived may not take kindly to the revelation. This dichotomy is particularly pronounced in situations where deception involves a reversal of gender roles.\n\nOne of the most vexing aspects of this phenomenon is the underlying motivation behind the adoption of a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to pose as a man is driven by a desire for self-protection in an unfamiliar environment. As she navigates her new circumstances, Viola's disguise allows her to establish a sense of control, but it also creates a sense of disconnection from her female peers. This isolation is further complicated by the mistaken assumption of Olivia, who falls in love with the object of her affection under the assumption that he is a man. Meanwhile, Viola must also contend with the unrequited romantic feelings she develops for Orsino.\n\nOn one level, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on the power of deception to uncover suppressed emotions. The characters' responses to Viola/Cesario's presence suggest that they are forced to confront their own desires and biases. For instance, Olivia's shifting affections from Cesario to Sebastian raise questions about the nature of her attraction to the character. Is she drawn to Cesario's male persona, or does she harbor feelings for women? While it is unlikely that Shakespeare intended to portray Olivia as a closeted individual, her character can be seen as a satirical representation of the societal norms of the time, which often judged people based on surface-level appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by Olivia's ease in transitioning from romantic interest to familial affection for Viola, highlighting the fluidity of her character's emotions and her tendency to prioritize social appearances over genuine connections.",
            "The German colonial regime has been characterized by a complex and often brutal nature, as exemplified by the devastating treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, it is essential to acknowledge that no colonial empire can be reduced to a single descriptor, as the German colonial administration exhibited varying policies and approaches across its territories. Similarly, educational initiatives in the colonies were diverse, ranging from established state schools to missionary-led institutions. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of African residents with a high level of literacy and education.\n\nIn contrast, German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a starkly different picture. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively promoted education through state-run institutions, the responsibility for educating the native population in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary organizations that received limited government support. The administration did, however, invest considerable resources in European education, establishing a network of state schools and providing significant backing for missionary-led institutions. These educational policies had long-lasting effects on South West Africa's development, even after the end of German rule. Unfortunately, the outcomes were far from uniform, with the majority of the population in South West Africa remaining largely uneducated and illiterate. Various socio-economic and political factors contributed to this disparate experience, and this paper aims to further explore these factors by examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial officials towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, with a significant portion written in German and published in the early 20th century. These early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in place within the colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and delving deeper into specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems between colonies. Cohen's comprehensive study of education in South West Africa and East Africa provides valuable insights into the divergent educational approaches employed in these regions. Cohen attributes many of the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to the presence of a substantial settler population.\n\nGeographical conditions in South West Africa were relatively favorable, with a moderately temperate climate and arid desert regions. The European population of the territory reflected this relatively hospitable environment, with around 15,000 settlers residing in South West Africa by 1913, in contrast to the approximately 5,336 settlers in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has resulted in a rich tapestry of diverse genres, each with its own unique characteristics and sub-genres. Heavy metal, a genre that has emerged over the past 40 years, stands out for its remarkable adaptability and emotional depth. By embracing its darker aspects, metal has carved out a distinct niche for itself within the music landscape. This trajectory is a testament to the genre's ability to evolve and incorporate elements from other styles, resulting in a diverse array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nThe heavy metal movement has become increasingly complex, with numerous sub-niches and influences from various genres. To fully appreciate the breadth of metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the factors that have shaped its development. At its core, metal is a genre characterized by its intensity, often manifesting as a \"music of excess\" - louder, faster, and more complex than its predecessors. Skilled musicianship is a defining feature of metal, with many artists pushing the boundaries of technical proficiency.\n\nThe genre's association with substance use is also a notable aspect of its history. The mid-1970s saw a surge in psychedelic drug use, which influenced the creation of some of the most innovative and experimental metal records. This period's emphasis on darker, more visceral qualities resonated with listeners who were seeking a more authentic expression of the human experience. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on intense emotions and brooding introspection, further enriching the genre's sonic landscape. The following lyrics from Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the earliest heavy metal tracks, illustrate the genre's affinity for exploring the darker aspects of the human experience:\n\nThis thought-provoking song, penned by the Beatles, showcases the band's ability to craft a heavy, emotive sound that resonated with the times. Released on the iconic White Album, Helter Skelter was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier offerings, demonstrating the Beatles' desire to push the boundaries of their music and assert their own unique style.",
            "In the years preceding the Surrealist movement, a lesser-known figure, Henri Rousseau, was striving for artistic expression that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only captures the wonder of a woman immersed in a dreamlike world but also embodies Rousseau's own personal aspirations and internal conflicts. Having long coveted recognition from his peers and the art world, Rousseau found himself caught between the desire to conform to established styles and the longing to forge his own unique path. This dichotomy is poignantly reflected in The Dream, a work that encapsulates the artist's lifelong struggle to reconcile the need for validation with the urge to innovate.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream in this context, it is essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born in 1844 in the French town of Laval, he hailed from a family of modest means, with his father working as a successful merchant. Despite the absence of formal artistic training, Rousseau's life took a dramatic turn when he lost his young wife and several children, leaving him with a deep sense of sorrow and a yearning for a fresh start. Painting became his solace and a means to reinvent himself. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasantry, Rousseau's work is characterized by a more grounded, folkloric sensibility, reflecting the hopes and aspirations of the common man.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance by the art world is understandable, given his late start in life and the presence of more established artists, including Henri Matisse, who was gaining recognition during the same period. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while both artists operated in the same sphere, their motivations and styles diverged significantly. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to create works that were conventionally appealing, hoping to be acknowledged by the Artiste Français.",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has long fascinated scholars, who often cite a deep-seated connection between truth and beauty. This notion is not merely a product of philosophical speculation, but rather a profound observation grounded in human experience. As John Keats astutely noted in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our understanding of the world is shaped by education and experience, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics often defies conventional instruction. Both endeavors seek to describe, rather than prescribe, and our studies of morality and beauty aim to elucidate the underlying reasons behind the beauty of a piece of art or literature, or the moral implications of an action.\n\nOne notable aspect of this connection is the inherent difficulty in capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful through critical analysis. When evaluating a work of art, such as da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may focus on elements like composition, context, and cultural significance, but these factors ultimately fall short of explaining why the piece is considered great. Instead, our descriptions of art and literature often begin with a vague yet intuitive sense of recognition, as in the phrase, \"There's just something about it.\" This \"something\" is precisely what eludes complete description, and it is this transcendent quality that underlies the power of art and morality.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's observation that a story can convey something that cannot be expressed in other ways reinforces this notion. Similarly, Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be fully expressed and is instead transcendental underscores its elusive nature. This je ne sais quoi, this intangible yet essential quality, is the common thread that weaves ethics and aesthetics together.\n\nThe intersection of ethics and aesthetics is further complicated by the fact that both impact us on a fundamental, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. Our experiences of beauty and morality are ineffable, existing beyond the realm of rational explanation. This connection is particularly pronounced in literature, which, as McKean notes, is distinguished by its unique moral quality. Literature's ability to convey values and inspire reflection makes it a vital part of our shared human experience.",
            "Germany, a nation boasting a distinct cultural identity, is a testament to the rich tapestry of influences that have woven together its history. The country's unique blend of traditions can be observed in various cities, from the southwestern town of Munich nestled at the foot of the Alps to the northern port city of Kiel, situated on the Baltic Sea. Similarly, the Rhine River city of Cologne and the Saxon city of Dresden, located on the Elbe River, both reflect this cultural diversity.\n\nGermany's complex heritage stems from its diverse origins, shaped by various tribes and influences. The term \"Germania\" refers to the ancestral homeland of the German people. The etymology of this name is a subject of ongoing debate among scholars, with multiple theories emerging.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, the name \"Germania\" may have originated from the Tungrian tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus in his work \"Germania\" written in 98 AD. Another theory suggests that Julius Caesar derived the term from the Gauls, using it to distinguish between conquered and unconquered territories in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War). Caesar noted in the first book of his work, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus further elaborated on the origins of the Germans in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (On the Origin and Situation of the Germans), written around 98 AD. He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external migrations or intermarriage. The Romans, Tacitus wrote, would not have voluntarily emigrated to Germany due to its harsh climate, geography, and unyielding culture.\n\nDuring the 1st century AD, Germanic tribes began to interact with the Roman Empire, primarily through trade and military service. They would often trade goods obtained from their homeland and offer their battle-hardened skills to the Roman army in exchange for stable opportunities within the Roman Empire. This initial contact laid the groundwork for a complex and dynamic relationship between the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire, which would eventually shape the course of European history.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind was a blank slate, absorbing the scene before me without attachment. My thoughts flowed in and out with the pace of a gentle stream, never lingering long enough to form a cohesive idea. My mind functioned with a smooth efficiency, allowing me to experience the world around me without the burden of personal interpretation. \n\nIt was during this period that I came across a book, 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,' which offered a unique perspective on the creative process. I had long been fascinated by art, a fascination that began when I was a young child. The book provided a comprehensive guide to understanding art, from the basic tools to the cognitive processes that underlie our perception of visual information. One technique that resonated with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying complex compositions and allowing for a more nuanced understanding of form and structure. \n\nAs I stood before my subject, however, I found myself unable to apply this technique. The scene before me was overwhelming, and I felt a sense of awe wash over me. I thought of the great masters – Picasso's blue period, Monet's affinity for greenery, the Renaissance masters' use of color – and I felt a sense of trepidation. Could I, on my own, create something worthy of the title 'artistic'? \n\nWith a deep breath, I reached for my tool of choice and began to create. My hand moved with a subtle intensity, my muscles flexing as I brought my vision to life. Water flowed, serene and calm. My hand clenched and released, the motion growing more urgent with each passing moment. My hand struck the handle of the toilet, but the stubborn mass refused to budge. \n\nI stood there, mop in hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie knotted uncomfortably around my neck. I surveyed the scene before me, a mess of processed matter left behind by someone else. The air was heavy with the stench of neglect. I stood there, lost in thought, as I pondered the nature of my surroundings. \n\nIt was then that I decided to take action. With a deep breath, I gripped the end of the toilet paper roll and began to twist it into a makeshift mitten. I stood up straight, then bent at the waist, my hand dipping slowly into the bowl with the deliberation of a chef preparing a meal. The motion was almost meditative, a moment of calm in the midst of chaos.",
            "A disturbing trend is unfolding on American roads: the alarming number of teenage fatalities attributed to vehicular accidents. Several key factors contribute to this epidemic, and research from the National Institutes of Health sheds light on the brain's unpreparedness for the risks associated with driving. Moreover, inexperience plays a significant role, leading to higher rates of accidents, rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents. Studies have shown that when teenagers drive with their peers, the risks escalate, as exemplified by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the number of hours teens can drive and prohibit minor passengers. However, these measures, in my opinion, serve only as temporary solutions. The underlying issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are disproportionately vulnerable to the perils of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that a significant proportion of individuals under the age of 19-20 exhibit a predilection for risk-taking due to thrill-seeking tendencies. This finding underscores the need to delay licensing until such tendencies have begun to subside.\n\nConsidering this information, it is reasonable to reevaluate the current licensing system. One potential approach involves increasing the minimum age for obtaining a standard driver's license to 18 or older. This could be achieved by providing driver's education classes in schools and maintaining provisional permits prior to full licensure. A uniform national standard could be established, based on existing state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. By adopting a uniform national policy, we can reduce the staggering number of teen driver fatalities and ensure a safer driving environment across the country.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking concept; rather, it is a sensible solution grounded in empirical evidence and research. By taking a proactive approach to addressing this issue, we can safeguard the lives of countless teenagers and prevent what could be a catastrophic increase in traffic accidents in the coming years, particularly as the Baby Boomer generation's children reach driving age and join the roads in large numbers by 2010.",
            "In my exploration of the Library of Congress's repository of early Edison films, I chose to examine the collection of trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen films in total, most of which utilized clever editing techniques to create the illusion of something extraordinary. My focus was on deciphering the underlying structures that governed these trick films and identifying the anomalies that emerged in later examples. \n\nGenerally speaking, the early trick films were rooted in a specific aesthetic: they were composed within a fixed, frontal frame, characterized by stationary camera work, and adhered to a strict narrative structure. This involved long and medium shots, and a clear separation between each individual concept or event. However, some films from the early 20th century began to deviate from this model by incorporating more complex narrative techniques.\n\nOne of the defining features of the trick films was their consistent use of an interior set within a frontal frame. The camera remained stationary, never moving to follow actors or objects within the scene. This compositional style drew inspiration from the theatrical tradition, where it was commonly used in stage and vaudeville performances, as well as in magic shows. As a result, the actors in these films tended to move only horizontally, never approaching or receding from the camera. \n\nThe film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) exemplifies this characteristic, where characters enter from the right-hand side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains stationary, not following them.\n\nGiven the frontal composition style, shots in these films predominantly consisted of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were never used, and this was likely due to the influence of theatre and vaudeville, where the entire performance was visible within the frame of the stage. In line with this tradition, actors rarely, if ever, moved towards the camera, making close-ups impossible.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to a narrative structure that equated one conceptual shot with a single physical shot. This limited the length of these films to a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. Consequently, the trick films tended to focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick-switching sequences. However, a closer examination often reveals that a single conceptual shot can actually be composed of several joined shots, aimed at creating an illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, is a prime example. A detailed analysis reveals the exact moment where the physical shot containing Mary's \"decapitated\" head begins, even though the entire film is conceptually a single shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a stalwart advocate of the virtues inherent to Republicanism, driven by a profound dedication to the principles of individual liberty and limitations on government power. As an agriculturalist by trade, his profession and brief foray into politics instilled in him a stalwart commitment to upholding the values of a self-sufficient agrarian system. This foundational perspective shaped his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system, as he sought to preserve and promote the integrity of what he deemed the most honorable of occupations.\n\nTaylor believed that the nascent United States presented an unparalleled opportunity to forge an exemplary system of governance, unencumbered by the constraints of established tradition. He firmly believed in the inherent, interconnected nature of human rights, positing that the deprivation of one right would compromise the integrity of all, and thus, these rights should remain beyond the reach of government interference. He posited that the notion of a \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical prowess and cunning would dominate, but that in a civilized society, this hierarchy must not prevail.\n\nTo create a society that balances the inherent duality of human nature – comprising both good and evil – Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges and accommodates these complexities. He adhered to a rigorous moral dichotomy, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agricultural prosperity, and regulate capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be influenced by avarice and self-interest. Taylor posited that self-interest, while a fundamental driver of human behavior, becomes malevolent when it prioritizes the interests of sub-groups over the common good. A well-designed government was necessary to harness man's innate propensity for evil, while vigilantly monitoring its own actions to prevent the introduction of destructive principles.\n\nLike many ardent Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict, literal interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited Federal government with powers explicitly enumerated in the document. He recognized that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially despotic, yet cautioned that a simplistic, literal approach could lead to corruption. Furthermore, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly characterized the country as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon reviewing the data presented in Figure 17, a noticeable decrease in commuter log submissions became apparent during the third month of the project. This decline was somewhat concerning, and pinpointing the exact cause proved challenging. Several factors likely contributed to this decrease. The onset of winter at a New England campus typically leads to a decline in bicycle and pedestrian commutes, which may account for some of the drop. Additionally, the end of the fall semester coincided with the month of December, a time when students and faculty are usually preoccupied with schoolwork, grading, and other academic obligations, potentially pushing the commuter log to the backburner. Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, accompanied by a month-long break for students and faculty, resulting in a decrease in campus attendance.\n\nThe subsequent resumption of classes in late January may have also played a role in the low number of log submissions for that month. It is also possible that the natural enthusiasm for a new project may wane over time, leading to decreased participation. To combat this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign that aimed to revitalize the initiative. This effort resulted in an increase in log submissions for that month, indicating that targeted interventions can indeed help reinvigorate the project.\n\nAnother challenge we faced was the entrenched cultural preference for driving personal vehicles, which can make it difficult to encourage alternative modes of commuting. To mitigate this, we offered prizes in the form of gift cards to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. While these incentives were effective, it would be interesting to explore the impact of more substantial rewards, such as offering bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric vehicles. This could have helped to counteract the decline in engagement observed during the project. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, and it is possible that increasing the rewards over time may have had a more significant impact. For instance, announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles and hybrid cars, in December and January, respectively, may have sustained participation levels.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument that tracks a specific index, commodity, or a diverse portfolio of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on an exchange like individual stocks. This hybrid vehicle combines the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of single stock ownership, including the ability to engage in short sales, margin purchases, and transactions as low as a single share. While these perks are highly appealing, the expense ratios of ETFs are notably lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, investors should be aware that trading ETFs involves paying a commission, similar to buying individual stocks. Furthermore, the availability of a wide range of ETFs allows investors to select from various investment options.\n\nA case in point is the ETF IHF, which warrants closer examination. To determine whether owning a single ETF can replicate the benefits of a diversified portfolio and whether there are more optimal configurations of the constituent stocks, we will compare the top 10 holdings of the ETF IHF to the top 10 stocks in the underlying index. This exercise will provide valuable insights into the representativeness of the top 10 holdings and their potential to deliver superior returns and reduced risk.\n\nTo streamline the analysis, we have focused on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is the breakdown of the top 10 holdings along with their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge the effectiveness of the top 10 holdings in representing the ETF IHF, we have calculated their individual contributions to the Beta and Return of a hypothetical portfolio consisting of these stocks, weighted according to their holdings in the ETF. The results are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nA noteworthy observation from the chart is that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would have yielded a 6.11% higher return compared to the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF, indicating a lower level of risk. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with reduced volatility. However, it is essential to determine whether these results are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their collective volatility to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is often cited as a standout work among his oeuvre. Notably, the term \"Thulé\" appears in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott's research, this word has its origins in Virgil, who used it to describe a mythical island situated north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world in ancient Greek geography. However, a more contemporary source also merits consideration. Poe was known for his fascination with German literature.\n\nThis connection to Virgil's work is significant because it highlights Poe's literary influences, which extend beyond his American contemporaries. As Keith Sagar notes in his study of Poe's connection to European literature, the American poet was deeply interested in the works of German authors, including Goethe. Karl J. Arndt's book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" explores the similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe's work.\n\nA 19th-century literary encyclopedia, \"The Oxford Companion to English Literature,\" provides insight into Goethe's literary career. Goethe was a celebrated writer of poetic drama, particularly in his epic \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife gives him a goblet, only to pass away soon after. The king's grief is so intense that he becomes a recluse, drinking heavily and eventually decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Both characters grapple with loss and find solace in drinking. This connection may suggest that Goethe's work influenced Poe's writing, particularly in his use of similar narrative motifs. Furthermore, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land\" and in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" The poem \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as a companion piece to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thulé, characterized by darkness, loneliness, and a world drained of color. These themes are eerily reminiscent of the King of Thulé, who is also grappling with loss and isolation.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, it is likely that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. Tennyson's own writing style and themes may have contributed to Poe's interest in the German author. Moreover, the widespread reproduction and translation of Goethe's works in the 19th century would have made his writing accessible to a broader audience, including Poe.",
            "In California, a shopper who suffered an injury after slipping on an applesauce spill at a grocery store might potentially receive punitive damages if they can show that the store manager acted with a reckless disregard for the potential harm caused by allowing the spill to remain uncleaned. A court would be unlikely to dismiss out of hand the claim for punitive damages made by Jennifer Palmer, who slipped and fell on the spill at D&D Markets. To justify an award of punitive damages, Palmer would need to present evidence that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the potential harm that could result from allowing the spill to remain uncleaned. \n\nThe fact that Martin, the store manager, knew of the spill twice, at 5:00 pm and 5:15 pm, but failed to address it due to his dinner break, provides a strong basis for Palmer's argument. Furthermore, the store had experienced five slip-and-fall incidents prior to Palmer's accident, which suggests that Martin was aware of the potential hazards and should have taken steps to mitigate them. While it is debatable whether the manager's actions were malicious, the fact that the store had experienced multiple incidents in 2009 and failed to take adequate measures to maintain store safety weighs in Palmer's favor.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle, but Martin declined to address it, citing his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reported the spill to Martin, but he still failed to take action. It was not until 30 minutes later that the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The California Civil Code defines malice as conduct that is intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have found malice when a defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and willfully failed to avoid those consequences, demonstrating a reckless disregard for the safety of others.",
            "It has been four years since I had the opportunity to take a course in Islamic studies at my alma mater.  A recurring theme in that class was the debated notion of whether Islam is inherently a hostile faith.  This question remains increasingly pertinent today, particularly in light of the significant shifts in media portrayals of Islam and extremism over the past two decades.  The prospect of a presidential candidate with a Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unthinkable in the early 2000s.  In examining the life of the Prophet Muhammad, I've come to realize that the portrayal in his biography diverges from the common perception of his character.  Initially, I associated Muhammad with coercive tactics, forcing non-Muslims to convert to Islam through conquest.  However, the biography presents a more nuanced image of Muhammad as a misunderstood figure who conveyed his message through humility and compassion, drawing followers through personal encounter rather than coercion.\n\nI've also observed intriguing parallels between the lives and teachings of Jesus and Muhammad.  One example that stands out is the account of Muhammad multiply bread and milk to feed a group of forty men.  This narrative style, which emphasizes Muhammad's humility and lack of need for demonstration, has led me to wonder whether the intention was to downplay the significance of Jesus' miracles and teachings.  This perceived attempt to equate Muhammad's story with that of Jesus raises questions about the legitimacy of such a comparison.\n\nFurthermore, I've noticed that the biography often relies on secondary accounts of events, which can undermine the credibility of the narrative.  While the authors' intention may have been to provide testament to the truth of the stories, this approach can also create skepticism and raise suspicions about the validity of the information.  What bothers me most about this work, however, is its attempt to elevate Muhammad to a level of moral perfection, portraying him as wise, gentle, and endearing.  Historical records, however, suggest a more complex picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I often wonder whether modern Muslims are aware of the historical context surrounding his life.",
            "Throughout the history of Christianity, the principles laid down by Jesus during his lifetime have gradually become lost in the development of the faith.  If we examine the trajectory of Christian thought, a pattern emerges of increasing divergence from its foundational roots.  Today, we are witnessing a heightened awareness and a progressive shift in societal attitudes.  While traditionalists may resist any departures from established doctrine, their influence is unlikely to dictate the broader trajectory of the faith.  In the years to come, Christians are likely to exhibit a growing interest in uncovering the authentic essence of their faith, distinguishing the original teachings of Jesus from the subsequent additions and interpretations that have accumulated over time.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but ultimately, it will eventuate in a significant reversal of the dominant trend in Christian history.  A movement will emerge, steadily stripping away layers of doctrine, much like a hands of time moving in reverse, until only the core principles of Jesus' message remain.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will likely lead to a widespread shift towards a more fundamental understanding of the faith, with adherents reverting to a more pristine, authentic expression of the Christian vision.  The established church will continue to play a crucial role in guiding this process, albeit with a perspective shaped by a more streamlined, unified understanding of the faith.  As a result, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to a greater uniformity of belief and practice.  Instead of a multiplicity of perspectives and traditions, we will witness a growing convergence of views and practices across regions, denominations, and other divisions.  Historical precedents illustrate that such reversals can occur; for instance, the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually became a Christian-dominated institution.  Similarly, the United States has undergone significant transformations, moving from a society that once marginalized African-Americans to one that has elevated them to positions of leadership.  A comparable reversal is on the horizon for the Christian faith, as adherents seek to return to the fundamental sources of their beliefs.  To facilitate this process, a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' teachings will be necessary, one that interprets his words as rich in metaphor and symbolism, rather than taken at face value.  By examining the historical precedents, we can distill the essence of the original faith, tracing its roots back to its earliest manifestations in Judaism.  In the centuries preceding the Roman conquest of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Jewish thought was characterized by a deep commitment to monotheism, the revelatory nature of scripture, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  However, the Jewish community was not monolithic, comprising various factions such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the broader populace.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair offers a scathing critique of human nature, revealing a pervasive tendency towards self-interest and a lack of consideration for others. Sinclair masterfully portrays the corrupting influence of unchecked economic ambition, exemplified by the factory owners and managers who prioritize profit over people and the environment. The author's vivid descriptions of the industrial landscape, such as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\", underscore the devastating consequences of their actions.\n\nThe factory owners and managers display a callous disregard for the welfare of their employees and the surrounding ecosystem. They are willing to sacrifice the health and well-being of their workers in pursuit of economic gain, as Sinclair illustrates through the phrase \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". The absence of labor protections during the time period allowed these individuals to exploit their workers, forcing them to work excessively long hours in hazardous conditions without adequate compensation or support.\n\nThe novel suggests that the workers in Packingtown were effectively trapped in a system that prioritized profit over people. The lack of accessible resources and support mechanisms left them vulnerable to exploitation, with unions often serving only to further enrich themselves at the expense of the workers. Sinclair's description of the working class as a \"population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\" serves as a stark reminder of the dehumanizing effects of unchecked capitalism.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs various literary techniques to elicit a specific emotional response from his readers in The Great Gatsby. Effective use of these techniques varies among authors, and Fitzgerald is no exception. One striking method he employs is juxtaposing seemingly incongruous adjectives with nouns to create a distinct atmosphere. He also skillfully assigns symbolic meanings to objects and later leverages these connotations to convey deeper significance.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs the technique of imbuing colors with meaning, most notably white and gray. These colors are not merely descriptive elements, but serve as potent symbols that evoke a particular sentiment. The meanings attached to these colors are expertly woven throughout the novel, eventually manifesting in the reader's perception of pivotal objects. The dichotomy of white and gray is initially established as a representative of refinement and uniformity, respectively.\n\nThe former connotes an air of elegance and sophistication, while the latter suggests wear and age. This binary is consistently reinforced throughout the novel's commencement. The affluent characters, such as Daisy and Jordan, are frequently associated with white attire, as exemplified by Nick's \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party and Tom's \"white shirt\" during his encounter with Myrtle. Conversely, the presence of gray is often linked to the mundane and the ordinary, like the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nAs the narrative progresses, Fitzgerald skillfully subverts these initial associations, using white and gray to signify the lack of significance or uniformity in certain subjects. This process begins with Daisy, who is initially introduced as a vibrant and dynamic character. However, after a prolonged absence of these colors, her reappearance in a \"little white roadster\" subtly undermines her individuality, reducing her to a uniform and coveted object in Gatsby's eyes. This technique is repeated throughout the novel, as Fitzgerald employs white and gray to convey a sense of uniformity and lack of distinction in various characters and settings.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural sector, driven by its favorable climate and ample sunlight. The region's fertile landscape allows for a diverse range of crops to flourish, including fresh produce such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and an assortment of herbs. Berries, peaches, lemons, and other tree fruits are also cultivated in the area. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations operating lengthy waiting lists for their produce. Organic dairy products, including eggs and milk, are also highly sought after. Furthermore, several local farms offer guided tours, allowing visitors to explore the agricultural processes and enjoy activities like hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor pursuits. This model of sustainable agriculture not only enables landowners to tap into government incentives but also fosters a healthier environment, opening opportunities for recreational use, educational programs, and revenue generation.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming extend beyond economic gains. A notable advantage is the promotion of biodiversity in both plant and animal life, as a result of the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. Conversely, organic farming presents some challenges, including increased labor requirements for pest and weed management, soil fertilization, and the potential for higher losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often lack the efficiency and economies of scale associated with larger operations. Other environmentally beneficial practices, such as cover cropping, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, may also incur higher labor costs. Therefore, a landowner seeking to balance profitability with environmental stewardship may necessitate seeking financial assistance or expert guidance.\n\nThe hypothetical property in question is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the town of Potrero, California. The 160-acre parcel consists of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the land is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and woodcutters in the late 19th century. This specific property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nFor this project, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to identify potential cost-saving measures and strategies for maintaining wildlife-friendly agricultural practices. I drew inspiration from an existing organic farm in the same region as a model for this hypothetical scenario.",
            "The role of cultural nuances in the negotiation process cannot be overstated. Cultural identity is a multifaceted entity that encompasses both what it represents and what it does not. It resists simplistic categorization, defying labels such as \"uniform\" or \"singular.\" The notion that an entire nation or organization can be reduced to a single trait, like \"the stubbornness of Russians\" or \"the accommodating nature of the Japanese,\" is a gross oversimplification. While a general understanding of cultural tendencies can be beneficial, it is more productive to focus on the specific cultural dynamics that will impact the negotiation. By doing so, one can develop a more nuanced appreciation for how cultural attitudes will shape the conversation.\n\nFamiliarizing oneself with a foreign culture or perspective involves a range of approaches, from studying its history and evolution to acknowledging its biases and preconceptions. Rather than attempting to alter or judge a culture, it is essential to accept and work within its boundaries, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where a weaker bargaining position may be at play. When operating in unfamiliar territory, demonstrating respect for local customs and traditions can facilitate smoother communication and help break down cultural barriers.\n\nIt is also worth noting that cultural identity is not solely defined by national or international affiliations. Companies within a given nation can develop their unique corporate cultures, which may prioritize work-life balance, efficiency, or community engagement. These corporate cultures can be reflected in various aspects, such as employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, there is significant diversity in corporate culture, with notable variations between companies and regions. This highlights the importance of examining the complexities within a culture, rather than relying on surface-level generalizations.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying values of a culture is crucial, as they provide the foundation for its behavior and decision-making. For instance, in cultures where saving face or maintaining harmony is valued, a negotiator may be hesitant to publicly criticize their organization or superior. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize a strong work ethic, a negotiator may be more inclined to push for a hard bargain. By considering these cultural subtleties, a negotiator can better navigate the negotiation process and build a more effective relationship with their counterpart. Ultimately, learning about the personal values and perspectives of one's opponent can be invaluable in achieving a successful outcome.",
            "The notion that the absence of a higher authority is a notion that has been entertained by philosophers and theologians across various eras. The biblical passage found in Psalm 14, attributed to the Christian tradition, serves as a foundational text in the philosophical discourse on the existence of God. This idea is also central to the philosophical arguments of Thomas Aquinas, a medieval scholar whose works will be the subject of our examination alongside those of St. Anselm. To facilitate a comparative analysis, we will assume that both thinkers subscribe to a monotheistic worldview, specifically one grounded in the biblical narrative. A more nuanced understanding of their arguments would be compromised by assuming a more abstract or pantheistic notion of the divine. \n\nOur analysis suggests that while both thinkers present compelling arguments, neither provides a definitive basis for believing in the existence of a higher power. To demonstrate this, we will first examine the philosophical framework presented by St. Anselm. Anselm's argument posits that the existence of God can be inferred through introspection and rational inquiry. He contends that the concept of God's nonexistence is inherently self-contradictory, and therefore, can be excluded from consideration. This perspective implies that the evidence for God's existence can be found within the realm of human consciousness, rendering external evidence unnecessary. This perspective is reflective of the Christian emphasis on faith as a foundation for belief.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a more empirically grounded argument for the existence of God. He suggests that reason and evidence can provide a conclusive proof of God's existence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach has significant implications for evangelism and the dissemination of religious ideas, as it allows for the persuasion of new converts through logical reasoning rather than reliance on unverifiable assertions. Aquinas develops five distinct arguments for the existence of God, each of which relies on the logical necessity of a higher power. These arguments include the concepts of change, causality, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, demonstrating that the existence of God can be inferred through the analysis of observable phenomena and logical deduction.",
            "A significant figure, destined to be called the Buddha, emerged in the 5th or 6th century BCE. Over time, he abandoned worldly life and achieved enlightenment, setting in motion a legacy that has endured for approximately 2,500 years. The resultant philosophy, Buddhism, has undergone notable transformations, especially within the Theravada tradition, which is widely regarded as its most authentic expression. The evolution of this ancient faith is exemplified in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony has become an integral part of the cultural landscape. Although this celebration is not directly referenced in the Buddha's teachings, it highlights the divergences between past and present, encompassing everything from superficial customs to the fundamental principles of the faith. As the Theravada community, encompassing both monastic and lay adherents, has navigated the passage of time, its doctrine has adapted to external and internal influences, ranging from hostile and benevolent forces.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, certain key terms will be employed. Internal forces are defined as those emanating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation, while external forces are those originating from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that intentionally or unintentionally harm the Buddhist community, often motivated by negative perceptions of the faith. Conversely, benign forces neither aim to harm nor assist the community, although they may inadvertently have an impact. These definitions will be referenced frequently throughout this analysis.\n\nTo establish a foundation for further exploration, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents take refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the three baskets of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka, which contains the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary guidelines; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which addresses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key concepts within the latter include Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (the impermanence of all phenomena). Recognizing these principles is crucial for transcending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which perpetuates itself continuously. Ultimately, enlightenment will also bring an end to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes rules for lay and monastic adherents, including the five precepts for the laity (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in inappropriate conduct, and I shall not consume intoxicants) and a more extensive set of disciplinary guidelines for monks. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the concept of the four noble truths: Dukkha (the reality of suffering), the causal relationship between attachment and suffering, and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "The complex and often contentious relationship between the United States and Mexico serves as a prime example of a longstanding rivalry between neighboring nations that spanned an impressive 57-year period, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The conflict reached a boiling point during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States emerge victorious and secure significant territorial gains, including Texas and the American Southwest, as a result of its military campaigns against Mexico. However, this was not an isolated incident, as numerous other clashes and disputes took place between the two nations, ultimately subsiding on the eve of World War I.\n\nThis rivalry was rooted in fundamental differences between the two nations, particularly with regards to religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). Similar dynamics can be observed in other nations sharing a common border, where the convergence of interests often leads to the formation of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are not unique in this regard, as David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico, along with Cuba, represent longstanding challenges to American foreign policy (p. 41). Their geographical proximity to the United States and historical rivalries have contributed to the perpetuation of tensions between the two nations, distinguishing them from other Latin American countries that have traditionally enjoyed more amicable relations with the United States.\n\nThe influence of religion played a significant role in fostering this divide, as Sally Frahm (2001) points out that \"in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, whereas in the 20th century, their focus shifted to fascism and communism\" (p. 86). In this context, the ideological struggles between the United States and Mexico were, to a large extent, driven by differing religious preferences. The historical legacy of distrust between the English and Spanish further complicated the establishment of harmonious diplomatic relations between the two nations. As a result, the United States and Mexico inherited a legacy of mutual distrust from their colonial past, which significantly hindered the development of a more cooperative relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) have documented 17 notable disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year period of rivalry. The majority of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge that was eventually addressed through increased military presence on both sides of the border (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States (p. 109) and eventually subsided as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the later part of the 19th century.",
            "It's been fifteen years since my life took an unexpected turn due to a health condition that caught me off guard. At the time, I was in my mid-forties and a nurse, having chosen my profession as a way to secure a stable future. Growing up, I often heard that no matter what, I could always rely on a steady income due to the demands of healthcare. However, my aspirations lay elsewhere - in the worlds of science and journalism, preferably a combination of both. \n\nThe reality hit hard: I was left unable to work, with limited savings and no financial security. To this day, I rely on disability benefits, and I've had to adapt to a life that's uncertain and often challenging. Despite the difficulties, I've come to appreciate the support of my loved ones and a handful of loyal friends. Their assistance has been a lifeline, and I've learned that even the strongest individuals can't navigate every obstacle alone.\n\nLife is unpredictable, and emergencies can arise without warning. No matter how prepared we think we are, there will always be situations that exceed our capacity to cope. I firmly believe that rather than placing all our faith in a single entity, we should focus on rebuilding community and fostering a culture of mutual support. By doing so, we can break down the myth of individualism and rediscover the values that truly made America great: compassion, cooperation, and a willingness to lend a helping hand.\n\nI'm not advocating for a complete reliance on the government. On the contrary, I think we'd be better off if Americans learned to trust and help one another. We should strive to be prepared, just as I have been - with a well-stocked emergency kit, a supply of essential items, and a basic understanding of self-sufficiency. If feasible, having a small garden or a wood stove can be a valuable asset. However, it's equally important to cultivate relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors. By doing so, we can build a stronger, more resilient community that's better equipped to face the unexpected challenges life throws our way.",
            "In exploring the intricacies of evolutionary processes, one cannot help but wonder: what drives organisms to evolve in the manner that they do? Are there underlying constraints that influence the trajectory of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson penned in 1917 that the task of defining organic forms in mathematical terms was a distant dream for zoologists, this challenge remains a pressing concern today. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have seen its application in the field of mollusk skeletogenesis, with notable contributions from researchers such as Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur research delves into the realm of mathematical modeling, combining it with experimental studies to elucidate the mechanisms governing evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. By leveraging X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we have identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters have been input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995), enabling us to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a dynamic structure that traverses 360 degrees of spatial space over time. The successive coils of a shell are known as whorls, which appear to spiral around a central axis, or columella. This axis extends through the shell's central column, separating each whorl from the next by a continuous line, or suture. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, resulting in a complex arrangement of whorls. In most shells, the final whorl is the largest, or body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the base being the opposite end. The aperture serves as the opening through which the animal emerges.\n\nShells can be observed from various vantage points, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, an apertural view is employed, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex oriented upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves initially viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture. A dividing line is then drawn, and whorls are counted from this point, with estimates made to a quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell can be regarded as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture through coordinates representing the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, it is possible to chart the trajectory of the shell's development. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing for the manipulation of parameters and the modification of the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality has encountered a plateau over the past decade, despite notable advancements in other areas, such as water and sanitation, aligning with the country's Millennium Development Goals. However, the sluggish pace of improvement in child and maternal health remains a pressing concern, with a significant gap to bridge before the target goals of 2015 can be achieved. Several critical factors contributing to this stagnation will be examined below, underscoring the necessity of fortifying the healthcare system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in increasing the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% now meeting this benchmark. Notwithstanding this progress, the category still encompasses traditional birth attendants, such as midwives, who may not possess the requisite medical expertise to intervene in complicated pregnancies, thereby perpetuating high rates of maternal mortality due to hemorrhage. Consequently, the improvement in this metric may be misleading, and substantial work remains to be done. Furthermore, a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases among children under five treated by a healthcare professional is also a cause for concern, with incomplete data on postnatal care revealing persistently low rates nationwide.\n\nThe relatively low cesarean-section rate of 4% in Indonesia raises additional concerns, with the urban-rural disparity further exacerbating the issue. While the rate of cesarean sections stands at 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural settings, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services across the country. Moreover, the significant 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles indicates that access to healthcare services is concentrated in urban areas, leaving the poor disproportionately disadvantaged due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can Indonesia most effectively address the dearth of services? Specifically, should the country opt for targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system, prioritizing comprehensive maternal and child care over piecemeal interventions? While programmatic approaches offer the allure of targeted objectives and swift results, they also harbor several drawbacks. For instance, investing heavily in one sector often comes at the expense of other areas, diverting resources and personnel to the more lucrative or high-profile initiatives, as evident in the case of HIV/AIDS and family planning. Moreover, the proliferation of parallel programs within a single sector can lead to duplication of services, inefficient coordination, and increased administrative burdens, including redundant forms, paperwork, and funding requirements.",
            "Victorian fiction is distinguished by its meticulousness and preoccupation with the upper echelons of society.  Two novels that diverge from this convention are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which instead incorporate elements of enigma and peculiarity.  By leveraging these unconventional narrative techniques, the authors create a sense of intrigue that propels the reader deeper into the interior lives of their characters, offering a more nuanced understanding of their motivations and emotional states.\n\nAs Dickens describes in Oliver Twist, the blend of reality and dream-like scenarios serves to heighten the sense of uncertainty and tension.  This is exemplified in the following passage: \"And now, a multitude of bewildering ideas crowded his mind; he seemed to still be walking alongside Sikes and Crackit, who were quarreling: the words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he caught his attention, he found himself in conversation with them... He jerked back at the sound of gunfire; a chorus of cries and shouts filled the air, and lights danced before his eyes. The commotion subsided as suddenly as it began, leaving behind a vague, nagging sense of pain that gnawed at him relentlessly.\"\n\nThe two novels make use of dream sequences or dream-like states to achieve this effect, albeit in distinctly different ways. In Oliver Twist, these disorienting episodes often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, exposing his vulnerabilities and the depth of his emotional pain. When Oliver is forced to relive the shooting in Chapter 28, his vivid recollection is akin to a dream, as he desperately seeks assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's loss of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his physical state, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting event overwhelms him, rendering him numb and disconnected from his surroundings; his despair is re-experienced, now infused with a sense of fear rather than shock. This sequence raises questions about the agency behind Oliver's misfortune, implying that it was not his own doing. Furthermore, it suggests that Oliver's growing sense of hopelessness is a testament to Fagin's influence, which has eroded his ability to react or take control of his fate.\n\nIn a subsequent passage from Wuthering Heights, the author writes: \"The day passed – it was more like night; the day was gone as soon as it began – and night fell once more; a long, oppressive silence, punctuated by fleeting moments.\"",
            "I worked in an after-school program about two years ago, where I provided academic support to elementary school students. My expertise lay in English and reading, but I was eager to assist students struggling in various subjects. One student, Adrian, was particularly memorable. He was a third or fourth grader who faced reading challenges. What struck me was the inconsistency in his reading abilities – he would accurately pronounce some letters but struggle with others. His proficiency in spoken English was impressive, but his reading difficulties were unrelated to language comprehension. His mother, whose native language was Spanish, communicated with me through limited Spanish, which I struggled to understand. The revelation that dawned on me was that Adrian's reading difficulties stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet.\n\nThis experience resonates with the broader issue of language barriers in education, particularly in California. It highlights that even fluent English speakers can struggle with reading, and assumptions about a student's language proficiency may be misleading. The solution for Adrian was straightforward: targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the issue is more complex. There is no single solution, and a combination of approaches is necessary.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising approach for students whose first language is not English. Research has shown that students in bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Critics argue that it's resource-intensive and may not benefit all students, but this is not necessarily true. Implementing dual language programs as the norm, rather than the exception, would benefit all students. To make this feasible, we could introduce bilingual support staff, rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual. This could include tutors, aides, or other educational assistants who can provide targeted support to students with language barriers.",
            "The notion of a transcendent force greater than ourselves is ingrained in us from an early age, often through the teachings of our caregivers or the pursuit of self-discovery. Some people adhere to established spiritual frameworks, while others reject these concepts outright, convinced that our individual experiences encompass the entirety of existence. Our perception of spirituality is a dynamic, evolving process, as we navigate various value systems and philosophies in search of meaning. The desire for illumination in the darkness drives us forward, illuminating our path and casting aside the shadows.\n\nAs I sat with my father on our porch, the sound of rain pattering against the tin roof created a somber atmosphere. The gutters, overflowing with water, drowned the plants that lined the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of introspection and reminiscence. His physical appearance had changed – his frame had grown thinner, his clothes hung loosely on his body, and his hair had begun to recede. I felt a sense of isolation and trepidation, but couldn't bring myself to discuss my concerns about his deteriorating health, as acknowledging them would only make the reality more unbearable for both of us.\n\nWe sat together in silence, the only sound the raindrops hitting the roof. I inched my chair closer to his, and together we gazed out into the twilight, the rain creating a soothing melody. My father passed away that December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the projected timeline, but at what cost, I couldn't rationalize. In the stillness of the night, I found myself questioning the existence of a higher power, wondering if it had ever truly listened to my pleas.\n\nI didn't attend his passing, unable to bear watching the life that shaped me slip away. Instead, I chose to remember my father through his accomplishments and the time we shared, rather than the circumstances of his departure. I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. For three days, I remained in a state of emotional numbness, awaiting the news that would forever alter my life.\n\nThe phone remained silent, a stark reminder of the emptiness that had descended upon me.",
            "The label 'Gothic Novel' is a paradoxical term that encapsulates both the timeless and the novel, a dichotomy first noted by Ian Watt in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has been subject to various interpretations, ranging from criticism to praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth, while others see it as an exemplar of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The foundational 'Gothic Novel', Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the legacies of both ancient and modern romance to forge a new literary path. By merging venerable theatrical elements with the modern novel's capacity for introspection, Walpole created a unique blend, which he termed a 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently incorporates references to medieval theatricality, architecture, and cultural heritage. Even at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term 'gothic' was applied to a wide range of contexts, often carrying connotations of antiquity or unsophistication in comparison to the progress of modern society and literature. The fusion of the theatrical and the novelistic, with their respective emphasis on spectacle and psychological insight, has allowed the Gothic genre to endure, achieving a paradoxical state of obsolescence and renewal for readers separated from its original context.\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of the Gothic novel is its engagement with the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, as a code of conduct for knights, is reinterpreted and reimagined in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds a particular significance for Gothic writers, who saw it as a symbol of the noble knight, exemplifying virtues such as bravery, honor, and competence. However, they also perceived a decline from this ideal in their contemporary society, which led them to idealize and romanticize the 'gothic past' (hinting at the eventual evolution of Gothic into Romanticism). In Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, this nostalgia for a lost era is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits and is described as:\n\nFrederic's characterization is noteworthy for its traditional associations with the chivalric ideal. As a prince, he has experienced suffering, been marked by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the 'gallant and courteous knight' is, of course, an exaggeration, which serves to introduce the Gothic trope of excess (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management encompasses the intricate network of processes that facilitate the movement of goods from raw materials to customers. This complex system was first conceptualized in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a renowned consultant. Oliver's work underscored the importance of orchestrating the various stages of supply chain management, from procurement to distribution, to satisfy customer needs in an efficient and timely manner. Six pivotal elements comprise the supply chain framework: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Skilled managers adeptly utilize these components to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundational stage of the supply chain, laying the groundwork for the entire process. It involves determining the optimal production strategy, encompassing factors such as when, where, and how goods will be manufactured. Managers must conduct market research to gauge customer demand, which serves as a critical determinant in informing production decisions. By analyzing market trends and customer preferences, managers can determine the products to be manufactured, their quantities, and the most suitable production locations, taking into account factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction.\n\nIn a well-structured supply chain, production planning is closely intertwined with scheduling and maintenance. Managers must meticulously coordinate workloads and maintenance tasks to ensure seamless operations. The slightest misstep can lead to substantial time and financial losses in the long run. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have implemented comprehensive design guidelines, inclusive of detailed protocols for uniform design, receiving shipments, and other operational aspects. This structured approach enables smooth execution and minimizes confusion among employees.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each equipped with distinct equipment, personnel, and specialized skills. Managers must select the most suitable division for each process and consider outsourcing work to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to provide high-quality products while maintaining cost-effectiveness.",
            "A shocking claim is emblazoned on a makeshift sign, held aloft by the actress Ellen Page on a city street. The stark message, scrawled in bold letters, appears to suggest that a certain historical figure is alive and residing in a country shrouded in controversy. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been under the iron-fisted rule of a military junta since 1962, following a coup that seized power from its democratically elected government. In 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, led by a large contingent of Buddhist monks. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these demonstrations drew international attention, with the monks seeking greater freedoms and an end to the military's grip on power. However, the government's response was swift and brutal, with reports of violence and human rights abuses mounting. Foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who ultimately lost his life, were targeted by the authorities, while the official death toll was significantly lower than the estimates of those on the ground. According to Colonel Hla Win, a former military officer who defected to the opposition, the true extent of the violence was far more severe, with thousands of civilians killed.\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. The desire for absolute control and the suppression of dissent has been a hallmark of authoritarian regimes throughout history. From ancient Rome, where emperors claimed divine right to rule, to Japan, where the emperor is still revered as a deity, the pattern of oppression has been a constant. In more recent times, the world has witnessed numerous examples of governments cracking down on their citizens. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals clashed with the government, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias and government forces targeted Tutsis and moderates, are just two instances of the devastating consequences of unchecked power. The atrocities committed during the Holocaust, a period of genocide orchestrated by the Nazi regime, also serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed, in large part, to his remarkable longevity and his unparalleled ability to shape the sound of his orchestra. While often taking a discreet role on the piano, Ellington proved himself a master composer who skillfully highlighted the individual talents of his band members. By crafting a rich and intricate framework for improvisation, Ellington's compositions seamlessly integrated soloists and ensembles, yielding works of great musicality and coherence. His expertise in recognizing the unique timbres of each player, as well as their interaction within the ensemble, enabled him to create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nA testament to Ellington's innovative approach is evident in his use of voice as a melodic instrument, as exemplified by Creole Love Call. This early piece showcases his ability to liberate the voice from the constraints of lyrics, incorporating it as a distinct timbre and texture. Notably, this slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues work features six distinct choruses, each showcasing a different facet of Ellington's compositional talent.\n\nChorus 1 establishes a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic tone before shifting to a more rugged, emotive quality. Chorus 2 features a muted trumpet solo, elaborating on the basic melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. Chorus 3 showcases a soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band reprise the first chorus, with the brass and reed sections engaging in a call-and-response dialogue. Chorus 5 is the climactic peak of the piece, with the reeds initiating the call-and-response in a high register, while the brass and rhythm sections contribute a syncopated, stop-time rhythm. Chorus 6 returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting a growling, instrumental timbre.\n\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag, featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, novelty ending by a trombone. Ellington's use of voice as a means of adding tonal color is a hallmark of his compositional style, evident throughout his body of work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his acute sensitivity to timbre. The piece features a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, seamlessly integrating the vocal aspects of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further exemplifying his ability to bring out the unique qualities of each player.",
            "She felt a persistent void within herself, an unfulfilled longing that had persisted since adolescence. The sensation had begun to nag at her when she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of her teenage years. Now, at 17, the ache remained, albeit with a subtle shift in focus. She yearned for human connection, rather than mere objects or superficial experiences. However, her disinterest in the boys who showed interest in her had left her bewildered, prompting her to introspect on the underlying reasons for this anomaly. \n\nAs she pondered her desires, she led a relatively peaceful life at home, surrounded by parents who exuded calm and tranquility. They rarely argued, and when they did, it was usually about her pursuit of independence and self-expression. This dichotomy created an intriguing dynamic, as her lively personality and kind nature endeared her to those around her.\n\nOn this particular day, though, the atmosphere was far from serene. As she moved through the house, searching for inspiration, she was startled by the unmistakable sound of her mother's distress call from the kitchen. The urgency in her voice sent her daughter rushing to her side, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" The mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain, and repeatedly whispered, \"Ow.\" The girl sprang into action, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder and asking, \"Aunt, what's wrong?\" Her mother managed to urge her on, her words laced with pain and urgency, \"T-take me to the hospital.\" The daughter swiftly obliged, carefully lifting her mother and guiding her to the car. She had been fortunate to have taken those self-defense classes, which allowed her to support her mother effortlessly.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and the anxiety-filled atmosphere were unmistakable, but her daughter's focus remained fixed on her mother's well-being. She briskly entered the emergency room, calling out for medical assistance, and soon a team of concerned faces gathered around. A rolling bed was brought in, and her mother was quickly assessed by the doctors. The daughter was left to anxiously wait, her eyes fixed on the medical team as they worked to assess and treat her mother's injury.\n\nIt was later revealed that her mother had suffered a fall from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "A comprehensive research endeavor aimed to investigate the correlation between adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (Med diet) and the incidence of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke-related mortality. The study employed a modified version of the Med diet, known as the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, which incorporates increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant-based proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption was permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a negative association between adherence to the Med diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. A notable intervention study revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, prior research did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation involved a sample of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the aMed diet score using self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. Notably, more than 95% of the participants maintained their involvement throughout the study period. The FFQs were subject to validation studies to ensure accuracy.\n\nIncident cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions. Covariates, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, were calculated for each FFQ. Additionally, leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from multiple FFQs were calculated. Adjustments were made for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nA Cox proportional-hazard model was employed to examine the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe findings revealed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. Notably, women in the top aMed quintile demonstrated a reduced risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The financial landscape of the United States underwent a significant downturn in 2007, as unemployment rates rose and the housing market teetered on the brink of collapse. Several prominent corporations found themselves on the precipice of insolvency, prompting a critical examination of the factors that contributed to this crisis. It is essential to investigate the root causes of this calamity and explore potential avenues for mitigation. A cursory analysis suggests that a combination of reckless and shortsighted policy decisions ultimately led to the widespread issuance of sub-prime loans within an underdeveloped financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were incentivized to purchase and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, which ultimately proved to be a recipe for disaster.\n\nA critical examination of historical data reveals that the seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration. In an effort to boost his popularity and secure a second term, the President relaxed lending regulations, creating a fertile ground for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. A prescient article by Steven Holmes, published in the New York Times in 1999, warned of the consequences of such actions: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's leading underwriter of home mortgages, has come under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also facing pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes' insightful commentary was a harbinger of the impending economic downturn, which would ultimately precipitate a government-led bailout reminiscent of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nSeveral interrelated factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the proliferation of novel and complex mortgage products such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments served to entwine various sectors of the economy with the housing market, rendering households and financial institutions perilously exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. As the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities found themselves reeling from the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported an astonishing $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The fallout from this crisis was severe: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at rock-bottom prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to undergo a dramatic transformation, subjecting themselves to intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, found themselves burdened with an staggering $5 trillion in mortgage debt, prompting their government-led takeover in September 2008.",
            "The art of exposition - that treacherous stretch of narrative where even the most skilled writers risk losing their audience.  It's the section where the goal is to engage, to enthrall, yet all too often, the opposite occurs: readers disengage, hitting the back button or succumbing to torpor. Dr. Emma Jenkins' reaction to such passages is not unlike that of a pilot confronted with a sudden turbulence - she finds herself shouting at her monitor, frustration and annoyance mingling on her face.\n\nExposition is an obstacle many writers face.  Even those familiar with the fundamental \"Show, don't tell\" principle can find themselves sliding into lengthy descriptions of events that fail to propel the story forward.  It's the insidious voice within, urging the author to introduce background information, often in the guise of efficiency, only to bog down the narrative in the process.\n\nIn film, exposition can manifest as a character's lengthy monologue, reminiscent of Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, it's the author's attempt to convey crucial details through direct telling.  A telling example comes to mind: a heroine's backstory, detailing her meeting with a charming partner, their wedding, and the tragic loss of that partner.  Typically, this sequence would unfold over several pages, but with sparse dialogue and underdeveloped characters.  However, a more engaging approach would delve deeper into the husband's character, revealing his love for the heroine through his words and actions.  Similarly, the heroine's transformation, sparked by her relationship, would be skillfully woven into the narrative.  The reader would develop an emotional connection with the characters, investing in their experiences and relationships.  This would make the eventual loss more impactful, fostering a deeper understanding of the heroine's psyche.\n\nIn essence, the storyline \"They met, they married, he died\" needs fleshing out.  As a writer, it's essential to resist the urge to gloss over pivotal moments.  Consider the character of a former Air Force pilot, now managing a gas station by night, with a complicated past and secret aspirations.  A single line about his background may be tempting, but it's the subtleties - his mannerisms, speech patterns, and desires - that bring him to life, making him a believable and relatable figure.  The key is to provide depth, not just brevity.",
            "I viewed a pair of newscasts originating from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The initial broadcast, which aired live on NBC 4, reported on a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. A male individual, identified as Shad Hostettler, was taken into custody following an alleged attack on his wife. Despite the gravity of the situation, the story was only allotted two minutes, likely due to its developing nature. While the details were limited, it was stated that the attack involved multiple stab wounds.\n\nThe subsequent report focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which left an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers, critically injured. No arrests had been made, and the SWAT Team was actively investigating the case. A notable aspect of this story was its brevity, which may have been influenced by various factors, including the socio-economic context of the neighborhood.\n\nAnother story highlighted the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators suspected a .22 caliber bullet, likely fired from a rifle, as the cause of the damage. A reward of $5,000 was announced for information leading to the apprehension of the perpetrator.\n\nThe weather forecast for the upcoming weekend predicted thunderstorms and rain, with temperatures ranging from the mid to low eighties. The segment was brief, possibly to pique viewers' interest in tuning in for further updates.\n\nA story about a robbery at a Clime Road convenience store in Columbus also aired. The suspect, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie, had allegedly targeted the store. The news anchor devoted significant time to emphasizing the suspect's racial characteristics, which may have been excessive given the circumstances.\n\nFinally, a report was aired about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation spanning from Texas to Ohio. The defendant had been sentenced to 300 months in prison, a sentence that was phrased in a manner that may have been intended to convey a sense of severity. Notably, the anchor highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, although this detail seemed peripheral to the story.",
            "A deep and intricate connection exists between brothers, forged from an intricate tapestry of emotions. This bond encompasses a broad spectrum of feelings, including love, pride, resentment, and even a hint of malice. Brothers possess a unique understanding of one another, one that transcends their relationships with others. When gazing into the eyes of a sibling, they catch a glimpse of their own reflection, stripped of external influences. This profound insight is often revealed in the most trying of circumstances, showcasing the complexities of their bond. As these emotions unfold, they carry significant consequences, and it is through navigating these repercussions that one comes to grasp the essence of fraternal ties.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, weaving it throughout a rich, vivid narrative. Against the backdrop of a lush, evocative landscape, two brothers embark on a perilous journey, marked by bitter disappointment and intense pride. Ultimately, only one brother escapes unscathed. The author skillfully conveys the complexities of their bond through the protagonist's character development and interactions with his sibling, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective. This narrative voice effectively communicates the intricate emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him, which greatly influences his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, his relationship with his younger brother, Doodle, is characterized by a sense of disillusionment. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could share in his adventures, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's fragile health renders these aspirations unattainable, leaving the protagonist's dreams shattered. The disparity between his expectations and reality sparks a mix of emotions within him, including a fleeting desire to abandon his brother. Yet, even this dark impulse is tempered by the child's simple, radiant smile, which reawakens a deep and enduring love for his sibling. This paradox highlights the complexity of the protagonist's feelings, revealing a duality of emotions that underscores the true nature of their bond.",
            "The human brain is a complex, dynamic system of information processing that has evolved in tandem with advancements in technology. The metaphors employed to describe this system have also undergone significant revisions, progressing from analogies rooted in ancient writing materials like wax tablets and papyrus to more contemporary comparisons with modern computing devices. While these analogies offer a useful framework for comprehension, it is essential to recognize their limitations, which can lead to misinterpretation. \n\nThe process of information processing begins with the conversion of physical stimuli from sensory organs, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. These sensory inputs are then repeatedly transformed through a hierarchical process, involving both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box against a white background, the system initially assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries – where the color changes significantly over a short distance – to form a representation of a box. Subsequently, top-down processing leverages prior decisions to expedite the recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped void.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain level, a regulatory mechanism determines its priority and allocates it to specific cognitive processes. For example, although the brain processes every blade of grass when gazing at one's shoes, a healthy regulatory mechanism prevents individual blades from being consciously perceived. Conversely, one might readily identify their name in a noisy environment. This hierarchical process of information processing involves multiple stages, with the regulatory mechanism modulating the flow of information at every step.\n\nIn order for information to be processed, it must first be stored in the brain. There are various types of memory, each with distinct characteristics, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with encoding techniques varying depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural, phonetic, or semantic properties. Following encoding, information is maintained through various mechanisms. Some research suggests that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a specific sequence of neurons for a brief period. In contrast, long-term memory is thought to be preserved through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nSeveral theoretical models have been proposed to explain the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing from diverse disciplines such as psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, the node \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be connected to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel Brave New World, the author critiques the looming threats of technological advancement and the capitalist framework that supports it. The society, where collective happiness is prioritized over individuality, is conditioned from an early age to pursue fleeting pleasure above all else. The inhabitants, it appears, are mere pawns in a grand game controlled by the World Controller, forced to conform to a singular ideology. By examining the work through the lens of Marxist theory, one can discern Huxley's underlying concerns regarding the emergence of these societal systems.\n\nThe novel employs Marxist concepts to satirize capitalism, utilizing the notion of false consciousness to illustrate how the common citizenry is prevented from understanding their true relationships with other economic classes. This is achieved through ideological control, as seen in the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which instills a desire for consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this drive, ensuring the lower classes remain oblivious to their exploitation. The concept of hegemony, which describes the domination of social groups by a separate class, is exemplified in Brave New World, where the lower classes are unaware of their manipulation and the upper classes either accept their station or remain passive.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in the novel are superficial, lacking depth and distinction, which may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and emotional expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance, as seen in the characters' comments about one another. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class within the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority so long as they conform and continue to consume.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years now, which translates to about four and a half semesters. For many, myself included, navigating the campus can be quite a challenge. During my freshman year, I was housed in East Halls dorm, situated at the farthest eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building, located near the center of campus, often took up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. A conversation with an alumnus closer to my age revealed that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been repurposed with the addition of sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, moving from one place to another is becoming increasingly complicated. In a college setting, one possible solution to this issue is the bicycle. Nevertheless, having a bike is merely half the solution; students need to utilize it regularly, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a several-year hiatus sparked some interesting insights. He remarked, \"Cycling is an excellent option; for a few years, it wasn't seen as fashionable to ride a bike, but it's the most practical way to get around.\" In addition to the physical benefits, cycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. With a nutritious meal and moderate physical exertion, you can cover distances of over 30 miles. As someone who now resides off-campus, I'm situated at a similar distance from the campus center as some dorms. The most sensible decision I made this year was purchasing a bike. Daily classes at Thomas building, roughly a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reached in just 5 minutes by bike if I pedal at a moderate pace. My main concern is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, can be a challenging road to navigate, regardless of whether I'm on a bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, I find myself too time-pressed to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation to class, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. Considering all the other time I'd spend walking to and from classes, appointments, and other activities, that's a significant chunk of time I could ill afford to devote."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue my academic and professional ambitions in social work, I am drawn to the field's potential for personal and professional growth, particularly within the realm of the Division of Family and Children Services. My objective is to create a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, as well as to provide support to families experiencing turmoil. My core values, which are deeply ingrained in my personal and professional philosophy, include a commitment to service, respect, and a steadfast dedication to upholding the highest standards of ethics. These values are not merely professional ideals; they are an integral part of my personal identity and inform my approach to building meaningful relationships with others and continually refining my professional skills to remain effective in my field.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have been driven by a strong desire to make a difference in the lives of others. However, I struggled to identify a clear career path that aligned with my passions. As I transitioned from high school to college, I witnessed firsthand the ways in which individuals often cope with adversity in less-than-ideal ways. This experience, combined with my academic foundation in psychology, led me to take a deliberate break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. It was during this time that I had a profound encounter with a young individual who was struggling with the aftermath of abuse. This experience not only deepened my understanding of the complexities of social issues but also instilled in me a sense of purpose and direction. I began to seriously consider a career in social work as a means of addressing the needs of vulnerable populations.\n\nOne of the key principles that underpins social work is the pursuit of social justice. In our society, we often prioritize the notion of individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms and expectations. I believe that this dichotomy is a pressing issue that warrants attention. As someone who values uniqueness and self-expression, I have consistently challenged societal norms throughout my academic and personal life. Whether through artistic expression, activism, or community engagement, I have consistently advocated for social justice and equality. My experiences have taught me the importance of staying true to one's values and principles, even in the face of adversity. I am committed to continuing this work in my future career as a social worker.",
            "This paper presents an examination of the biological and sociocultural frameworks that underpin insomnia, a complex sleep disorder. The biological model focuses on the interplay between genetic inheritance and physiological factors, while the sociocultural model explores the impact of environmental influences, including demographic, socio-economic, and ethnic factors. This review will delve into the research underlying these models, analyzing the strengths and limitations of each study and its relevance to our understanding of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a secondary sleep disorder related to a mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias encompassing insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, and other conditions not specified. Insomnia is characterized by persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias involve behavioral and physiological anomalies, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and other conditions not specified.\n\nThis analysis will focus on the biological model, which posits that sleep disorders are influenced by genetic and physiological factors. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A recent study on mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons is essential for modulating sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of the receptor reduces anxiety and induces sleep. Furthermore, administration of the GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that this receptor plays a critical role in sleep regulation. These findings imply that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of sleep disorders in humans. The sociocultural implications of this research are significant, as the inheritance of a phenotype affecting the GABAB receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, with far-reaching consequences for daily life, including academic and professional performance.",
            "The complexities of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) encompass a multifaceted spectrum of auditory processing difficulties. This paper will delve into three key areas of CAPD: its definition, diagnosis, and the role of educators in supporting students with this condition within mainstreamed classrooms.\n\nAt its core, CAPD revolves around how the central nervous system processes auditory information, which is a critical aspect of our ability to interpret and understand the world around us (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, CAPD specifically refers to the brain's ability to decipher auditory signals, which is essential for distinguishing speech from background noise and recognizing patterns within sound (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). While individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing, their brains struggle to allocate and prioritize auditory input, resulting in difficulties with auditory processing.\n\nHistorically, researchers have made significant strides in understanding CAPD. The concept dates back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first identified \"auditory imperception\" as a critical aspect of communicative disorders (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Notably, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered standardized testing for children with CAPD in the early 1950s, while Kimura's groundbreaking work on dichotic testing in 1961 shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying auditory perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A pivotal conference in 1977 further galvanized research into CAPD in children.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD exhibit a range of processing challenges, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple auditory events, recognizing patterns, and differentiating tone and pitch (Ferre). They may also struggle to differentiate between competing sounds, synthesize sound cues, and understand the sequence of auditory information (Ferre). These challenges can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty identifying sarcasm or detecting changes in speech.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a comprehensive assessment, which may involve systematic observation, questionnaires, and performance on standardized tests (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a variety of tools to evaluate auditory function, including tests that present multiple stimuli and require the patient to differentiate specific items (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). While there is no single, widely accepted diagnostic tool or known cause for CAPD, researchers continue to refine their understanding of this complex condition through ongoing research and testing.",
            "Deception may be an effective tool for achieving short-term goals, but it can also lead to long-term consequences. In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the character's reliance on disguise ultimately forces them to confront the tension between self-preservation and relationships with others. The process of shedding a false identity can be complicated by the risk of alienation, as those who have been deceived may not take kindly to the revelation. This dichotomy is particularly pronounced in situations where deception involves a reversal of gender roles.\n\nOne of the most vexing aspects of this phenomenon is the underlying motivation behind the adoption of a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to pose as a man is driven by a desire for self-protection in an unfamiliar environment. As she navigates her new circumstances, Viola's disguise allows her to establish a sense of control, but it also creates a sense of disconnection from her female peers. This isolation is further complicated by the mistaken assumption of Olivia, who falls in love with the object of her affection under the assumption that he is a man. Meanwhile, Viola must also contend with the unrequited romantic feelings she develops for Orsino.\n\nOn one level, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on the power of deception to uncover suppressed emotions. The characters' responses to Viola/Cesario's presence suggest that they are forced to confront their own desires and biases. For instance, Olivia's shifting affections from Cesario to Sebastian raise questions about the nature of her attraction to the character. Is she drawn to Cesario's male persona, or does she harbor feelings for women? While it is unlikely that Shakespeare intended to portray Olivia as a closeted individual, her character can be seen as a satirical representation of the societal norms of the time, which often judged people based on surface-level appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by Olivia's ease in transitioning from romantic interest to familial affection for Viola, highlighting the fluidity of her character's emotions and her tendency to prioritize social appearances over genuine connections.",
            "The German colonial regime has been characterized by a complex and often brutal nature, as exemplified by the devastating treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, it is essential to acknowledge that no colonial empire can be reduced to a single descriptor, as the German colonial administration exhibited varying policies and approaches across its territories. Similarly, educational initiatives in the colonies were diverse, ranging from established state schools to missionary-led institutions. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of African residents with a high level of literacy and education.\n\nIn contrast, German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a starkly different picture. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively promoted education through state-run institutions, the responsibility for educating the native population in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary organizations that received limited government support. The administration did, however, invest considerable resources in European education, establishing a network of state schools and providing significant backing for missionary-led institutions. These educational policies had long-lasting effects on South West Africa's development, even after the end of German rule. Unfortunately, the outcomes were far from uniform, with the majority of the population in South West Africa remaining largely uneducated and illiterate. Various socio-economic and political factors contributed to this disparate experience, and this paper aims to further explore these factors by examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial officials towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, with a significant portion written in German and published in the early 20th century. These early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in place within the colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and delving deeper into specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems between colonies. Cohen's comprehensive study of education in South West Africa and East Africa provides valuable insights into the divergent educational approaches employed in these regions. Cohen attributes many of the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to the presence of a substantial settler population.\n\nGeographical conditions in South West Africa were relatively favorable, with a moderately temperate climate and arid desert regions. The European population of the territory reflected this relatively hospitable environment, with around 15,000 settlers residing in South West Africa by 1913, in contrast to the approximately 5,336 settlers in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has resulted in a rich tapestry of diverse genres, each with its own unique characteristics and sub-genres. Heavy metal, a genre that has emerged over the past 40 years, stands out for its remarkable adaptability and emotional depth. By embracing its darker aspects, metal has carved out a distinct niche for itself within the music landscape. This trajectory is a testament to the genre's ability to evolve and incorporate elements from other styles, resulting in a diverse array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nThe heavy metal movement has become increasingly complex, with numerous sub-niches and influences from various genres. To fully appreciate the breadth of metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the factors that have shaped its development. At its core, metal is a genre characterized by its intensity, often manifesting as a \"music of excess\" - louder, faster, and more complex than its predecessors. Skilled musicianship is a defining feature of metal, with many artists pushing the boundaries of technical proficiency.\n\nThe genre's association with substance use is also a notable aspect of its history. The mid-1970s saw a surge in psychedelic drug use, which influenced the creation of some of the most innovative and experimental metal records. This period's emphasis on darker, more visceral qualities resonated with listeners who were seeking a more authentic expression of the human experience. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on intense emotions and brooding introspection, further enriching the genre's sonic landscape. The following lyrics from Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the earliest heavy metal tracks, illustrate the genre's affinity for exploring the darker aspects of the human experience:\n\nThis thought-provoking song, penned by the Beatles, showcases the band's ability to craft a heavy, emotive sound that resonated with the times. Released on the iconic White Album, Helter Skelter was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier offerings, demonstrating the Beatles' desire to push the boundaries of their music and assert their own unique style.",
            "In the years preceding the Surrealist movement, a lesser-known figure, Henri Rousseau, was striving for artistic expression that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only captures the wonder of a woman immersed in a dreamlike world but also embodies Rousseau's own personal aspirations and internal conflicts. Having long coveted recognition from his peers and the art world, Rousseau found himself caught between the desire to conform to established styles and the longing to forge his own unique path. This dichotomy is poignantly reflected in The Dream, a work that encapsulates the artist's lifelong struggle to reconcile the need for validation with the urge to innovate.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream in this context, it is essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born in 1844 in the French town of Laval, he hailed from a family of modest means, with his father working as a successful merchant. Despite the absence of formal artistic training, Rousseau's life took a dramatic turn when he lost his young wife and several children, leaving him with a deep sense of sorrow and a yearning for a fresh start. Painting became his solace and a means to reinvent himself. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasantry, Rousseau's work is characterized by a more grounded, folkloric sensibility, reflecting the hopes and aspirations of the common man.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance by the art world is understandable, given his late start in life and the presence of more established artists, including Henri Matisse, who was gaining recognition during the same period. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while both artists operated in the same sphere, their motivations and styles diverged significantly. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to create works that were conventionally appealing, hoping to be acknowledged by the Artiste Français.",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has long fascinated scholars, who often cite a deep-seated connection between truth and beauty. This notion is not merely a product of philosophical speculation, but rather a profound observation grounded in human experience. As John Keats astutely noted in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our understanding of the world is shaped by education and experience, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics often defies conventional instruction. Both endeavors seek to describe, rather than prescribe, and our studies of morality and beauty aim to elucidate the underlying reasons behind the beauty of a piece of art or literature, or the moral implications of an action.\n\nOne notable aspect of this connection is the inherent difficulty in capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful through critical analysis. When evaluating a work of art, such as da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may focus on elements like composition, context, and cultural significance, but these factors ultimately fall short of explaining why the piece is considered great. Instead, our descriptions of art and literature often begin with a vague yet intuitive sense of recognition, as in the phrase, \"There's just something about it.\" This \"something\" is precisely what eludes complete description, and it is this transcendent quality that underlies the power of art and morality.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's observation that a story can convey something that cannot be expressed in other ways reinforces this notion. Similarly, Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be fully expressed and is instead transcendental underscores its elusive nature. This je ne sais quoi, this intangible yet essential quality, is the common thread that weaves ethics and aesthetics together.\n\nThe intersection of ethics and aesthetics is further complicated by the fact that both impact us on a fundamental, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. Our experiences of beauty and morality are ineffable, existing beyond the realm of rational explanation. This connection is particularly pronounced in literature, which, as McKean notes, is distinguished by its unique moral quality. Literature's ability to convey values and inspire reflection makes it a vital part of our shared human experience.",
            "Germany, a nation boasting a distinct cultural identity, is a testament to the rich tapestry of influences that have woven together its history. The country's unique blend of traditions can be observed in various cities, from the southwestern town of Munich nestled at the foot of the Alps to the northern port city of Kiel, situated on the Baltic Sea. Similarly, the Rhine River city of Cologne and the Saxon city of Dresden, located on the Elbe River, both reflect this cultural diversity.\n\nGermany's complex heritage stems from its diverse origins, shaped by various tribes and influences. The term \"Germania\" refers to the ancestral homeland of the German people. The etymology of this name is a subject of ongoing debate among scholars, with multiple theories emerging.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, the name \"Germania\" may have originated from the Tungrian tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus in his work \"Germania\" written in 98 AD. Another theory suggests that Julius Caesar derived the term from the Gauls, using it to distinguish between conquered and unconquered territories in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War). Caesar noted in the first book of his work, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus further elaborated on the origins of the Germans in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (On the Origin and Situation of the Germans), written around 98 AD. He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external migrations or intermarriage. The Romans, Tacitus wrote, would not have voluntarily emigrated to Germany due to its harsh climate, geography, and unyielding culture.\n\nDuring the 1st century AD, Germanic tribes began to interact with the Roman Empire, primarily through trade and military service. They would often trade goods obtained from their homeland and offer their battle-hardened skills to the Roman army in exchange for stable opportunities within the Roman Empire. This initial contact laid the groundwork for a complex and dynamic relationship between the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire, which would eventually shape the course of European history.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind was a blank slate, absorbing the scene before me without attachment. My thoughts flowed in and out with the pace of a gentle stream, never lingering long enough to form a cohesive idea. My mind functioned with a smooth efficiency, allowing me to experience the world around me without the burden of personal interpretation. \n\nIt was during this period that I came across a book, 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,' which offered a unique perspective on the creative process. I had long been fascinated by art, a fascination that began when I was a young child. The book provided a comprehensive guide to understanding art, from the basic tools to the cognitive processes that underlie our perception of visual information. One technique that resonated with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying complex compositions and allowing for a more nuanced understanding of form and structure. \n\nAs I stood before my subject, however, I found myself unable to apply this technique. The scene before me was overwhelming, and I felt a sense of awe wash over me. I thought of the great masters – Picasso's blue period, Monet's affinity for greenery, the Renaissance masters' use of color – and I felt a sense of trepidation. Could I, on my own, create something worthy of the title 'artistic'? \n\nWith a deep breath, I reached for my tool of choice and began to create. My hand moved with a subtle intensity, my muscles flexing as I brought my vision to life. Water flowed, serene and calm. My hand clenched and released, the motion growing more urgent with each passing moment. My hand struck the handle of the toilet, but the stubborn mass refused to budge. \n\nI stood there, mop in hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie knotted uncomfortably around my neck. I surveyed the scene before me, a mess of processed matter left behind by someone else. The air was heavy with the stench of neglect. I stood there, lost in thought, as I pondered the nature of my surroundings. \n\nIt was then that I decided to take action. With a deep breath, I gripped the end of the toilet paper roll and began to twist it into a makeshift mitten. I stood up straight, then bent at the waist, my hand dipping slowly into the bowl with the deliberation of a chef preparing a meal. The motion was almost meditative, a moment of calm in the midst of chaos.",
            "A disturbing trend is unfolding on American roads: the alarming number of teenage fatalities attributed to vehicular accidents. Several key factors contribute to this epidemic, and research from the National Institutes of Health sheds light on the brain's unpreparedness for the risks associated with driving. Moreover, inexperience plays a significant role, leading to higher rates of accidents, rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents. Studies have shown that when teenagers drive with their peers, the risks escalate, as exemplified by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the number of hours teens can drive and prohibit minor passengers. However, these measures, in my opinion, serve only as temporary solutions. The underlying issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are disproportionately vulnerable to the perils of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that a significant proportion of individuals under the age of 19-20 exhibit a predilection for risk-taking due to thrill-seeking tendencies. This finding underscores the need to delay licensing until such tendencies have begun to subside.\n\nConsidering this information, it is reasonable to reevaluate the current licensing system. One potential approach involves increasing the minimum age for obtaining a standard driver's license to 18 or older. This could be achieved by providing driver's education classes in schools and maintaining provisional permits prior to full licensure. A uniform national standard could be established, based on existing state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. By adopting a uniform national policy, we can reduce the staggering number of teen driver fatalities and ensure a safer driving environment across the country.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking concept; rather, it is a sensible solution grounded in empirical evidence and research. By taking a proactive approach to addressing this issue, we can safeguard the lives of countless teenagers and prevent what could be a catastrophic increase in traffic accidents in the coming years, particularly as the Baby Boomer generation's children reach driving age and join the roads in large numbers by 2010.",
            "In my exploration of the Library of Congress's repository of early Edison films, I chose to examine the collection of trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen films in total, most of which utilized clever editing techniques to create the illusion of something extraordinary. My focus was on deciphering the underlying structures that governed these trick films and identifying the anomalies that emerged in later examples. \n\nGenerally speaking, the early trick films were rooted in a specific aesthetic: they were composed within a fixed, frontal frame, characterized by stationary camera work, and adhered to a strict narrative structure. This involved long and medium shots, and a clear separation between each individual concept or event. However, some films from the early 20th century began to deviate from this model by incorporating more complex narrative techniques.\n\nOne of the defining features of the trick films was their consistent use of an interior set within a frontal frame. The camera remained stationary, never moving to follow actors or objects within the scene. This compositional style drew inspiration from the theatrical tradition, where it was commonly used in stage and vaudeville performances, as well as in magic shows. As a result, the actors in these films tended to move only horizontally, never approaching or receding from the camera. \n\nThe film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) exemplifies this characteristic, where characters enter from the right-hand side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains stationary, not following them.\n\nGiven the frontal composition style, shots in these films predominantly consisted of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were never used, and this was likely due to the influence of theatre and vaudeville, where the entire performance was visible within the frame of the stage. In line with this tradition, actors rarely, if ever, moved towards the camera, making close-ups impossible.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to a narrative structure that equated one conceptual shot with a single physical shot. This limited the length of these films to a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. Consequently, the trick films tended to focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick-switching sequences. However, a closer examination often reveals that a single conceptual shot can actually be composed of several joined shots, aimed at creating an illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, is a prime example. A detailed analysis reveals the exact moment where the physical shot containing Mary's \"decapitated\" head begins, even though the entire film is conceptually a single shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a stalwart advocate of the virtues inherent to Republicanism, driven by a profound dedication to the principles of individual liberty and limitations on government power. As an agriculturalist by trade, his profession and brief foray into politics instilled in him a stalwart commitment to upholding the values of a self-sufficient agrarian system. This foundational perspective shaped his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system, as he sought to preserve and promote the integrity of what he deemed the most honorable of occupations.\n\nTaylor believed that the nascent United States presented an unparalleled opportunity to forge an exemplary system of governance, unencumbered by the constraints of established tradition. He firmly believed in the inherent, interconnected nature of human rights, positing that the deprivation of one right would compromise the integrity of all, and thus, these rights should remain beyond the reach of government interference. He posited that the notion of a \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical prowess and cunning would dominate, but that in a civilized society, this hierarchy must not prevail.\n\nTo create a society that balances the inherent duality of human nature – comprising both good and evil – Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges and accommodates these complexities. He adhered to a rigorous moral dichotomy, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agricultural prosperity, and regulate capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be influenced by avarice and self-interest. Taylor posited that self-interest, while a fundamental driver of human behavior, becomes malevolent when it prioritizes the interests of sub-groups over the common good. A well-designed government was necessary to harness man's innate propensity for evil, while vigilantly monitoring its own actions to prevent the introduction of destructive principles.\n\nLike many ardent Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict, literal interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited Federal government with powers explicitly enumerated in the document. He recognized that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially despotic, yet cautioned that a simplistic, literal approach could lead to corruption. Furthermore, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly characterized the country as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon reviewing the data presented in Figure 17, a noticeable decrease in commuter log submissions became apparent during the third month of the project. This decline was somewhat concerning, and pinpointing the exact cause proved challenging. Several factors likely contributed to this decrease. The onset of winter at a New England campus typically leads to a decline in bicycle and pedestrian commutes, which may account for some of the drop. Additionally, the end of the fall semester coincided with the month of December, a time when students and faculty are usually preoccupied with schoolwork, grading, and other academic obligations, potentially pushing the commuter log to the backburner. Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, accompanied by a month-long break for students and faculty, resulting in a decrease in campus attendance.\n\nThe subsequent resumption of classes in late January may have also played a role in the low number of log submissions for that month. It is also possible that the natural enthusiasm for a new project may wane over time, leading to decreased participation. To combat this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign that aimed to revitalize the initiative. This effort resulted in an increase in log submissions for that month, indicating that targeted interventions can indeed help reinvigorate the project.\n\nAnother challenge we faced was the entrenched cultural preference for driving personal vehicles, which can make it difficult to encourage alternative modes of commuting. To mitigate this, we offered prizes in the form of gift cards to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. While these incentives were effective, it would be interesting to explore the impact of more substantial rewards, such as offering bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric vehicles. This could have helped to counteract the decline in engagement observed during the project. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, and it is possible that increasing the rewards over time may have had a more significant impact. For instance, announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles and hybrid cars, in December and January, respectively, may have sustained participation levels.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument that tracks a specific index, commodity, or a diverse portfolio of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on an exchange like individual stocks. This hybrid vehicle combines the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of single stock ownership, including the ability to engage in short sales, margin purchases, and transactions as low as a single share. While these perks are highly appealing, the expense ratios of ETFs are notably lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, investors should be aware that trading ETFs involves paying a commission, similar to buying individual stocks. Furthermore, the availability of a wide range of ETFs allows investors to select from various investment options.\n\nA case in point is the ETF IHF, which warrants closer examination. To determine whether owning a single ETF can replicate the benefits of a diversified portfolio and whether there are more optimal configurations of the constituent stocks, we will compare the top 10 holdings of the ETF IHF to the top 10 stocks in the underlying index. This exercise will provide valuable insights into the representativeness of the top 10 holdings and their potential to deliver superior returns and reduced risk.\n\nTo streamline the analysis, we have focused on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is the breakdown of the top 10 holdings along with their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge the effectiveness of the top 10 holdings in representing the ETF IHF, we have calculated their individual contributions to the Beta and Return of a hypothetical portfolio consisting of these stocks, weighted according to their holdings in the ETF. The results are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nA noteworthy observation from the chart is that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would have yielded a 6.11% higher return compared to the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF, indicating a lower level of risk. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with reduced volatility. However, it is essential to determine whether these results are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their collective volatility to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is often cited as a standout work among his oeuvre. Notably, the term \"Thulé\" appears in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott's research, this word has its origins in Virgil, who used it to describe a mythical island situated north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world in ancient Greek geography. However, a more contemporary source also merits consideration. Poe was known for his fascination with German literature.\n\nThis connection to Virgil's work is significant because it highlights Poe's literary influences, which extend beyond his American contemporaries. As Keith Sagar notes in his study of Poe's connection to European literature, the American poet was deeply interested in the works of German authors, including Goethe. Karl J. Arndt's book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" explores the similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe's work.\n\nA 19th-century literary encyclopedia, \"The Oxford Companion to English Literature,\" provides insight into Goethe's literary career. Goethe was a celebrated writer of poetic drama, particularly in his epic \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife gives him a goblet, only to pass away soon after. The king's grief is so intense that he becomes a recluse, drinking heavily and eventually decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Both characters grapple with loss and find solace in drinking. This connection may suggest that Goethe's work influenced Poe's writing, particularly in his use of similar narrative motifs. Furthermore, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land\" and in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" The poem \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as a companion piece to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thulé, characterized by darkness, loneliness, and a world drained of color. These themes are eerily reminiscent of the King of Thulé, who is also grappling with loss and isolation.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, it is likely that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. Tennyson's own writing style and themes may have contributed to Poe's interest in the German author. Moreover, the widespread reproduction and translation of Goethe's works in the 19th century would have made his writing accessible to a broader audience, including Poe.",
            "In California, a shopper who suffered an injury after slipping on an applesauce spill at a grocery store might potentially receive punitive damages if they can show that the store manager acted with a reckless disregard for the potential harm caused by allowing the spill to remain uncleaned. A court would be unlikely to dismiss out of hand the claim for punitive damages made by Jennifer Palmer, who slipped and fell on the spill at D&D Markets. To justify an award of punitive damages, Palmer would need to present evidence that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the potential harm that could result from allowing the spill to remain uncleaned. \n\nThe fact that Martin, the store manager, knew of the spill twice, at 5:00 pm and 5:15 pm, but failed to address it due to his dinner break, provides a strong basis for Palmer's argument. Furthermore, the store had experienced five slip-and-fall incidents prior to Palmer's accident, which suggests that Martin was aware of the potential hazards and should have taken steps to mitigate them. While it is debatable whether the manager's actions were malicious, the fact that the store had experienced multiple incidents in 2009 and failed to take adequate measures to maintain store safety weighs in Palmer's favor.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle, but Martin declined to address it, citing his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reported the spill to Martin, but he still failed to take action. It was not until 30 minutes later that the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The California Civil Code defines malice as conduct that is intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have found malice when a defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and willfully failed to avoid those consequences, demonstrating a reckless disregard for the safety of others.",
            "It has been four years since I had the opportunity to take a course in Islamic studies at my alma mater.  A recurring theme in that class was the debated notion of whether Islam is inherently a hostile faith.  This question remains increasingly pertinent today, particularly in light of the significant shifts in media portrayals of Islam and extremism over the past two decades.  The prospect of a presidential candidate with a Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unthinkable in the early 2000s.  In examining the life of the Prophet Muhammad, I've come to realize that the portrayal in his biography diverges from the common perception of his character.  Initially, I associated Muhammad with coercive tactics, forcing non-Muslims to convert to Islam through conquest.  However, the biography presents a more nuanced image of Muhammad as a misunderstood figure who conveyed his message through humility and compassion, drawing followers through personal encounter rather than coercion.\n\nI've also observed intriguing parallels between the lives and teachings of Jesus and Muhammad.  One example that stands out is the account of Muhammad multiply bread and milk to feed a group of forty men.  This narrative style, which emphasizes Muhammad's humility and lack of need for demonstration, has led me to wonder whether the intention was to downplay the significance of Jesus' miracles and teachings.  This perceived attempt to equate Muhammad's story with that of Jesus raises questions about the legitimacy of such a comparison.\n\nFurthermore, I've noticed that the biography often relies on secondary accounts of events, which can undermine the credibility of the narrative.  While the authors' intention may have been to provide testament to the truth of the stories, this approach can also create skepticism and raise suspicions about the validity of the information.  What bothers me most about this work, however, is its attempt to elevate Muhammad to a level of moral perfection, portraying him as wise, gentle, and endearing.  Historical records, however, suggest a more complex picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I often wonder whether modern Muslims are aware of the historical context surrounding his life.",
            "Throughout the history of Christianity, the principles laid down by Jesus during his lifetime have gradually become lost in the development of the faith.  If we examine the trajectory of Christian thought, a pattern emerges of increasing divergence from its foundational roots.  Today, we are witnessing a heightened awareness and a progressive shift in societal attitudes.  While traditionalists may resist any departures from established doctrine, their influence is unlikely to dictate the broader trajectory of the faith.  In the years to come, Christians are likely to exhibit a growing interest in uncovering the authentic essence of their faith, distinguishing the original teachings of Jesus from the subsequent additions and interpretations that have accumulated over time.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but ultimately, it will eventuate in a significant reversal of the dominant trend in Christian history.  A movement will emerge, steadily stripping away layers of doctrine, much like a hands of time moving in reverse, until only the core principles of Jesus' message remain.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will likely lead to a widespread shift towards a more fundamental understanding of the faith, with adherents reverting to a more pristine, authentic expression of the Christian vision.  The established church will continue to play a crucial role in guiding this process, albeit with a perspective shaped by a more streamlined, unified understanding of the faith.  As a result, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to a greater uniformity of belief and practice.  Instead of a multiplicity of perspectives and traditions, we will witness a growing convergence of views and practices across regions, denominations, and other divisions.  Historical precedents illustrate that such reversals can occur; for instance, the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually became a Christian-dominated institution.  Similarly, the United States has undergone significant transformations, moving from a society that once marginalized African-Americans to one that has elevated them to positions of leadership.  A comparable reversal is on the horizon for the Christian faith, as adherents seek to return to the fundamental sources of their beliefs.  To facilitate this process, a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' teachings will be necessary, one that interprets his words as rich in metaphor and symbolism, rather than taken at face value.  By examining the historical precedents, we can distill the essence of the original faith, tracing its roots back to its earliest manifestations in Judaism.  In the centuries preceding the Roman conquest of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Jewish thought was characterized by a deep commitment to monotheism, the revelatory nature of scripture, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  However, the Jewish community was not monolithic, comprising various factions such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the broader populace.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair offers a scathing critique of human nature, revealing a pervasive tendency towards self-interest and a lack of consideration for others. Sinclair masterfully portrays the corrupting influence of unchecked economic ambition, exemplified by the factory owners and managers who prioritize profit over people and the environment. The author's vivid descriptions of the industrial landscape, such as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\", underscore the devastating consequences of their actions.\n\nThe factory owners and managers display a callous disregard for the welfare of their employees and the surrounding ecosystem. They are willing to sacrifice the health and well-being of their workers in pursuit of economic gain, as Sinclair illustrates through the phrase \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". The absence of labor protections during the time period allowed these individuals to exploit their workers, forcing them to work excessively long hours in hazardous conditions without adequate compensation or support.\n\nThe novel suggests that the workers in Packingtown were effectively trapped in a system that prioritized profit over people. The lack of accessible resources and support mechanisms left them vulnerable to exploitation, with unions often serving only to further enrich themselves at the expense of the workers. Sinclair's description of the working class as a \"population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\" serves as a stark reminder of the dehumanizing effects of unchecked capitalism.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs various literary techniques to elicit a specific emotional response from his readers in The Great Gatsby. Effective use of these techniques varies among authors, and Fitzgerald is no exception. One striking method he employs is juxtaposing seemingly incongruous adjectives with nouns to create a distinct atmosphere. He also skillfully assigns symbolic meanings to objects and later leverages these connotations to convey deeper significance.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs the technique of imbuing colors with meaning, most notably white and gray. These colors are not merely descriptive elements, but serve as potent symbols that evoke a particular sentiment. The meanings attached to these colors are expertly woven throughout the novel, eventually manifesting in the reader's perception of pivotal objects. The dichotomy of white and gray is initially established as a representative of refinement and uniformity, respectively.\n\nThe former connotes an air of elegance and sophistication, while the latter suggests wear and age. This binary is consistently reinforced throughout the novel's commencement. The affluent characters, such as Daisy and Jordan, are frequently associated with white attire, as exemplified by Nick's \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party and Tom's \"white shirt\" during his encounter with Myrtle. Conversely, the presence of gray is often linked to the mundane and the ordinary, like the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nAs the narrative progresses, Fitzgerald skillfully subverts these initial associations, using white and gray to signify the lack of significance or uniformity in certain subjects. This process begins with Daisy, who is initially introduced as a vibrant and dynamic character. However, after a prolonged absence of these colors, her reappearance in a \"little white roadster\" subtly undermines her individuality, reducing her to a uniform and coveted object in Gatsby's eyes. This technique is repeated throughout the novel, as Fitzgerald employs white and gray to convey a sense of uniformity and lack of distinction in various characters and settings.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural sector, driven by its favorable climate and ample sunlight. The region's fertile landscape allows for a diverse range of crops to flourish, including fresh produce such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and an assortment of herbs. Berries, peaches, lemons, and other tree fruits are also cultivated in the area. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations operating lengthy waiting lists for their produce. Organic dairy products, including eggs and milk, are also highly sought after. Furthermore, several local farms offer guided tours, allowing visitors to explore the agricultural processes and enjoy activities like hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor pursuits. This model of sustainable agriculture not only enables landowners to tap into government incentives but also fosters a healthier environment, opening opportunities for recreational use, educational programs, and revenue generation.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming extend beyond economic gains. A notable advantage is the promotion of biodiversity in both plant and animal life, as a result of the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. Conversely, organic farming presents some challenges, including increased labor requirements for pest and weed management, soil fertilization, and the potential for higher losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often lack the efficiency and economies of scale associated with larger operations. Other environmentally beneficial practices, such as cover cropping, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, may also incur higher labor costs. Therefore, a landowner seeking to balance profitability with environmental stewardship may necessitate seeking financial assistance or expert guidance.\n\nThe hypothetical property in question is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the town of Potrero, California. The 160-acre parcel consists of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the land is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and woodcutters in the late 19th century. This specific property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nFor this project, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to identify potential cost-saving measures and strategies for maintaining wildlife-friendly agricultural practices.

            "The role of cultural nuances in the negotiation process cannot be overstated. Cultural identity is a multifaceted entity that encompasses both what it represents and what it does not. It resists simplistic categorization, defying labels such as \"uniform\" or \"singular.\" The notion that an entire nation or organization can be reduced to a single trait, like \"the stubbornness of Russians\" or \"the accommodating nature of the Japanese,\" is a gross oversimplification. While a general understanding of cultural tendencies can be beneficial, it is more productive to focus on the specific cultural dynamics that will impact the negotiation. By doing so, one can develop a more nuanced appreciation for how cultural attitudes will shape the conversation.\n\nFamiliarizing oneself with a foreign culture or perspective involves a range of approaches, from studying its history and evolution to acknowledging its biases and preconceptions. Rather than attempting to alter or judge a culture, it is essential to accept and work within its boundaries, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where a weaker bargaining position may be at play. When operating in unfamiliar territory, demonstrating respect for local customs and traditions can facilitate smoother communication and help break down cultural barriers.\n\nIt is also worth noting that cultural identity is not solely defined by national or international affiliations. Companies within a given nation can develop their unique corporate cultures, which may prioritize work-life balance, efficiency, or community engagement. These corporate cultures can be reflected in various aspects, such as employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, there is significant diversity in corporate culture, with notable variations between companies and regions. This highlights the importance of examining the complexities within a culture, rather than relying on surface-level generalizations.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying values of a culture is crucial, as they provide the foundation for its behavior and decision-making. For instance, in cultures where saving face or maintaining harmony is valued, a negotiator may be hesitant to publicly criticize their organization or superior. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize a strong work ethic, a negotiator may be more inclined to push for a hard bargain. By considering these cultural subtleties, a negotiator can better navigate the negotiation process and build a more effective relationship with their counterpart. Ultimately, learning about the personal values and perspectives of one's opponent can be invaluable in achieving a successful outcome.",
            "The notion that the absence of a higher authority is a notion that has been entertained by philosophers and theologians across various eras. The biblical passage found in Psalm 14, attributed to the Christian tradition, serves as a foundational text in the philosophical discourse on the existence of God. This idea is also central to the philosophical arguments of Thomas Aquinas, a medieval scholar whose works will be the subject of our examination alongside those of St. Anselm. To facilitate a comparative analysis, we will assume that both thinkers subscribe to a monotheistic worldview, specifically one grounded in the biblical narrative. A more nuanced understanding of their arguments would be compromised by assuming a more abstract or pantheistic notion of the divine. \n\nOur analysis suggests that while both thinkers present compelling arguments, neither provides a definitive basis for believing in the existence of a higher power. To demonstrate this, we will first examine the philosophical framework presented by St. Anselm. Anselm's argument posits that the existence of God can be inferred through introspection and rational inquiry. He contends that the concept of God's nonexistence is inherently self-contradictory, and therefore, can be excluded from consideration. This perspective implies that the evidence for God's existence can be found within the realm of human consciousness, rendering external evidence unnecessary. This perspective is reflective of the Christian emphasis on faith as a foundation for belief.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a more empirically grounded argument for the existence of God. He suggests that reason and evidence can provide a conclusive proof of God's existence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach has significant implications for evangelism and the dissemination of religious ideas, as it allows for the persuasion of new converts through logical reasoning rather than reliance on unverifiable assertions. Aquinas develops five distinct arguments for the existence of God, each of which relies on the logical necessity of a higher power. These arguments include the concepts of change, causality, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, demonstrating that the existence of God can be inferred through the analysis of observable phenomena and logical deduction.",
            "A significant figure, destined to be called the Buddha, emerged in the 5th or 6th century BCE. Over time, he abandoned worldly life and achieved enlightenment, setting in motion a legacy that has endured for approximately 2,500 years. The resultant philosophy, Buddhism, has undergone notable transformations, especially within the Theravada tradition, which is widely regarded as its most authentic expression. The evolution of this ancient faith is exemplified in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony has become an integral part of the cultural landscape. Although this celebration is not directly referenced in the Buddha's teachings, it highlights the divergences between past and present, encompassing everything from superficial customs to the fundamental principles of the faith. As the Theravada community, encompassing both monastic and lay adherents, has navigated the passage of time, its doctrine has adapted to external and internal influences, ranging from hostile and benevolent forces.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, certain key terms will be employed. Internal forces are defined as those emanating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation, while external forces are those originating from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that intentionally or unintentionally harm the Buddhist community, often motivated by negative perceptions of the faith. Conversely, benign forces neither aim to harm nor assist the community, although they may inadvertently have an impact. These definitions will be referenced frequently throughout this analysis.\n\nTo establish a foundation for further exploration, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents take refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the three baskets of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka, which contains the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary guidelines; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which addresses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key concepts within the latter include Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (the impermanence of all phenomena). Recognizing these principles is crucial for transcending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which perpetuates itself continuously. Ultimately, enlightenment will also bring an end to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes rules for lay and monastic adherents, including the five precepts for the laity (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in inappropriate conduct, and I shall not consume intoxicants) and a more extensive set of disciplinary guidelines for monks. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the concept of the four noble truths: Dukkha (the reality of suffering), the causal relationship between attachment and suffering, and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "The complex and often contentious relationship between the United States and Mexico serves as a prime example of a longstanding rivalry between neighboring nations that spanned an impressive 57-year period, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The conflict reached a boiling point during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States emerge victorious and secure significant territorial gains, including Texas and the American Southwest, as a result of its military campaigns against Mexico. However, this was not an isolated incident, as numerous other clashes and disputes took place between the two nations, ultimately subsiding on the eve of World War I.\n\nThis rivalry was rooted in fundamental differences between the two nations, particularly with regards to religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). Similar dynamics can be observed in other nations sharing a common border, where the convergence of interests often leads to the formation of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are not unique in this regard, as David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico, along with Cuba, represent longstanding challenges to American foreign policy (p. 41). Their geographical proximity to the United States and historical rivalries have contributed to the perpetuation of tensions between the two nations, distinguishing them from other Latin American countries that have traditionally enjoyed more amicable relations with the United States.\n\nThe influence of religion played a significant role in fostering this divide, as Sally Frahm (2001) points out that \"in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, whereas in the 20th century, their focus shifted to fascism and communism\" (p. 86). In this context, the ideological struggles between the United States and Mexico were, to a large extent, driven by differing religious preferences. The historical legacy of distrust between the English and Spanish further complicated the establishment of harmonious diplomatic relations between the two nations. As a result, the United States and Mexico inherited a legacy of mutual distrust from their colonial past, which significantly hindered the development of a more cooperative relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) have documented 17 notable disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year period of rivalry. The majority of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge that was eventually addressed through increased military presence on both sides of the border (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States (p. 109) and eventually subsided as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the later part of the 19th century.",
            "It's been fifteen years since my life took an unexpected turn due to a health condition that caught me off guard. At the time, I was in my mid-forties and a nurse, having chosen my profession as a way to secure a stable future. Growing up, I often heard that no matter what, I could always rely on a steady income due to the demands of healthcare. However, my aspirations lay elsewhere - in the worlds of science and journalism, preferably a combination of both. \n\nThe reality hit hard: I was left unable to work, with limited savings and no financial security. To this day, I rely on disability benefits, and I've had to adapt to a life that's uncertain and often challenging. Despite the difficulties, I've come to appreciate the support of my loved ones and a handful of loyal friends. Their assistance has been a lifeline, and I've learned that even the strongest individuals can't navigate every obstacle alone.\n\nLife is unpredictable, and emergencies can arise without warning. No matter how prepared we think we are, there will always be situations that exceed our capacity to cope. I firmly believe that rather than placing all our faith in a single entity, we should focus on rebuilding community and fostering a culture of mutual support. By doing so, we can break down the myth of individualism and rediscover the values that truly made America great: compassion, cooperation, and a willingness to lend a helping hand.\n\nI'm not advocating for a complete reliance on the government. On the contrary, I think we'd be better off if Americans learned to trust and help one another. We should strive to be prepared, just as I have been - with a well-stocked emergency kit, a supply of essential items, and a basic understanding of self-sufficiency. If feasible, having a small garden or a wood stove can be a valuable asset. However, it's equally important to cultivate relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors. By doing so, we can build a stronger, more resilient community that's better equipped to face the unexpected challenges life throws our way.",
            "In exploring the intricacies of evolutionary processes, one cannot help but wonder: what drives organisms to evolve in the manner that they do? Are there underlying constraints that influence the trajectory of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson penned in 1917 that the task of defining organic forms in mathematical terms was a distant dream for zoologists, this challenge remains a pressing concern today. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have seen its application in the field of mollusk skeletogenesis, with notable contributions from researchers such as Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur research delves into the realm of mathematical modeling, combining it with experimental studies to elucidate the mechanisms governing evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. By leveraging X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we have identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters have been input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995), enabling us to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a dynamic structure that traverses 360 degrees of spatial space over time. The successive coils of a shell are known as whorls, which appear to spiral around a central axis, or columella. This axis extends through the shell's central column, separating each whorl from the next by a continuous line, or suture. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, resulting in a complex arrangement of whorls. In most shells, the final whorl is the largest, or body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the base being the opposite end. The aperture serves as the opening through which the animal emerges.\n\nShells can be observed from various vantage points, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, an apertural view is employed, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex oriented upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves initially viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture. A dividing line is then drawn, and whorls are counted from this point, with estimates made to a quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell can be regarded as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture through coordinates representing the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, it is possible to chart the trajectory of the shell's development. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing for the manipulation of parameters and the modification of the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality has encountered a plateau over the past decade, despite notable advancements in other areas, such as water and sanitation, aligning with the country's Millennium Development Goals. However, the sluggish pace of improvement in child and maternal health remains a pressing concern, with a significant gap to bridge before the target goals of 2015 can be achieved. Several critical factors contributing to this stagnation will be examined below, underscoring the necessity of fortifying the healthcare system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in increasing the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% now meeting this benchmark. Notwithstanding this progress, the category still encompasses traditional birth attendants, such as midwives, who may not possess the requisite medical expertise to intervene in complicated pregnancies, thereby perpetuating high rates of maternal mortality due to hemorrhage. Consequently, the improvement in this metric may be misleading, and substantial work remains to be done. Furthermore, a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases among children under five treated by a healthcare professional is also a cause for concern, with incomplete data on postnatal care revealing persistently low rates nationwide.\n\nThe relatively low cesarean-section rate of 4% in Indonesia raises additional concerns, with the urban-rural disparity further exacerbating the issue. While the rate of cesarean sections stands at 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural settings, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services across the country. Moreover, the significant 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles indicates that access to healthcare services is concentrated in urban areas, leaving the poor disproportionately disadvantaged due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can Indonesia most effectively address the dearth of services? Specifically, should the country opt for targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system, prioritizing comprehensive maternal and child care over piecemeal interventions? While programmatic approaches offer the allure of targeted objectives and swift results, they also harbor several drawbacks. For instance, investing heavily in one sector often comes at the expense of other areas, diverting resources and personnel to the more lucrative or high-profile initiatives, as evident in the case of HIV/AIDS and family planning. Moreover, the proliferation of parallel programs within a single sector can lead to duplication of services, inefficient coordination, and increased administrative burdens, including redundant forms, paperwork, and funding requirements.",
            "Victorian fiction is distinguished by its meticulousness and preoccupation with the upper echelons of society.  Two novels that diverge from this convention are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which instead incorporate elements of enigma and peculiarity.  By leveraging these unconventional narrative techniques, the authors create a sense of intrigue that propels the reader deeper into the interior lives of their characters, offering a more nuanced understanding of their motivations and emotional states.\n\nAs Dickens describes in Oliver Twist, the blend of reality and dream-like scenarios serves to heighten the sense of uncertainty and tension.  This is exemplified in the following passage: \"And now, a multitude of bewildering ideas crowded his mind; he seemed to still be walking alongside Sikes and Crackit, who were quarreling: the words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he caught his attention, he found himself in conversation with them... He jerked back at the sound of gunfire; a chorus of cries and shouts filled the air, and lights danced before his eyes. The commotion subsided as suddenly as it began, leaving behind a vague, nagging sense of pain that gnawed at him relentlessly.\"\n\nThe two novels make use of dream sequences or dream-like states to achieve this effect, albeit in distinctly different ways. In Oliver Twist, these disorienting episodes often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, exposing his vulnerabilities and the depth of his emotional pain. When Oliver is forced to relive the shooting in Chapter 28, his vivid recollection is akin to a dream, as he desperately seeks assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's loss of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his physical state, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting event overwhelms him, rendering him numb and disconnected from his surroundings; his despair is re-experienced, now infused with a sense of fear rather than shock. This sequence raises questions about the agency behind Oliver's misfortune, implying that it was not his own doing. Furthermore, it suggests that Oliver's growing sense of hopelessness is a testament to Fagin's influence, which has eroded his ability to react or take control of his fate.\n\nIn a subsequent passage from Wuthering Heights, the author writes: \"The day passed – it was more like night; the day was gone as soon as it began – and night fell once more; a long, oppressive silence, punctuated by fleeting moments.\"",
            "I worked in an after-school program about two years ago, where I provided academic support to elementary school students. My expertise lay in English and reading, but I was eager to assist students struggling in various subjects. One student, Adrian, was particularly memorable. He was a third or fourth grader who faced reading challenges. What struck me was the inconsistency in his reading abilities – he would accurately pronounce some letters but struggle with others. His proficiency in spoken English was impressive, but his reading difficulties were unrelated to language comprehension. His mother, whose native language was Spanish, communicated with me through limited Spanish, which I struggled to understand. The revelation that dawned on me was that Adrian's reading difficulties stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet.\n\nThis experience resonates with the broader issue of language barriers in education, particularly in California. It highlights that even fluent English speakers can struggle with reading, and assumptions about a student's language proficiency may be misleading. The solution for Adrian was straightforward: targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the issue is more complex. There is no single solution, and a combination of approaches is necessary.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising approach for students whose first language is not English. Research has shown that students in bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Critics argue that it's resource-intensive and may not benefit all students, but this is not necessarily true. Implementing dual language programs as the norm, rather than the exception, would benefit all students. To make this feasible, we could introduce bilingual support staff, rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual. This could include tutors, aides, or other educational assistants who can provide targeted support to students with language barriers.",
            "The notion of a transcendent force greater than ourselves is ingrained in us from an early age, often through the teachings of our caregivers or the pursuit of self-discovery. Some people adhere to established spiritual frameworks, while others reject these concepts outright, convinced that our individual experiences encompass the entirety of existence. Our perception of spirituality is a dynamic, evolving process, as we navigate various value systems and philosophies in search of meaning. The desire for illumination in the darkness drives us forward, illuminating our path and casting aside the shadows.\n\nAs I sat with my father on our porch, the sound of rain pattering against the tin roof created a somber atmosphere. The gutters, overflowing with water, drowned the plants that lined the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of introspection and reminiscence. His physical appearance had changed – his frame had grown thinner, his clothes hung loosely on his body, and his hair had begun to recede. I felt a sense of isolation and trepidation, but couldn't bring myself to discuss my concerns about his deteriorating health, as acknowledging them would only make the reality more unbearable for both of us.\n\nWe sat together in silence, the only sound the raindrops hitting the roof. I inched my chair closer to his, and together we gazed out into the twilight, the rain creating a soothing melody. My father passed away that December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the projected timeline, but at what cost, I couldn't rationalize. In the stillness of the night, I found myself questioning the existence of a higher power, wondering if it had ever truly listened to my pleas.\n\nI didn't attend his passing, unable to bear watching the life that shaped me slip away. Instead, I chose to remember my father through his accomplishments and the time we shared, rather than the circumstances of his departure. I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. For three days, I remained in a state of emotional numbness, awaiting the news that would forever alter my life.\n\nThe phone remained silent, a stark reminder of the emptiness that had descended upon me.",
            "The label 'Gothic Novel' is a paradoxical term that encapsulates both the timeless and the novel, a dichotomy first noted by Ian Watt in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has been subject to various interpretations, ranging from criticism to praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth, while others see it as an exemplar of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The foundational 'Gothic Novel', Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the legacies of both ancient and modern romance to forge a new literary path. By merging venerable theatrical elements with the modern novel's capacity for introspection, Walpole created a unique blend, which he termed a 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently incorporates references to medieval theatricality, architecture, and cultural heritage. Even at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term 'gothic' was applied to a wide range of contexts, often carrying connotations of antiquity or unsophistication in comparison to the progress of modern society and literature. The fusion of the theatrical and the novelistic, with their respective emphasis on spectacle and psychological insight, has allowed the Gothic genre to endure, achieving a paradoxical state of obsolescence and renewal for readers separated from its original context.\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of the Gothic novel is its engagement with the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, as a code of conduct for knights, is reinterpreted and reimagined in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds a particular significance for Gothic writers, who saw it as a symbol of the noble knight, exemplifying virtues such as bravery, honor, and competence. However, they also perceived a decline from this ideal in their contemporary society, which led them to idealize and romanticize the 'gothic past' (hinting at the eventual evolution of Gothic into Romanticism). In Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, this nostalgia for a lost era is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits and is described as:\n\nFrederic's characterization is noteworthy for its traditional associations with the chivalric ideal. As a prince, he has experienced suffering, been marked by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the 'gallant and courteous knight' is, of course, an exaggeration, which serves to introduce the Gothic trope of excess (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management encompasses the intricate network of processes that facilitate the movement of goods from raw materials to customers. This complex system was first conceptualized in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a renowned consultant. Oliver's work underscored the importance of orchestrating the various stages of supply chain management, from procurement to distribution, to satisfy customer needs in an efficient and timely manner. Six pivotal elements comprise the supply chain framework: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Skilled managers adeptly utilize these components to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundational stage of the supply chain, laying the groundwork for the entire process. It involves determining the optimal production strategy, encompassing factors such as when, where, and how goods will be manufactured. Managers must conduct market research to gauge customer demand, which serves as a critical determinant in informing production decisions. By analyzing market trends and customer preferences, managers can determine the products to be manufactured, their quantities, and the most suitable production locations, taking into account factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction.\n\nIn a well-structured supply chain, production planning is closely intertwined with scheduling and maintenance. Managers must meticulously coordinate workloads and maintenance tasks to ensure seamless operations. The slightest misstep can lead to substantial time and financial losses in the long run. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have implemented comprehensive design guidelines, inclusive of detailed protocols for uniform design, receiving shipments, and other operational aspects. This structured approach enables smooth execution and minimizes confusion among employees.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each equipped with distinct equipment, personnel, and specialized skills. Managers must select the most suitable division for each process and consider outsourcing work to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to provide high-quality products while maintaining cost-effectiveness.",
            "A shocking claim is emblazoned on a makeshift sign, held aloft by the actress Ellen Page on a city street. The stark message, scrawled in bold letters, appears to suggest that a certain historical figure is alive and residing in a country shrouded in controversy. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been under the iron-fisted rule of a military junta since 1962, following a coup that seized power from its democratically elected government. In 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, led by a large contingent of Buddhist monks. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these demonstrations drew international attention, with the monks seeking greater freedoms and an end to the military's grip on power. However, the government's response was swift and brutal, with reports of violence and human rights abuses mounting. Foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who ultimately lost his life, were targeted by the authorities, while the official death toll was significantly lower than the estimates of those on the ground. According to Colonel Hla Win, a former military officer who defected to the opposition, the true extent of the violence was far more severe, with thousands of civilians killed.\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. The desire for absolute control and the suppression of dissent has been a hallmark of authoritarian regimes throughout history. From ancient Rome, where emperors claimed divine right to rule, to Japan, where the emperor is still revered as a deity, the pattern of oppression has been a constant. In more recent times, the world has witnessed numerous examples of governments cracking down on their citizens. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals clashed with the government, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias and government forces targeted Tutsis and moderates, are just two instances of the devastating consequences of unchecked power. The atrocities committed during the Holocaust, a period of genocide orchestrated by the Nazi regime, also serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed, in large part, to his remarkable longevity and his unparalleled ability to shape the sound of his orchestra. While often taking a discreet role on the piano, Ellington proved himself a master composer who skillfully highlighted the individual talents of his band members. By crafting a rich and intricate framework for improvisation, Ellington's compositions seamlessly integrated soloists and ensembles, yielding works of great musicality and coherence. His expertise in recognizing the unique timbres of each player, as well as their interaction within the ensemble, enabled him to create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nA testament to Ellington's innovative approach is evident in his use of voice as a melodic instrument, as exemplified by Creole Love Call. This early piece showcases his ability to liberate the voice from the constraints of lyrics, incorporating it as a distinct timbre and texture. Notably, this slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues work features six distinct choruses, each showcasing a different facet of Ellington's compositional talent.\n\nChorus 1 establishes a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic tone before shifting to a more rugged, emotive quality. Chorus 2 features a muted trumpet solo, elaborating on the basic melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. Chorus 3 showcases a soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band reprise the first chorus, with the brass and reed sections engaging in a call-and-response dialogue. Chorus 5 is the climactic peak of the piece, with the reeds initiating the call-and-response in a high register, while the brass and rhythm sections contribute a syncopated, stop-time rhythm. Chorus 6 returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting a growling, instrumental timbre.\n\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag, featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, novelty ending by a trombone. Ellington's use of voice as a means of adding tonal color is a hallmark of his compositional style, evident throughout his body of work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his acute sensitivity to timbre. The piece features a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, seamlessly integrating the vocal aspects of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further exemplifying his ability to bring out the unique qualities of each player.",
            "She felt a persistent void within herself, an unfulfilled longing that had persisted since adolescence. The sensation had begun to nag at her when she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of her teenage years. Now, at 17, the ache remained, albeit with a subtle shift in focus. She yearned for human connection, rather than mere objects or superficial experiences. However, her disinterest in the boys who showed interest in her had left her bewildered, prompting her to introspect on the underlying reasons for this anomaly. \n\nAs she pondered her desires, she led a relatively peaceful life at home, surrounded by parents who exuded calm and tranquility. They rarely argued, and when they did, it was usually about her pursuit of independence and self-expression. This dichotomy created an intriguing dynamic, as her lively personality and kind nature endeared her to those around her.\n\nOn this particular day, though, the atmosphere was far from serene. As she moved through the house, searching for inspiration, she was startled by the unmistakable sound of her mother's distress call from the kitchen. The urgency in her voice sent her daughter rushing to her side, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" The mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain, and repeatedly whispered, \"Ow.\" The girl sprang into action, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder and asking, \"Aunt, what's wrong?\" Her mother managed to urge her on, her words laced with pain and urgency, \"T-take me to the hospital.\" The daughter swiftly obliged, carefully lifting her mother and guiding her to the car. She had been fortunate to have taken those self-defense classes, which allowed her to support her mother effortlessly.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and the anxiety-filled atmosphere were unmistakable, but her daughter's focus remained fixed on her mother's well-being. She briskly entered the emergency room, calling out for medical assistance, and soon a team of concerned faces gathered around. A rolling bed was brought in, and her mother was quickly assessed by the doctors. The daughter was left to anxiously wait, her eyes fixed on the medical team as they worked to assess and treat her mother's injury.\n\nIt was later revealed that her mother had suffered a fall from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "A comprehensive research endeavor aimed to investigate the correlation between adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (Med diet) and the incidence of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke-related mortality. The study employed a modified version of the Med diet, known as the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, which incorporates increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant-based proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption was permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a negative association between adherence to the Med diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. A notable intervention study revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, prior research did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation involved a sample of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the aMed diet score using self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. Notably, more than 95% of the participants maintained their involvement throughout the study period. The FFQs were subject to validation studies to ensure accuracy.\n\nIncident cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions. Covariates, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, were calculated for each FFQ. Additionally, leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from multiple FFQs were calculated. Adjustments were made for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nA Cox proportional-hazard model was employed to examine the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe findings revealed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. Notably, women in the top aMed quintile demonstrated a reduced risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The financial landscape of the United States underwent a significant downturn in 2007, as unemployment rates rose and the housing market teetered on the brink of collapse. Several prominent corporations found themselves on the precipice of insolvency, prompting a critical examination of the factors that contributed to this crisis. It is essential to investigate the root causes of this calamity and explore potential avenues for mitigation. A cursory analysis suggests that a combination of reckless and shortsighted policy decisions ultimately led to the widespread issuance of sub-prime loans within an underdeveloped financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were incentivized to purchase and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, which ultimately proved to be a recipe for disaster.\n\nA critical examination of historical data reveals that the seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration. In an effort to boost his popularity and secure a second term, the President relaxed lending regulations, creating a fertile ground for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. A prescient article by Steven Holmes, published in the New York Times in 1999, warned of the consequences of such actions: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's leading underwriter of home mortgages, has come under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also facing pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes' insightful commentary was a harbinger of the impending economic downturn, which would ultimately precipitate a government-led bailout reminiscent of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nSeveral interrelated factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the proliferation of novel and complex mortgage products such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments served to entwine various sectors of the economy with the housing market, rendering households and financial institutions perilously exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. As the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities found themselves reeling from the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported an astonishing $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The fallout from this crisis was severe: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at rock-bottom prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to undergo a dramatic transformation, subjecting themselves to intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, found themselves burdened with an staggering $5 trillion in mortgage debt, prompting their government-led takeover in September 2008.",
            "The art of exposition - that treacherous stretch of narrative where even the most skilled writers risk losing their audience.  It's the section where the goal is to engage, to enthrall, yet all too often, the opposite occurs: readers disengage, hitting the back button or succumbing to torpor. Dr. Emma Jenkins' reaction to such passages is not unlike that of a pilot confronted with a sudden turbulence - she finds herself shouting at her monitor, frustration and annoyance mingling on her face.\n\nExposition is an obstacle many writers face.  Even those familiar with the fundamental \"Show, don't tell\" principle can find themselves sliding into lengthy descriptions of events that fail to propel the story forward.  It's the insidious voice within, urging the author to introduce background information, often in the guise of efficiency, only to bog down the narrative in the process.\n\nIn film, exposition can manifest as a character's lengthy monologue, reminiscent of Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, it's the author's attempt to convey crucial details through direct telling.  A telling example comes to mind: a heroine's backstory, detailing her meeting with a charming partner, their wedding, and the tragic loss of that partner.  Typically, this sequence would unfold over several pages, but with sparse dialogue and underdeveloped characters.  However, a more engaging approach would delve deeper into the husband's character, revealing his love for the heroine through his words and actions.  Similarly, the heroine's transformation, sparked by her relationship, would be skillfully woven into the narrative.  The reader would develop an emotional connection with the characters, investing in their experiences and relationships.  This would make the eventual loss more impactful, fostering a deeper understanding of the heroine's psyche.\n\nIn essence, the storyline \"They met, they married, he died\" needs fleshing out.  As a writer, it's essential to resist the urge to gloss over pivotal moments.  Consider the character of a former Air Force pilot, now managing a gas station by night, with a complicated past and secret aspirations.  A single line about his background may be tempting, but it's the subtleties - his mannerisms, speech patterns, and desires - that bring him to life, making him a believable and relatable figure.  The key is to provide depth, not just brevity.",
            "I viewed a pair of newscasts originating from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The initial broadcast, which aired live on NBC 4, reported on a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. A male individual, identified as Shad Hostettler, was taken into custody following an alleged attack on his wife. Despite the gravity of the situation, the story was only allotted two minutes, likely due to its developing nature. While the details were limited, it was stated that the attack involved multiple stab wounds.\n\nThe subsequent report focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which left an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers, critically injured. No arrests had been made, and the SWAT Team was actively investigating the case. A notable aspect of this story was its brevity, which may have been influenced by various factors, including the socio-economic context of the neighborhood.\n\nAnother story highlighted the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators suspected a .22 caliber bullet, likely fired from a rifle, as the cause of the damage. A reward of $5,000 was announced for information leading to the apprehension of the perpetrator.\n\nThe weather forecast for the upcoming weekend predicted thunderstorms and rain, with temperatures ranging from the mid to low eighties. The segment was brief, possibly to pique viewers' interest in tuning in for further updates.\n\nA story about a robbery at a Clime Road convenience store in Columbus also aired. The suspect, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie, had allegedly targeted the store. The news anchor devoted significant time to emphasizing the suspect's racial characteristics, which may have been excessive given the circumstances.\n\nFinally, a report was aired about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation spanning from Texas to Ohio. The defendant had been sentenced to 300 months in prison, a sentence that was phrased in a manner that may have been intended to convey a sense of severity. Notably, the anchor highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, although this detail seemed peripheral to the story.",
            "A deep and intricate connection exists between brothers, forged from an intricate tapestry of emotions. This bond encompasses a broad spectrum of feelings, including love, pride, resentment, and even a hint of malice. Brothers possess a unique understanding of one another, one that transcends their relationships with others. When gazing into the eyes of a sibling, they catch a glimpse of their own reflection, stripped of external influences. This profound insight is often revealed in the most trying of circumstances, showcasing the complexities of their bond. As these emotions unfold, they carry significant consequences, and it is through navigating these repercussions that one comes to grasp the essence of fraternal ties.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, weaving it throughout a rich, vivid narrative. Against the backdrop of a lush, evocative landscape, two brothers embark on a perilous journey, marked by bitter disappointment and intense pride. Ultimately, only one brother escapes unscathed. The author skillfully conveys the complexities of their bond through the protagonist's character development and interactions with his sibling, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective. This narrative voice effectively communicates the intricate emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him, which greatly influences his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, his relationship with his younger brother, Doodle, is characterized by a sense of disillusionment. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could share in his adventures, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's fragile health renders these aspirations unattainable, leaving the protagonist's dreams shattered. The disparity between his expectations and reality sparks a mix of emotions within him, including a fleeting desire to abandon his brother. Yet, even this dark impulse is tempered by the child's simple, radiant smile, which reawakens a deep and enduring love for his sibling. This paradox highlights the complexity of the protagonist's feelings, revealing a duality of emotions that underscores the true nature of their bond.",
            "The human brain is a complex, dynamic system of information processing that has evolved in tandem with advancements in technology. The metaphors employed to describe this system have also undergone significant revisions, progressing from analogies rooted in ancient writing materials like wax tablets and papyrus to more contemporary comparisons with modern computing devices. While these analogies offer a useful framework for comprehension, it is essential to recognize their limitations, which can lead to misinterpretation. \n\nThe process of information processing begins with the conversion of physical stimuli from sensory organs, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. These sensory inputs are then repeatedly transformed through a hierarchical process, involving both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box against a white background, the system initially assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries – where the color changes significantly over a short distance – to form a representation of a box. Subsequently, top-down processing leverages prior decisions to expedite the recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped void.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain level, a regulatory mechanism determines its priority and allocates it to specific cognitive processes. For example, although the brain processes every blade of grass when gazing at one's shoes, a healthy regulatory mechanism prevents individual blades from being consciously perceived. Conversely, one might readily identify their name in a noisy environment. This hierarchical process of information processing involves multiple stages, with the regulatory mechanism modulating the flow of information at every step.\n\nIn order for information to be processed, it must first be stored in the brain. There are various types of memory, each with distinct characteristics, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with encoding techniques varying depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural, phonetic, or semantic properties. Following encoding, information is maintained through various mechanisms. Some research suggests that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a specific sequence of neurons for a brief period. In contrast, long-term memory is thought to be preserved through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nSeveral theoretical models have been proposed to explain the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing from diverse disciplines such as psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, the node \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be connected to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel Brave New World, the author critiques the looming threats of technological advancement and the capitalist framework that supports it. The society, where collective happiness is prioritized over individuality, is conditioned from an early age to pursue fleeting pleasure above all else. The inhabitants, it appears, are mere pawns in a grand game controlled by the World Controller, forced to conform to a singular ideology. By examining the work through the lens of Marxist theory, one can discern Huxley's underlying concerns regarding the emergence of these societal systems.\n\nThe novel employs Marxist concepts to satirize capitalism, utilizing the notion of false consciousness to illustrate how the common citizenry is prevented from understanding their true relationships with other economic classes. This is achieved through ideological control, as seen in the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which instills a desire for consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this drive, ensuring the lower classes remain oblivious to their exploitation. The concept of hegemony, which describes the domination of social groups by a separate class, is exemplified in Brave New World, where the lower classes are unaware of their manipulation and the upper classes either accept their station or remain passive.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in the novel are superficial, lacking depth and distinction, which may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and emotional expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance, as seen in the characters' comments about one another. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class within the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority so long as they conform and continue to consume.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years now, which translates to about four and a half semesters. For many, myself included, navigating the campus can be quite a challenge. During my freshman year, I was housed in East Halls dorm, situated at the farthest eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building, located near the center of campus, often took up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. A conversation with an alumnus closer to my age revealed that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been repurposed with the addition of sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, moving from one place to another is becoming increasingly complicated. In a college setting, one possible solution to this issue is the bicycle. Nevertheless, having a bike is merely half the solution; students need to utilize it regularly, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a several-year hiatus sparked some interesting insights. He remarked, \"Cycling is an excellent option; for a few years, it wasn't seen as fashionable to ride a bike, but it's the most practical way to get around.\" In addition to the physical benefits, cycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. With a nutritious meal and moderate physical exertion, you can cover distances of over 30 miles. As someone who now resides off-campus, I'm situated at a similar distance from the campus center as some dorms. The most sensible decision I made this year was purchasing a bike. Daily classes at Thomas building, roughly a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reached in just 5 minutes by bike if I pedal at a moderate pace. My main concern is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, can be a challenging road to navigate, regardless of whether I'm on a bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, I find myself too time-pressed to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation to class, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. Considering all the other time I'd spend walking to and from classes, appointments, and other activities, that's a significant chunk of time I could ill afford to devote."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",

After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "As I pursue my academic and professional ambitions in social work, I am drawn to the field's potential for personal and professional growth, particularly within the realm of the Division of Family and Children Services. My objective is to create a positive impact on the lives of children who have been abused or neglected, as well as to provide support to families experiencing turmoil. My core values, which are deeply ingrained in my personal and professional philosophy, include a commitment to service, respect, and a steadfast dedication to upholding the highest standards of ethics. These values are not merely professional ideals; they are an integral part of my personal identity and inform my approach to building meaningful relationships with others and continually refining my professional skills to remain effective in my field.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have been driven by a strong desire to make a difference in the lives of others. However, I struggled to identify a clear career path that aligned with my passions. As I transitioned from high school to college, I witnessed firsthand the ways in which individuals often cope with adversity in less-than-ideal ways. This experience, combined with my academic foundation in psychology, led me to take a deliberate break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009. It was during this time that I had a profound encounter with a young individual who was struggling with the aftermath of abuse. This experience not only deepened my understanding of the complexities of social issues but also instilled in me a sense of purpose and direction. I began to seriously consider a career in social work as a means of addressing the needs of vulnerable populations.\n\nOne of the key principles that underpins social work is the pursuit of social justice. In our society, we often prioritize the notion of individuality, yet we often conform to traditional norms and expectations. I believe that this dichotomy is a pressing issue that warrants attention. As someone who values uniqueness and self-expression, I have consistently challenged societal norms throughout my academic and personal life. Whether through artistic expression, activism, or community engagement, I have consistently advocated for social justice and equality. My experiences have taught me the importance of staying true to one's values and principles, even in the face of adversity. I am committed to continuing this work in my future career as a social worker.",
            "This paper presents an examination of the biological and sociocultural frameworks that underpin insomnia, a complex sleep disorder. The biological model focuses on the interplay between genetic inheritance and physiological factors, while the sociocultural model explores the impact of environmental influences, including demographic, socio-economic, and ethnic factors. This review will delve into the research underlying these models, analyzing the strengths and limitations of each study and its relevance to our understanding of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can be categorized as a primary sleep disorder, a secondary sleep disorder related to a mental health condition, or a sleep disorder resulting from medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders include Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias encompassing insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, and other conditions not specified. Insomnia is characterized by persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep. In contrast, Parasomnias involve behavioral and physiological anomalies, including nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and other conditions not specified.\n\nThis analysis will focus on the biological model, which posits that sleep disorders are influenced by genetic and physiological factors. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. A recent study on mice found that the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons is essential for modulating sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of the receptor reduces anxiety and induces sleep. Furthermore, administration of the GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting that this receptor plays a critical role in sleep regulation. These findings imply that genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of sleep disorders in humans. The sociocultural implications of this research are significant, as the inheritance of a phenotype affecting the GABAB receptor could disrupt sleep patterns, with far-reaching consequences for daily life, including academic and professional performance.",
            "The complexities of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) encompass a multifaceted spectrum of auditory processing difficulties. This paper will delve into three key areas of CAPD: its definition, diagnosis, and the role of educators in supporting students with this condition within mainstreamed classrooms.\n\nAt its core, CAPD revolves around how the central nervous system processes auditory information, which is a critical aspect of our ability to interpret and understand the world around us (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, CAPD specifically refers to the brain's ability to decipher auditory signals, which is essential for distinguishing speech from background noise and recognizing patterns within sound (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). While individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing, their brains struggle to allocate and prioritize auditory input, resulting in difficulties with auditory processing.\n\nHistorically, researchers have made significant strides in understanding CAPD. The concept dates back to the mid-1950s, when researchers first identified \"auditory imperception\" as a critical aspect of communicative disorders (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Notably, Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari pioneered standardized testing for children with CAPD in the early 1950s, while Kimura's groundbreaking work on dichotic testing in 1961 shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying auditory perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A pivotal conference in 1977 further galvanized research into CAPD in children.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD exhibit a range of processing challenges, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple auditory events, recognizing patterns, and differentiating tone and pitch (Ferre). They may also struggle to differentiate between competing sounds, synthesize sound cues, and understand the sequence of auditory information (Ferre). These challenges can manifest in various ways, such as difficulty identifying sarcasm or detecting changes in speech.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD requires a comprehensive assessment, which may involve systematic observation, questionnaires, and performance on standardized tests (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a variety of tools to evaluate auditory function, including tests that present multiple stimuli and require the patient to differentiate specific items (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). While there is no single, widely accepted diagnostic tool or known cause for CAPD, researchers continue to refine their understanding of this complex condition through ongoing research and testing.",
            "Deception may be an effective tool for achieving short-term goals, but it can also lead to long-term consequences. In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, the character's reliance on disguise ultimately forces them to confront the tension between self-preservation and relationships with others. The process of shedding a false identity can be complicated by the risk of alienation, as those who have been deceived may not take kindly to the revelation. This dichotomy is particularly pronounced in situations where deception involves a reversal of gender roles.\n\nOne of the most vexing aspects of this phenomenon is the underlying motivation behind the adoption of a disguise. In the case of Viola, her decision to pose as a man is driven by a desire for self-protection in an unfamiliar environment. As she navigates her new circumstances, Viola's disguise allows her to establish a sense of control, but it also creates a sense of disconnection from her female peers. This isolation is further complicated by the mistaken assumption of Olivia, who falls in love with the object of her affection under the assumption that he is a man. Meanwhile, Viola must also contend with the unrequited romantic feelings she develops for Orsino.\n\nOn one level, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on the power of deception to uncover suppressed emotions. The characters' responses to Viola/Cesario's presence suggest that they are forced to confront their own desires and biases. For instance, Olivia's shifting affections from Cesario to Sebastian raise questions about the nature of her attraction to the character. Is she drawn to Cesario's male persona, or does she harbor feelings for women? While it is unlikely that Shakespeare intended to portray Olivia as a closeted individual, her character can be seen as a satirical representation of the societal norms of the time, which often judged people based on surface-level appearances.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by Olivia's ease in transitioning from romantic interest to familial affection for Viola, highlighting the fluidity of her character's emotions and her tendency to prioritize social appearances over genuine connections.",
            "The German colonial regime has been characterized by a complex and often brutal nature, as exemplified by the devastating treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, it is essential to acknowledge that no colonial empire can be reduced to a single descriptor, as the German colonial administration exhibited varying policies and approaches across its territories. Similarly, educational initiatives in the colonies were diverse, ranging from established state schools to missionary-led institutions. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a substantial population of African residents with a high level of literacy and education.\n\nIn contrast, German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a starkly different picture. Unlike East Africa, where the government actively promoted education through state-run institutions, the responsibility for educating the native population in South West Africa was largely delegated to missionary organizations that received limited government support. The administration did, however, invest considerable resources in European education, establishing a network of state schools and providing significant backing for missionary-led institutions. These educational policies had long-lasting effects on South West Africa's development, even after the end of German rule. Unfortunately, the outcomes were far from uniform, with the majority of the population in South West Africa remaining largely uneducated and illiterate. Various socio-economic and political factors contributed to this disparate experience, and this paper aims to further explore these factors by examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial officials towards native Africans.\n\nA substantial body of literature exists on education within the German colonial empire, with a significant portion written in German and published in the early 20th century. These early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems in place within the colonies. Later English-language studies expanded the discourse by conducting comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and delving deeper into specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in educational systems between colonies. Cohen's comprehensive study of education in South West Africa and East Africa provides valuable insights into the divergent educational approaches employed in these regions. Cohen attributes many of the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to the presence of a substantial settler population.\n\nGeographical conditions in South West Africa were relatively favorable, with a moderately temperate climate and arid desert regions. The European population of the territory reflected this relatively hospitable environment, with around 15,000 settlers residing in South West Africa by 1913, in contrast to the approximately 5,336 settlers in East Africa, which had the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has resulted in a rich tapestry of diverse genres, each with its own unique characteristics and sub-genres. Heavy metal, a genre that has emerged over the past 40 years, stands out for its remarkable adaptability and emotional depth. By embracing its darker aspects, metal has carved out a distinct niche for itself within the music landscape. This trajectory is a testament to the genre's ability to evolve and incorporate elements from other styles, resulting in a diverse array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres.\n\nThe heavy metal movement has become increasingly complex, with numerous sub-niches and influences from various genres. To fully appreciate the breadth of metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the factors that have shaped its development. At its core, metal is a genre characterized by its intensity, often manifesting as a \"music of excess\" - louder, faster, and more complex than its predecessors. Skilled musicianship is a defining feature of metal, with many artists pushing the boundaries of technical proficiency.\n\nThe genre's association with substance use is also a notable aspect of its history. The mid-1970s saw a surge in psychedelic drug use, which influenced the creation of some of the most innovative and experimental metal records. This period's emphasis on darker, more visceral qualities resonated with listeners who were seeking a more authentic expression of the human experience. Later generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's emphasis on intense emotions and brooding introspection, further enriching the genre's sonic landscape. The following lyrics from Helter Skelter, a song often cited as one of the earliest heavy metal tracks, illustrate the genre's affinity for exploring the darker aspects of the human experience:\n\nThis thought-provoking song, penned by the Beatles, showcases the band's ability to craft a heavy, emotive sound that resonated with the times. Released on the iconic White Album, Helter Skelter was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier offerings, demonstrating the Beatles' desire to push the boundaries of their music and assert their own unique style.",
            "In the years preceding the Surrealist movement, a lesser-known figure, Henri Rousseau, was striving for artistic expression that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy. His 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, not only captures the wonder of a woman immersed in a dreamlike world but also embodies Rousseau's own personal aspirations and internal conflicts. Having long coveted recognition from his peers and the art world, Rousseau found himself caught between the desire to conform to established styles and the longing to forge his own unique path. This dichotomy is poignantly reflected in The Dream, a work that encapsulates the artist's lifelong struggle to reconcile the need for validation with the urge to innovate.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream in this context, it is essential to delve into Rousseau's life story. Born in 1844 in the French town of Laval, he hailed from a family of modest means, with his father working as a successful merchant. Despite the absence of formal artistic training, Rousseau's life took a dramatic turn when he lost his young wife and several children, leaving him with a deep sense of sorrow and a yearning for a fresh start. Painting became his solace and a means to reinvent himself. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasantry, Rousseau's work is characterized by a more grounded, folkloric sensibility, reflecting the hopes and aspirations of the common man.\n\nRousseau's quest for acceptance by the art world is understandable, given his late start in life and the presence of more established artists, including Henri Matisse, who was gaining recognition during the same period. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, while both artists operated in the same sphere, their motivations and styles diverged significantly. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to create works that were conventionally appealing, hoping to be acknowledged by the Artiste Français.",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has long fascinated scholars, who often cite a deep-seated connection between truth and beauty. This notion is not merely a product of philosophical speculation, but rather a profound observation grounded in human experience. As John Keats astutely noted in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty – That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While our understanding of the world is shaped by education and experience, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics often defies conventional instruction. Both endeavors seek to describe, rather than prescribe, and our studies of morality and beauty aim to elucidate the underlying reasons behind the beauty of a piece of art or literature, or the moral implications of an action.\n\nOne notable aspect of this connection is the inherent difficulty in capturing the essence of what is good or beautiful through critical analysis. When evaluating a work of art, such as da Vinci's Mona Lisa, we may focus on elements like composition, context, and cultural significance, but these factors ultimately fall short of explaining why the piece is considered great. Instead, our descriptions of art and literature often begin with a vague yet intuitive sense of recognition, as in the phrase, \"There's just something about it.\" This \"something\" is precisely what eludes complete description, and it is this transcendent quality that underlies the power of art and morality.\n\nFlannery O'Connor's observation that a story can convey something that cannot be expressed in other ways reinforces this notion. Similarly, Wittgenstein's statement that ethics cannot be fully expressed and is instead transcendental underscores its elusive nature. This je ne sais quoi, this intangible yet essential quality, is the common thread that weaves ethics and aesthetics together.\n\nThe intersection of ethics and aesthetics is further complicated by the fact that both impact us on a fundamental, noumenal level, to use a Kantian term. Our experiences of beauty and morality are ineffable, existing beyond the realm of rational explanation. This connection is particularly pronounced in literature, which, as McKean notes, is distinguished by its unique moral quality. Literature's ability to convey values and inspire reflection makes it a vital part of our shared human experience.",
            "Germany, a nation boasting a distinct cultural identity, is a testament to the rich tapestry of influences that have woven together its history. The country's unique blend of traditions can be observed in various cities, from the southwestern town of Munich nestled at the foot of the Alps to the northern port city of Kiel, situated on the Baltic Sea. Similarly, the Rhine River city of Cologne and the Saxon city of Dresden, located on the Elbe River, both reflect this cultural diversity.\n\nGermany's complex heritage stems from its diverse origins, shaped by various tribes and influences. The term \"Germania\" refers to the ancestral homeland of the German people. The etymology of this name is a subject of ongoing debate among scholars, with multiple theories emerging.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, the name \"Germania\" may have originated from the Tungrian tribe mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus in his work \"Germania\" written in 98 AD. Another theory suggests that Julius Caesar derived the term from the Gauls, using it to distinguish between conquered and unconquered territories in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War). Caesar noted in the first book of his work, \"The Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they are continually waging war... They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.\"\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus further elaborated on the origins of the Germans in his \"De Origine et situ Germanorum\" (On the Origin and Situation of the Germans), written around 98 AD. He described the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external migrations or intermarriage. The Romans, Tacitus wrote, would not have voluntarily emigrated to Germany due to its harsh climate, geography, and unyielding culture.\n\nDuring the 1st century AD, Germanic tribes began to interact with the Roman Empire, primarily through trade and military service. They would often trade goods obtained from their homeland and offer their battle-hardened skills to the Roman army in exchange for stable opportunities within the Roman Empire. This initial contact laid the groundwork for a complex and dynamic relationship between the Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire, which would eventually shape the course of European history.",
            "As I gazed downward, my mind was a blank slate, absorbing the scene before me without attachment. My thoughts flowed in and out with the pace of a gentle stream, never lingering long enough to form a cohesive idea. My mind functioned with a smooth efficiency, allowing me to experience the world around me without the burden of personal interpretation. \n\nIt was during this period that I came across a book, 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,' which offered a unique perspective on the creative process. I had long been fascinated by art, a fascination that began when I was a young child. The book provided a comprehensive guide to understanding art, from the basic tools to the cognitive processes that underlie our perception of visual information. One technique that resonated with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying complex compositions and allowing for a more nuanced understanding of form and structure. \n\nAs I stood before my subject, however, I found myself unable to apply this technique. The scene before me was overwhelming, and I felt a sense of awe wash over me. I thought of the great masters – Picasso's blue period, Monet's affinity for greenery, the Renaissance masters' use of color – and I felt a sense of trepidation. Could I, on my own, create something worthy of the title 'artistic'? \n\nWith a deep breath, I reached for my tool of choice and began to create. My hand moved with a subtle intensity, my muscles flexing as I brought my vision to life. Water flowed, serene and calm. My hand clenched and released, the motion growing more urgent with each passing moment. My hand struck the handle of the toilet, but the stubborn mass refused to budge. \n\nI stood there, mop in hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, my tie knotted uncomfortably around my neck. I surveyed the scene before me, a mess of processed matter left behind by someone else. The air was heavy with the stench of neglect. I stood there, lost in thought, as I pondered the nature of my surroundings. \n\nIt was then that I decided to take action. With a deep breath, I gripped the end of the toilet paper roll and began to twist it into a makeshift mitten. I stood up straight, then bent at the waist, my hand dipping slowly into the bowl with the deliberation of a chef preparing a meal. The motion was almost meditative, a moment of calm in the midst of chaos.",
            "A disturbing trend is unfolding on American roads: the alarming number of teenage fatalities attributed to vehicular accidents. Several key factors contribute to this epidemic, and research from the National Institutes of Health sheds light on the brain's unpreparedness for the risks associated with driving. Moreover, inexperience plays a significant role, leading to higher rates of accidents, rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents. Studies have shown that when teenagers drive with their peers, the risks escalate, as exemplified by a study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center.\n\nIn response, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict the number of hours teens can drive and prohibit minor passengers. However, these measures, in my opinion, serve only as temporary solutions. The underlying issue lies in the fact that, statistically speaking, the youngest drivers are disproportionately vulnerable to the perils of driving. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that a significant proportion of individuals under the age of 19-20 exhibit a predilection for risk-taking due to thrill-seeking tendencies. This finding underscores the need to delay licensing until such tendencies have begun to subside.\n\nConsidering this information, it is reasonable to reevaluate the current licensing system. One potential approach involves increasing the minimum age for obtaining a standard driver's license to 18 or older. This could be achieved by providing driver's education classes in schools and maintaining provisional permits prior to full licensure. A uniform national standard could be established, based on existing state requirements, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult. By adopting a uniform national policy, we can reduce the staggering number of teen driver fatalities and ensure a safer driving environment across the country.\n\nThe proposed legislation is not a groundbreaking concept; rather, it is a sensible solution grounded in empirical evidence and research. By taking a proactive approach to addressing this issue, we can safeguard the lives of countless teenagers and prevent what could be a catastrophic increase in traffic accidents in the coming years, particularly as the Baby Boomer generation's children reach driving age and join the roads in large numbers by 2010.",
            "In my exploration of the Library of Congress's repository of early Edison films, I chose to examine the collection of trick films from 1895 to 1901. There were fifteen films in total, most of which utilized clever editing techniques to create the illusion of something extraordinary. My focus was on deciphering the underlying structures that governed these trick films and identifying the anomalies that emerged in later examples. \n\nGenerally speaking, the early trick films were rooted in a specific aesthetic: they were composed within a fixed, frontal frame, characterized by stationary camera work, and adhered to a strict narrative structure. This involved long and medium shots, and a clear separation between each individual concept or event. However, some films from the early 20th century began to deviate from this model by incorporating more complex narrative techniques.\n\nOne of the defining features of the trick films was their consistent use of an interior set within a frontal frame. The camera remained stationary, never moving to follow actors or objects within the scene. This compositional style drew inspiration from the theatrical tradition, where it was commonly used in stage and vaudeville performances, as well as in magic shows. As a result, the actors in these films tended to move only horizontally, never approaching or receding from the camera. \n\nThe film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) exemplifies this characteristic, where characters enter from the right-hand side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even when they exit the frame, the camera remains stationary, not following them.\n\nGiven the frontal composition style, shots in these films predominantly consisted of long shots and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were never used, and this was likely due to the influence of theatre and vaudeville, where the entire performance was visible within the frame of the stage. In line with this tradition, actors rarely, if ever, moved towards the camera, making close-ups impossible.\n\nMost early trick films adhered to a narrative structure that equated one conceptual shot with a single physical shot. This limited the length of these films to a minute or less, depending on the frame rate used. Consequently, the trick films tended to focus on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing acts, and quick-switching sequences. However, a closer examination often reveals that a single conceptual shot can actually be composed of several joined shots, aimed at creating an illusion of apparition or disappearance. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, is a prime example. A detailed analysis reveals the exact moment where the physical shot containing Mary's \"decapitated\" head begins, even though the entire film is conceptually a single shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a stalwart advocate of the virtues inherent to Republicanism, driven by a profound dedication to the principles of individual liberty and limitations on government power. As an agriculturalist by trade, his profession and brief foray into politics instilled in him a stalwart commitment to upholding the values of a self-sufficient agrarian system. This foundational perspective shaped his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution, and the judicial system, as he sought to preserve and promote the integrity of what he deemed the most honorable of occupations.\n\nTaylor believed that the nascent United States presented an unparalleled opportunity to forge an exemplary system of governance, unencumbered by the constraints of established tradition. He firmly believed in the inherent, interconnected nature of human rights, positing that the deprivation of one right would compromise the integrity of all, and thus, these rights should remain beyond the reach of government interference. He posited that the notion of a \"state of nature\" suggested that those with physical prowess and cunning would dominate, but that in a civilized society, this hierarchy must not prevail.\n\nTo create a society that balances the inherent duality of human nature – comprising both good and evil – Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledges and accommodates these complexities. He adhered to a rigorous moral dichotomy, stating that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined good principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agricultural prosperity, and regulate capitalism, and believed that a government founded on these principles would operate equitably, regardless of its administration, which would inevitably be influenced by avarice and self-interest. Taylor posited that self-interest, while a fundamental driver of human behavior, becomes malevolent when it prioritizes the interests of sub-groups over the common good. A well-designed government was necessary to harness man's innate propensity for evil, while vigilantly monitoring its own actions to prevent the introduction of destructive principles.\n\nLike many ardent Republicans of his time, Taylor championed a strict, literal interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited Federal government with powers explicitly enumerated in the document. He recognized that an expansive Federal government would be costly and potentially despotic, yet cautioned that a simplistic, literal approach could lead to corruption. Furthermore, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly characterized the country as a confederation of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon reviewing the data presented in Figure 17, a noticeable decrease in commuter log submissions became apparent during the third month of the project. This decline was somewhat concerning, and pinpointing the exact cause proved challenging. Several factors likely contributed to this decrease. The onset of winter at a New England campus typically leads to a decline in bicycle and pedestrian commutes, which may account for some of the drop. Additionally, the end of the fall semester coincided with the month of December, a time when students and faculty are usually preoccupied with schoolwork, grading, and other academic obligations, potentially pushing the commuter log to the backburner. Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, accompanied by a month-long break for students and faculty, resulting in a decrease in campus attendance.\n\nThe subsequent resumption of classes in late January may have also played a role in the low number of log submissions for that month. It is also possible that the natural enthusiasm for a new project may wane over time, leading to decreased participation. To combat this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign that aimed to revitalize the initiative. This effort resulted in an increase in log submissions for that month, indicating that targeted interventions can indeed help reinvigorate the project.\n\nAnother challenge we faced was the entrenched cultural preference for driving personal vehicles, which can make it difficult to encourage alternative modes of commuting. To mitigate this, we offered prizes in the form of gift cards to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores. While these incentives were effective, it would be interesting to explore the impact of more substantial rewards, such as offering bicycles, hybrid cars, or electric vehicles. This could have helped to counteract the decline in engagement observed during the project. The value of the prizes remained constant throughout the project, and it is possible that increasing the rewards over time may have had a more significant impact. For instance, announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles and hybrid cars, in December and January, respectively, may have sustained participation levels.",
            "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument that tracks a specific index, commodity, or a diverse portfolio of assets similar to an index fund, but offers greater flexibility and trades on an exchange like individual stocks. This hybrid vehicle combines the diversification benefits of an index fund with the advantages of single stock ownership, including the ability to engage in short sales, margin purchases, and transactions as low as a single share. While these perks are highly appealing, the expense ratios of ETFs are notably lower than those of the average mutual fund. However, investors should be aware that trading ETFs involves paying a commission, similar to buying individual stocks. Furthermore, the availability of a wide range of ETFs allows investors to select from various investment options.\n\nA case in point is the ETF IHF, which warrants closer examination. To determine whether owning a single ETF can replicate the benefits of a diversified portfolio and whether there are more optimal configurations of the constituent stocks, we will compare the top 10 holdings of the ETF IHF to the top 10 stocks in the underlying index. This exercise will provide valuable insights into the representativeness of the top 10 holdings and their potential to deliver superior returns and reduced risk.\n\nTo streamline the analysis, we have focused on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. Below is the breakdown of the top 10 holdings along with their respective percentages.\n\nTo gauge the effectiveness of the top 10 holdings in representing the ETF IHF, we have calculated their individual contributions to the Beta and Return of a hypothetical portfolio consisting of these stocks, weighted according to their holdings in the ETF. The results are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nA noteworthy observation from the chart is that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would have yielded a 6.11% higher return compared to the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of the top 10 holdings is 0.12 lower than the ETF, indicating a lower level of risk. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting of the top 10 holdings could provide higher returns with reduced volatility. However, it is essential to determine whether these results are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we have calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, to compare their collective volatility to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's \"Dream-Land\" is often cited as a standout work among his oeuvre. Notably, the term \"Thulé\" appears in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott's research, this word has its origins in Virgil, who used it to describe a mythical island situated north of Britain, marking the edge of the known world in ancient Greek geography. However, a more contemporary source also merits consideration. Poe was known for his fascination with German literature.\n\nThis connection to Virgil's work is significant because it highlights Poe's literary influences, which extend beyond his American contemporaries. As Keith Sagar notes in his study of Poe's connection to European literature, the American poet was deeply interested in the works of German authors, including Goethe. Karl J. Arndt's book, \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" explores the similarities between Poe's \"Politian\" and Goethe's \"Mignon,\" suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from Goethe's work.\n\nA 19th-century literary encyclopedia, \"The Oxford Companion to English Literature,\" provides insight into Goethe's literary career. Goethe was a celebrated writer of poetic drama, particularly in his epic \"Faust,\" which was published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his passing. Within the second part of \"Faust,\" there is a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This poem tells the story of a king whose wife gives him a goblet, only to pass away soon after. The king's grief is so intense that he becomes a recluse, drinking heavily and eventually decides to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the speaker in \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Both characters grapple with loss and find solace in drinking. This connection may suggest that Goethe's work influenced Poe's writing, particularly in his use of similar narrative motifs. Furthermore, Goethe's \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just a year before Poe referenced Thulé in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references Thulé twice in his collected works, using it as a bookend in \"Dream-Land\" and in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" The poem \"Dream-Land\" can be seen as a companion piece to Goethe's \"The King of Thulé.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape of Thulé, characterized by darkness, loneliness, and a world drained of color. These themes are eerily reminiscent of the King of Thulé, who is also grappling with loss and isolation.\n\nGiven Poe's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, it is likely that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work. Tennyson's own writing style and themes may have contributed to Poe's interest in the German author. Moreover, the widespread reproduction and translation of Goethe's works in the 19th century would have made his writing accessible to a broader audience, including Poe.",
            "In California, a shopper who suffered an injury after slipping on an applesauce spill at a grocery store might potentially receive punitive damages if they can show that the store manager acted with a reckless disregard for the potential harm caused by allowing the spill to remain uncleaned. A court would be unlikely to dismiss out of hand the claim for punitive damages made by Jennifer Palmer, who slipped and fell on the spill at D&D Markets. To justify an award of punitive damages, Palmer would need to present evidence that the store manager's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for the potential harm that could result from allowing the spill to remain uncleaned. \n\nThe fact that Martin, the store manager, knew of the spill twice, at 5:00 pm and 5:15 pm, but failed to address it due to his dinner break, provides a strong basis for Palmer's argument. Furthermore, the store had experienced five slip-and-fall incidents prior to Palmer's accident, which suggests that Martin was aware of the potential hazards and should have taken steps to mitigate them. While it is debatable whether the manager's actions were malicious, the fact that the store had experienced multiple incidents in 2009 and failed to take adequate measures to maintain store safety weighs in Palmer's favor.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee informed Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle, but Martin declined to address it, citing his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee reported the spill to Martin, but he still failed to take action. It was not until 30 minutes later that the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Palmer is now suing D&D for both compensatory and punitive damages, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, punitive damages can be awarded for a breach of obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The California Civil Code defines malice as conduct that is intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have found malice when a defendant was aware of the probable consequences of their actions and willfully failed to avoid those consequences, demonstrating a reckless disregard for the safety of others.",
            "It has been four years since I had the opportunity to take a course in Islamic studies at my alma mater.  A recurring theme in that class was the debated notion of whether Islam is inherently a hostile faith.  This question remains increasingly pertinent today, particularly in light of the significant shifts in media portrayals of Islam and extremism over the past two decades.  The prospect of a presidential candidate with a Muslim background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unthinkable in the early 2000s.  In examining the life of the Prophet Muhammad, I've come to realize that the portrayal in his biography diverges from the common perception of his character.  Initially, I associated Muhammad with coercive tactics, forcing non-Muslims to convert to Islam through conquest.  However, the biography presents a more nuanced image of Muhammad as a misunderstood figure who conveyed his message through humility and compassion, drawing followers through personal encounter rather than coercion.\n\nI've also observed intriguing parallels between the lives and teachings of Jesus and Muhammad.  One example that stands out is the account of Muhammad multiply bread and milk to feed a group of forty men.  This narrative style, which emphasizes Muhammad's humility and lack of need for demonstration, has led me to wonder whether the intention was to downplay the significance of Jesus' miracles and teachings.  This perceived attempt to equate Muhammad's story with that of Jesus raises questions about the legitimacy of such a comparison.\n\nFurthermore, I've noticed that the biography often relies on secondary accounts of events, which can undermine the credibility of the narrative.  While the authors' intention may have been to provide testament to the truth of the stories, this approach can also create skepticism and raise suspicions about the validity of the information.  What bothers me most about this work, however, is its attempt to elevate Muhammad to a level of moral perfection, portraying him as wise, gentle, and endearing.  Historical records, however, suggest a more complex picture of Muhammad's rise to power, and I often wonder whether modern Muslims are aware of the historical context surrounding his life.",
            "Throughout the history of Christianity, the principles laid down by Jesus during his lifetime have gradually become lost in the development of the faith.  If we examine the trajectory of Christian thought, a pattern emerges of increasing divergence from its foundational roots.  Today, we are witnessing a heightened awareness and a progressive shift in societal attitudes.  While traditionalists may resist any departures from established doctrine, their influence is unlikely to dictate the broader trajectory of the faith.  In the years to come, Christians are likely to exhibit a growing interest in uncovering the authentic essence of their faith, distinguishing the original teachings of Jesus from the subsequent additions and interpretations that have accumulated over time.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but ultimately, it will eventuate in a significant reversal of the dominant trend in Christian history.  A movement will emerge, steadily stripping away layers of doctrine, much like a hands of time moving in reverse, until only the core principles of Jesus' message remain.  When this trend gains momentum in the United States and Europe, it will likely lead to a widespread shift towards a more fundamental understanding of the faith, with adherents reverting to a more pristine, authentic expression of the Christian vision.  The established church will continue to play a crucial role in guiding this process, albeit with a perspective shaped by a more streamlined, unified understanding of the faith.  As a result, the current diversity within Christianity will give way to a greater uniformity of belief and practice.  Instead of a multiplicity of perspectives and traditions, we will witness a growing convergence of views and practices across regions, denominations, and other divisions.  Historical precedents illustrate that such reversals can occur; for instance, the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually became a Christian-dominated institution.  Similarly, the United States has undergone significant transformations, moving from a society that once marginalized African-Americans to one that has elevated them to positions of leadership.  A comparable reversal is on the horizon for the Christian faith, as adherents seek to return to the fundamental sources of their beliefs.  To facilitate this process, a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' teachings will be necessary, one that interprets his words as rich in metaphor and symbolism, rather than taken at face value.  By examining the historical precedents, we can distill the essence of the original faith, tracing its roots back to its earliest manifestations in Judaism.  In the centuries preceding the Roman conquest of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Jewish thought was characterized by a deep commitment to monotheism, the revelatory nature of scripture, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  However, the Jewish community was not monolithic, comprising various factions such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the broader populace.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" by Upton Sinclair offers a scathing critique of human nature, revealing a pervasive tendency towards self-interest and a lack of consideration for others. Sinclair masterfully portrays the corrupting influence of unchecked economic ambition, exemplified by the factory owners and managers who prioritize profit over people and the environment. The author's vivid descriptions of the industrial landscape, such as \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\", underscore the devastating consequences of their actions.\n\nThe factory owners and managers display a callous disregard for the welfare of their employees and the surrounding ecosystem. They are willing to sacrifice the health and well-being of their workers in pursuit of economic gain, as Sinclair illustrates through the phrase \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". The absence of labor protections during the time period allowed these individuals to exploit their workers, forcing them to work excessively long hours in hazardous conditions without adequate compensation or support.\n\nThe novel suggests that the workers in Packingtown were effectively trapped in a system that prioritized profit over people. The lack of accessible resources and support mechanisms left them vulnerable to exploitation, with unions often serving only to further enrich themselves at the expense of the workers. Sinclair's description of the working class as a \"population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\" serves as a stark reminder of the dehumanizing effects of unchecked capitalism.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully employs various literary techniques to elicit a specific emotional response from his readers in The Great Gatsby. Effective use of these techniques varies among authors, and Fitzgerald is no exception. One striking method he employs is juxtaposing seemingly incongruous adjectives with nouns to create a distinct atmosphere. He also skillfully assigns symbolic meanings to objects and later leverages these connotations to convey deeper significance.\n\nIn The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald employs the technique of imbuing colors with meaning, most notably white and gray. These colors are not merely descriptive elements, but serve as potent symbols that evoke a particular sentiment. The meanings attached to these colors are expertly woven throughout the novel, eventually manifesting in the reader's perception of pivotal objects. The dichotomy of white and gray is initially established as a representative of refinement and uniformity, respectively.\n\nThe former connotes an air of elegance and sophistication, while the latter suggests wear and age. This binary is consistently reinforced throughout the novel's commencement. The affluent characters, such as Daisy and Jordan, are frequently associated with white attire, as exemplified by Nick's \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party and Tom's \"white shirt\" during his encounter with Myrtle. Conversely, the presence of gray is often linked to the mundane and the ordinary, like the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable or the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" in the valley of ashes.\n\nAs the narrative progresses, Fitzgerald skillfully subverts these initial associations, using white and gray to signify the lack of significance or uniformity in certain subjects. This process begins with Daisy, who is initially introduced as a vibrant and dynamic character. However, after a prolonged absence of these colors, her reappearance in a \"little white roadster\" subtly undermines her individuality, reducing her to a uniform and coveted object in Gatsby's eyes. This technique is repeated throughout the novel, as Fitzgerald employs white and gray to convey a sense of uniformity and lack of distinction in various characters and settings.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural sector, driven by its favorable climate and ample sunlight. The region's fertile landscape allows for a diverse range of crops to flourish, including fresh produce such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, and an assortment of herbs. Berries, peaches, lemons, and other tree fruits are also cultivated in the area. The local demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial, with many organizations operating lengthy waiting lists for their produce. Organic dairy products, including eggs and milk, are also highly sought after. Furthermore, several local farms offer guided tours, allowing visitors to explore the agricultural processes and enjoy activities like hiking, birdwatching, and other outdoor pursuits. This model of sustainable agriculture not only enables landowners to tap into government incentives but also fosters a healthier environment, opening opportunities for recreational use, educational programs, and revenue generation.\n\nThe benefits of organic farming extend beyond economic gains. A notable advantage is the promotion of biodiversity in both plant and animal life, as a result of the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. Conversely, organic farming presents some challenges, including increased labor requirements for pest and weed management, soil fertilization, and the potential for higher losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often lack the efficiency and economies of scale associated with larger operations. Other environmentally beneficial practices, such as cover cropping, strategic grazing, and invasive species removal, may also incur higher labor costs. Therefore, a landowner seeking to balance profitability with environmental stewardship may necessitate seeking financial assistance or expert guidance.\n\nThe hypothetical property in question is situated in unincorporated San Diego County, adjacent to the town of Potrero, California. The 160-acre parcel consists of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the land is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and California gnatcatcher. The area has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries and later settled by cattle ranchers and woodcutters in the late 19th century. This specific property was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nFor this project, I selected a piece of property from a real estate website and researched government programs to identify potential cost-saving measures and strategies for maintaining wildlife-friendly agricultural practices. I drew inspiration from an existing organic farm in the same region as a model for this hypothetical scenario.",
            "The role of cultural nuances in the negotiation process cannot be overstated. Cultural identity is a multifaceted entity that encompasses both what it represents and what it does not. It resists simplistic categorization, defying labels such as \"uniform\" or \"singular.\" The notion that an entire nation or organization can be reduced to a single trait, like \"the stubbornness of Russians\" or \"the accommodating nature of the Japanese,\" is a gross oversimplification. While a general understanding of cultural tendencies can be beneficial, it is more productive to focus on the specific cultural dynamics that will impact the negotiation. By doing so, one can develop a more nuanced appreciation for how cultural attitudes will shape the conversation.\n\nFamiliarizing oneself with a foreign culture or perspective involves a range of approaches, from studying its history and evolution to acknowledging its biases and preconceptions. Rather than attempting to alter or judge a culture, it is essential to accept and work within its boundaries, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where a weaker bargaining position may be at play. When operating in unfamiliar territory, demonstrating respect for local customs and traditions can facilitate smoother communication and help break down cultural barriers.\n\nIt is also worth noting that cultural identity is not solely defined by national or international affiliations. Companies within a given nation can develop their unique corporate cultures, which may prioritize work-life balance, efficiency, or community engagement. These corporate cultures can be reflected in various aspects, such as employee dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, there is significant diversity in corporate culture, with notable variations between companies and regions. This highlights the importance of examining the complexities within a culture, rather than relying on surface-level generalizations.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying values of a culture is crucial, as they provide the foundation for its behavior and decision-making. For instance, in cultures where saving face or maintaining harmony is valued, a negotiator may be hesitant to publicly criticize their organization or superior. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize a strong work ethic, a negotiator may be more inclined to push for a hard bargain. By considering these cultural subtleties, a negotiator can better navigate the negotiation process and build a more effective relationship with their counterpart. Ultimately, learning about the personal values and perspectives of one's opponent can be invaluable in achieving a successful outcome.",
            "The notion that the absence of a higher authority is a notion that has been entertained by philosophers and theologians across various eras. The biblical passage found in Psalm 14, attributed to the Christian tradition, serves as a foundational text in the philosophical discourse on the existence of God. This idea is also central to the philosophical arguments of Thomas Aquinas, a medieval scholar whose works will be the subject of our examination alongside those of St. Anselm. To facilitate a comparative analysis, we will assume that both thinkers subscribe to a monotheistic worldview, specifically one grounded in the biblical narrative. A more nuanced understanding of their arguments would be compromised by assuming a more abstract or pantheistic notion of the divine. \n\nOur analysis suggests that while both thinkers present compelling arguments, neither provides a definitive basis for believing in the existence of a higher power. To demonstrate this, we will first examine the philosophical framework presented by St. Anselm. Anselm's argument posits that the existence of God can be inferred through introspection and rational inquiry. He contends that the concept of God's nonexistence is inherently self-contradictory, and therefore, can be excluded from consideration. This perspective implies that the evidence for God's existence can be found within the realm of human consciousness, rendering external evidence unnecessary. This perspective is reflective of the Christian emphasis on faith as a foundation for belief.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas presents a more empirically grounded argument for the existence of God. He suggests that reason and evidence can provide a conclusive proof of God's existence, eliminating the need for faith. This approach has significant implications for evangelism and the dissemination of religious ideas, as it allows for the persuasion of new converts through logical reasoning rather than reliance on unverifiable assertions. Aquinas develops five distinct arguments for the existence of God, each of which relies on the logical necessity of a higher power. These arguments include the concepts of change, causality, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony, demonstrating that the existence of God can be inferred through the analysis of observable phenomena and logical deduction.",
            "A significant figure, destined to be called the Buddha, emerged in the 5th or 6th century BCE. Over time, he abandoned worldly life and achieved enlightenment, setting in motion a legacy that has endured for approximately 2,500 years. The resultant philosophy, Buddhism, has undergone notable transformations, especially within the Theravada tradition, which is widely regarded as its most authentic expression. The evolution of this ancient faith is exemplified in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony has become an integral part of the cultural landscape. Although this celebration is not directly referenced in the Buddha's teachings, it highlights the divergences between past and present, encompassing everything from superficial customs to the fundamental principles of the faith. As the Theravada community, encompassing both monastic and lay adherents, has navigated the passage of time, its doctrine has adapted to external and internal influences, ranging from hostile and benevolent forces.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, certain key terms will be employed. Internal forces are defined as those emanating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation, while external forces are those originating from non-Buddhists. Hostile forces are those that intentionally or unintentionally harm the Buddhist community, often motivated by negative perceptions of the faith. Conversely, benign forces neither aim to harm nor assist the community, although they may inadvertently have an impact. These definitions will be referenced frequently throughout this analysis.\n\nTo establish a foundation for further exploration, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents take refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the three baskets of Buddhist scripture: the Sutta Pitaka, which contains the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, which outlines the disciplinary guidelines; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, which addresses the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Key concepts within the latter include Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (the impermanence of all phenomena). Recognizing these principles is crucial for transcending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, which perpetuates itself continuously. Ultimately, enlightenment will also bring an end to lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes rules for lay and monastic adherents, including the five precepts for the laity (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in inappropriate conduct, and I shall not consume intoxicants) and a more extensive set of disciplinary guidelines for monks. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the concept of the four noble truths: Dukkha (the reality of suffering), the causal relationship between attachment and suffering, and the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "The complex and often contentious relationship between the United States and Mexico serves as a prime example of a longstanding rivalry between neighboring nations that spanned an impressive 57-year period, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The conflict reached a boiling point during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States emerge victorious and secure significant territorial gains, including Texas and the American Southwest, as a result of its military campaigns against Mexico. However, this was not an isolated incident, as numerous other clashes and disputes took place between the two nations, ultimately subsiding on the eve of World War I.\n\nThis rivalry was rooted in fundamental differences between the two nations, particularly with regards to religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). Similar dynamics can be observed in other nations sharing a common border, where the convergence of interests often leads to the formation of rival positions. The United States and Mexico are not unique in this regard, as David M. Pletcher (1977) notes that Mexico, along with Cuba, represent longstanding challenges to American foreign policy (p. 41). Their geographical proximity to the United States and historical rivalries have contributed to the perpetuation of tensions between the two nations, distinguishing them from other Latin American countries that have traditionally enjoyed more amicable relations with the United States.\n\nThe influence of religion played a significant role in fostering this divide, as Sally Frahm (2001) points out that \"in the 18th and 19th centuries, Americans were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy, whereas in the 20th century, their focus shifted to fascism and communism\" (p. 86). In this context, the ideological struggles between the United States and Mexico were, to a large extent, driven by differing religious preferences. The historical legacy of distrust between the English and Spanish further complicated the establishment of harmonious diplomatic relations between the two nations. As a result, the United States and Mexico inherited a legacy of mutual distrust from their colonial past, which significantly hindered the development of a more cooperative relationship.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) have documented 17 notable disputes between Mexico and the United States during the 57-year period of rivalry. The majority of these disputes centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory and other frontier problems. The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge that was eventually addressed through increased military presence on both sides of the border (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to dissipate as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the United States (p. 109) and eventually subsided as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the later part of the 19th century.",
            "It's been fifteen years since my life took an unexpected turn due to a health condition that caught me off guard. At the time, I was in my mid-forties and a nurse, having chosen my profession as a way to secure a stable future. Growing up, I often heard that no matter what, I could always rely on a steady income due to the demands of healthcare. However, my aspirations lay elsewhere - in the worlds of science and journalism, preferably a combination of both. \n\nThe reality hit hard: I was left unable to work, with limited savings and no financial security. To this day, I rely on disability benefits, and I've had to adapt to a life that's uncertain and often challenging. Despite the difficulties, I've come to appreciate the support of my loved ones and a handful of loyal friends. Their assistance has been a lifeline, and I've learned that even the strongest individuals can't navigate every obstacle alone.\n\nLife is unpredictable, and emergencies can arise without warning. No matter how prepared we think we are, there will always be situations that exceed our capacity to cope. I firmly believe that rather than placing all our faith in a single entity, we should focus on rebuilding community and fostering a culture of mutual support. By doing so, we can break down the myth of individualism and rediscover the values that truly made America great: compassion, cooperation, and a willingness to lend a helping hand.\n\nI'm not advocating for a complete reliance on the government. On the contrary, I think we'd be better off if Americans learned to trust and help one another. We should strive to be prepared, just as I have been - with a well-stocked emergency kit, a supply of essential items, and a basic understanding of self-sufficiency. If feasible, having a small garden or a wood stove can be a valuable asset. However, it's equally important to cultivate relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors. By doing so, we can build a stronger, more resilient community that's better equipped to face the unexpected challenges life throws our way.",
            "In exploring the intricacies of evolutionary processes, one cannot help but wonder: what drives organisms to evolve in the manner that they do? Are there underlying constraints that influence the trajectory of evolutionary change? Although D'Arcy Thompson penned in 1917 that the task of defining organic forms in mathematical terms was a distant dream for zoologists, this challenge remains a pressing concern today. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have seen its application in the field of mollusk skeletogenesis, with notable contributions from researchers such as Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur research delves into the realm of mathematical modeling, combining it with experimental studies to elucidate the mechanisms governing evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum. By leveraging X-radiographic images of Prunum species, we have identified quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters have been input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995), enabling us to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. Our findings are being integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a dynamic structure that traverses 360 degrees of spatial space over time. The successive coils of a shell are known as whorls, which appear to spiral around a central axis, or columella. This axis extends through the shell's central column, separating each whorl from the next by a continuous line, or suture. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, resulting in a complex arrangement of whorls. In most shells, the final whorl is the largest, or body whorl. The spire consists of all whorls except the last, with the apex representing the tip of the spire and the base being the opposite end. The aperture serves as the opening through which the animal emerges.\n\nShells can be observed from various vantage points, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. Typically, an apertural view is employed, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex oriented upward.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves initially viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the first suture. A dividing line is then drawn, and whorls are counted from this point, with estimates made to a quarter whorl.\n\nThe shell can be regarded as a series of apertures that traverse time and space as the animal grows and builds its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture through coordinates representing the center of each whorl's aperture and the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture, it is possible to chart the trajectory of the shell's development. This trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented, allowing for the manipulation of parameters and the modification of the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality has encountered a plateau over the past decade, despite notable advancements in other areas, such as water and sanitation, aligning with the country's Millennium Development Goals. However, the sluggish pace of improvement in child and maternal health remains a pressing concern, with a significant gap to bridge before the target goals of 2015 can be achieved. Several critical factors contributing to this stagnation will be examined below, underscoring the necessity of fortifying the healthcare system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in increasing the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% now meeting this benchmark. Notwithstanding this progress, the category still encompasses traditional birth attendants, such as midwives, who may not possess the requisite medical expertise to intervene in complicated pregnancies, thereby perpetuating high rates of maternal mortality due to hemorrhage. Consequently, the improvement in this metric may be misleading, and substantial work remains to be done. Furthermore, a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases among children under five treated by a healthcare professional is also a cause for concern, with incomplete data on postnatal care revealing persistently low rates nationwide.\n\nThe relatively low cesarean-section rate of 4% in Indonesia raises additional concerns, with the urban-rural disparity further exacerbating the issue. While the rate of cesarean sections stands at 7% in urban areas, it is only 2% in rural settings, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services across the country. Moreover, the significant 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles indicates that access to healthcare services is concentrated in urban areas, leaving the poor disproportionately disadvantaged due to out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn considering the next steps to improve neonatal and maternal care indicators, a fundamental question arises: how can Indonesia most effectively address the dearth of services? Specifically, should the country opt for targeted programmatic approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system, prioritizing comprehensive maternal and child care over piecemeal interventions? While programmatic approaches offer the allure of targeted objectives and swift results, they also harbor several drawbacks. For instance, investing heavily in one sector often comes at the expense of other areas, diverting resources and personnel to the more lucrative or high-profile initiatives, as evident in the case of HIV/AIDS and family planning. Moreover, the proliferation of parallel programs within a single sector can lead to duplication of services, inefficient coordination, and increased administrative burdens, including redundant forms, paperwork, and funding requirements.",
            "Victorian fiction is distinguished by its meticulousness and preoccupation with the upper echelons of society.  Two novels that diverge from this convention are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which instead incorporate elements of enigma and peculiarity.  By leveraging these unconventional narrative techniques, the authors create a sense of intrigue that propels the reader deeper into the interior lives of their characters, offering a more nuanced understanding of their motivations and emotional states.\n\nAs Dickens describes in Oliver Twist, the blend of reality and dream-like scenarios serves to heighten the sense of uncertainty and tension.  This is exemplified in the following passage: \"And now, a multitude of bewildering ideas crowded his mind; he seemed to still be walking alongside Sikes and Crackit, who were quarreling: the words they spoke echoed in his ears; and when he caught his attention, he found himself in conversation with them... He jerked back at the sound of gunfire; a chorus of cries and shouts filled the air, and lights danced before his eyes. The commotion subsided as suddenly as it began, leaving behind a vague, nagging sense of pain that gnawed at him relentlessly.\"\n\nThe two novels make use of dream sequences or dream-like states to achieve this effect, albeit in distinctly different ways. In Oliver Twist, these disorienting episodes often shed light on Oliver's inner turmoil, exposing his vulnerabilities and the depth of his emotional pain. When Oliver is forced to relive the shooting in Chapter 28, his vivid recollection is akin to a dream, as he desperately seeks assistance. The passage underscores Oliver's loss of control over the events unfolding around him, as well as his physical state, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting event overwhelms him, rendering him numb and disconnected from his surroundings; his despair is re-experienced, now infused with a sense of fear rather than shock. This sequence raises questions about the agency behind Oliver's misfortune, implying that it was not his own doing. Furthermore, it suggests that Oliver's growing sense of hopelessness is a testament to Fagin's influence, which has eroded his ability to react or take control of his fate.\n\nIn a subsequent passage from Wuthering Heights, the author writes: \"The day passed – it was more like night; the day was gone as soon as it began – and night fell once more; a long, oppressive silence, punctuated by fleeting moments.\"",
            "I worked in an after-school program about two years ago, where I provided academic support to elementary school students. My expertise lay in English and reading, but I was eager to assist students struggling in various subjects. One student, Adrian, was particularly memorable. He was a third or fourth grader who faced reading challenges. What struck me was the inconsistency in his reading abilities – he would accurately pronounce some letters but struggle with others. His proficiency in spoken English was impressive, but his reading difficulties were unrelated to language comprehension. His mother, whose native language was Spanish, communicated with me through limited Spanish, which I struggled to understand. The revelation that dawned on me was that Adrian's reading difficulties stemmed from unfamiliarity with the English alphabet.\n\nThis experience resonates with the broader issue of language barriers in education, particularly in California. It highlights that even fluent English speakers can struggle with reading, and assumptions about a student's language proficiency may be misleading. The solution for Adrian was straightforward: targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the issue is more complex. There is no single solution, and a combination of approaches is necessary.\n\nThe dual language system is a promising approach for students whose first language is not English. Research has shown that students in bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Critics argue that it's resource-intensive and may not benefit all students, but this is not necessarily true. Implementing dual language programs as the norm, rather than the exception, would benefit all students. To make this feasible, we could introduce bilingual support staff, rather than requiring all teachers to be bilingual. This could include tutors, aides, or other educational assistants who can provide targeted support to students with language barriers.",
            "The notion of a transcendent force greater than ourselves is ingrained in us from an early age, often through the teachings of our caregivers or the pursuit of self-discovery. Some people adhere to established spiritual frameworks, while others reject these concepts outright, convinced that our individual experiences encompass the entirety of existence. Our perception of spirituality is a dynamic, evolving process, as we navigate various value systems and philosophies in search of meaning. The desire for illumination in the darkness drives us forward, illuminating our path and casting aside the shadows.\n\nAs I sat with my father on our porch, the sound of rain pattering against the tin roof created a somber atmosphere. The gutters, overflowing with water, drowned the plants that lined the porch's edge. He gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of introspection and reminiscence. His physical appearance had changed – his frame had grown thinner, his clothes hung loosely on his body, and his hair had begun to recede. I felt a sense of isolation and trepidation, but couldn't bring myself to discuss my concerns about his deteriorating health, as acknowledging them would only make the reality more unbearable for both of us.\n\nWe sat together in silence, the only sound the raindrops hitting the roof. I inched my chair closer to his, and together we gazed out into the twilight, the rain creating a soothing melody. My father passed away that December, five days shy of my twenty-second birthday. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his life beyond the projected timeline, but at what cost, I couldn't rationalize. In the stillness of the night, I found myself questioning the existence of a higher power, wondering if it had ever truly listened to my pleas.\n\nI didn't attend his passing, unable to bear watching the life that shaped me slip away. Instead, I chose to remember my father through his accomplishments and the time we shared, rather than the circumstances of his departure. I knew him better than anyone else, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to witness his final moments. For three days, I remained in a state of emotional numbness, awaiting the news that would forever alter my life.\n\nThe phone remained silent, a stark reminder of the emptiness that had descended upon me.",
            "The label 'Gothic Novel' is a paradoxical term that encapsulates both the timeless and the novel, a dichotomy first noted by Ian Watt in his work, The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has been subject to various interpretations, ranging from criticism to praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth, while others see it as an exemplar of the 'terrible sublime' (Burke). The foundational 'Gothic Novel', Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the legacies of both ancient and modern romance to forge a new literary path. By merging venerable theatrical elements with the modern novel's capacity for introspection, Walpole created a unique blend, which he termed a 'Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre frequently incorporates references to medieval theatricality, architecture, and cultural heritage. Even at the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term 'gothic' was applied to a wide range of contexts, often carrying connotations of antiquity or unsophistication in comparison to the progress of modern society and literature. The fusion of the theatrical and the novelistic, with their respective emphasis on spectacle and psychological insight, has allowed the Gothic genre to endure, achieving a paradoxical state of obsolescence and renewal for readers separated from its original context.\n\nOne of the most significant aspects of the Gothic novel is its engagement with the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of chivalry, as a code of conduct for knights, is reinterpreted and reimagined in The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry holds a particular significance for Gothic writers, who saw it as a symbol of the noble knight, exemplifying virtues such as bravery, honor, and competence. However, they also perceived a decline from this ideal in their contemporary society, which led them to idealize and romanticize the 'gothic past' (hinting at the eventual evolution of Gothic into Romanticism). In Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, this nostalgia for a lost era is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits and is described as:\n\nFrederic's characterization is noteworthy for its traditional associations with the chivalric ideal. As a prince, he has experienced suffering, been marked by tragedy, and is believed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the 'gallant and courteous knight' is, of course, an exaggeration, which serves to introduce the Gothic trope of excess (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management encompasses the intricate network of processes that facilitate the movement of goods from raw materials to customers. This complex system was first conceptualized in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a renowned consultant. Oliver's work underscored the importance of orchestrating the various stages of supply chain management, from procurement to distribution, to satisfy customer needs in an efficient and timely manner. Six pivotal elements comprise the supply chain framework: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Skilled managers adeptly utilize these components to deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction is the foundational stage of the supply chain, laying the groundwork for the entire process. It involves determining the optimal production strategy, encompassing factors such as when, where, and how goods will be manufactured. Managers must conduct market research to gauge customer demand, which serves as a critical determinant in informing production decisions. By analyzing market trends and customer preferences, managers can determine the products to be manufactured, their quantities, and the most suitable production locations, taking into account factors like volume, quality, and customer satisfaction.\n\nIn a well-structured supply chain, production planning is closely intertwined with scheduling and maintenance. Managers must meticulously coordinate workloads and maintenance tasks to ensure seamless operations. The slightest misstep can lead to substantial time and financial losses in the long run. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have implemented comprehensive design guidelines, inclusive of detailed protocols for uniform design, receiving shipments, and other operational aspects. This structured approach enables smooth execution and minimizes confusion among employees.\n\nThe second key element in supply chain management is supply, which involves making strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Companies may have multiple divisions for producing a single product, each equipped with distinct equipment, personnel, and specialized skills. Managers must select the most suitable division for each process and consider outsourcing work to other companies to enhance velocity – the ability to provide high-quality products while maintaining cost-effectiveness.",
            "A shocking claim is emblazoned on a makeshift sign, held aloft by the actress Ellen Page on a city street. The stark message, scrawled in bold letters, appears to suggest that a certain historical figure is alive and residing in a country shrouded in controversy. Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been under the iron-fisted rule of a military junta since 1962, following a coup that seized power from its democratically elected government. In 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, led by a large contingent of Buddhist monks. Dubbed the \"Saffron Revolution,\" these demonstrations drew international attention, with the monks seeking greater freedoms and an end to the military's grip on power. However, the government's response was swift and brutal, with reports of violence and human rights abuses mounting. Foreign journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist who ultimately lost his life, were targeted by the authorities, while the official death toll was significantly lower than the estimates of those on the ground. According to Colonel Hla Win, a former military officer who defected to the opposition, the true extent of the violence was far more severe, with thousands of civilians killed.\n\nThis is not a new phenomenon. The desire for absolute control and the suppression of dissent has been a hallmark of authoritarian regimes throughout history. From ancient Rome, where emperors claimed divine right to rule, to Japan, where the emperor is still revered as a deity, the pattern of oppression has been a constant. In more recent times, the world has witnessed numerous examples of governments cracking down on their citizens. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, where students and intellectuals clashed with the government, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias and government forces targeted Tutsis and moderates, are just two instances of the devastating consequences of unchecked power. The atrocities committed during the Holocaust, a period of genocide orchestrated by the Nazi regime, also serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed, in large part, to his remarkable longevity and his unparalleled ability to shape the sound of his orchestra. While often taking a discreet role on the piano, Ellington proved himself a master composer who skillfully highlighted the individual talents of his band members. By crafting a rich and intricate framework for improvisation, Ellington's compositions seamlessly integrated soloists and ensembles, yielding works of great musicality and coherence. His expertise in recognizing the unique timbres of each player, as well as their interaction within the ensemble, enabled him to create some of the most innovative and groundbreaking pieces in jazz history.\n\nA testament to Ellington's innovative approach is evident in his use of voice as a melodic instrument, as exemplified by Creole Love Call. This early piece showcases his ability to liberate the voice from the constraints of lyrics, incorporating it as a distinct timbre and texture. Notably, this slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues work features six distinct choruses, each showcasing a different facet of Ellington's compositional talent.\n\nChorus 1 establishes a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic tone before shifting to a more rugged, emotive quality. Chorus 2 features a muted trumpet solo, elaborating on the basic melody and emphasizing extended blue notes. Chorus 3 showcases a soaring clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano phrase. Chorus 4 sees the full band reprise the first chorus, with the brass and reed sections engaging in a call-and-response dialogue. Chorus 5 is the climactic peak of the piece, with the reeds initiating the call-and-response in a high register, while the brass and rhythm sections contribute a syncopated, stop-time rhythm. Chorus 6 returns to the structure of the first, with the voice adopting a growling, instrumental timbre.\n\nThe piece concludes with a brief tag, featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, novelty ending by a trombone. Ellington's use of voice as a means of adding tonal color is a hallmark of his compositional style, evident throughout his body of work.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded the following year, Ellington combines his mastery of orchestration with his acute sensitivity to timbre. The piece features a call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, seamlessly integrating the vocal aspects of Miley's playing and the instrumental qualities of Cox's voice to create a rich, complementary sound. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further exemplifying his ability to bring out the unique qualities of each player.",
            "She felt a persistent void within herself, an unfulfilled longing that had persisted since adolescence. The sensation had begun to nag at her when she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of her teenage years. Now, at 17, the ache remained, albeit with a subtle shift in focus. She yearned for human connection, rather than mere objects or superficial experiences. However, her disinterest in the boys who showed interest in her had left her bewildered, prompting her to introspect on the underlying reasons for this anomaly. \n\nAs she pondered her desires, she led a relatively peaceful life at home, surrounded by parents who exuded calm and tranquility. They rarely argued, and when they did, it was usually about her pursuit of independence and self-expression. This dichotomy created an intriguing dynamic, as her lively personality and kind nature endeared her to those around her.\n\nOn this particular day, though, the atmosphere was far from serene. As she moved through the house, searching for inspiration, she was startled by the unmistakable sound of her mother's distress call from the kitchen. The urgency in her voice sent her daughter rushing to her side, panic setting in as she frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" The mother lay on the floor, her face contorted in pain, and repeatedly whispered, \"Ow.\" The girl sprang into action, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder and asking, \"Aunt, what's wrong?\" Her mother managed to urge her on, her words laced with pain and urgency, \"T-take me to the hospital.\" The daughter swiftly obliged, carefully lifting her mother and guiding her to the car. She had been fortunate to have taken those self-defense classes, which allowed her to support her mother effortlessly.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and the anxiety-filled atmosphere were unmistakable, but her daughter's focus remained fixed on her mother's well-being. She briskly entered the emergency room, calling out for medical assistance, and soon a team of concerned faces gathered around. A rolling bed was brought in, and her mother was quickly assessed by the doctors. The daughter was left to anxiously wait, her eyes fixed on the medical team as they worked to assess and treat her mother's injury.\n\nIt was later revealed that her mother had suffered a fall from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "A comprehensive research endeavor aimed to investigate the correlation between adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (Med diet) and the incidence of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke-related mortality. The study employed a modified version of the Med diet, known as the alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score, which incorporates increased consumption of plant-based foods, including plant-based proteins, monounsaturated fats, and fish, while reducing intake of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption was permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a negative association between adherence to the Med diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. A notable intervention study revealed that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and lowering the total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio among obese individuals. However, prior research did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis epidemiological investigation involved a sample of 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63 years, without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, the researchers calculated the aMed diet score using self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) that assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year. Notably, more than 95% of the participants maintained their involvement throughout the study period. The FFQs were subject to validation studies to ensure accuracy.\n\nIncident cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, hospital records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions. Covariates, such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use, were calculated for each FFQ. Additionally, leisure-time physical activity was assessed beginning in 1986.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and better represent long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the aMed score from multiple FFQs were calculated. Adjustments were made for potential confounders, including age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nA Cox proportional-hazard model was employed to examine the relationship between the aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types.\n\nThe findings revealed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were documented. Notably, women in the top aMed quintile demonstrated a reduced risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The financial landscape of the United States underwent a significant downturn in 2007, as unemployment rates rose and the housing market teetered on the brink of collapse. Several prominent corporations found themselves on the precipice of insolvency, prompting a critical examination of the factors that contributed to this crisis. It is essential to investigate the root causes of this calamity and explore potential avenues for mitigation. A cursory analysis suggests that a combination of reckless and shortsighted policy decisions ultimately led to the widespread issuance of sub-prime loans within an underdeveloped financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were incentivized to purchase and repackage these mortgages into complex financial instruments, which ultimately proved to be a recipe for disaster.\n\nA critical examination of historical data reveals that the seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration. In an effort to boost his popularity and secure a second term, the President relaxed lending regulations, creating a fertile ground for the sub-prime crisis that would unfold seven years later. A prescient article by Steven Holmes, published in the New York Times in 1999, warned of the consequences of such actions: \"Fannie Mae, the nation's leading underwriter of home mortgages, has come under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage lending to low- and moderate-income individuals, while also facing pressure from shareholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes' insightful commentary was a harbinger of the impending economic downturn, which would ultimately precipitate a government-led bailout reminiscent of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\n\nSeveral interrelated factors contributed to the economic freefall, including the proliferation of novel and complex mortgage products such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These instruments served to entwine various sectors of the economy with the housing market, rendering households and financial institutions perilously exposed to even minor fluctuations in housing prices. As the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities found themselves reeling from the consequences. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively reported an astonishing $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The fallout from this crisis was severe: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at rock-bottom prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to undergo a dramatic transformation, subjecting themselves to intense regulatory scrutiny. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, found themselves burdened with an staggering $5 trillion in mortgage debt, prompting their government-led takeover in September 2008.",
            "The art of exposition - that treacherous stretch of narrative where even the most skilled writers risk losing their audience.  It's the section where the goal is to engage, to enthrall, yet all too often, the opposite occurs: readers disengage, hitting the back button or succumbing to torpor. Dr. Emma Jenkins' reaction to such passages is not unlike that of a pilot confronted with a sudden turbulence - she finds herself shouting at her monitor, frustration and annoyance mingling on her face.\n\nExposition is an obstacle many writers face.  Even those familiar with the fundamental \"Show, don't tell\" principle can find themselves sliding into lengthy descriptions of events that fail to propel the story forward.  It's the insidious voice within, urging the author to introduce background information, often in the guise of efficiency, only to bog down the narrative in the process.\n\nIn film, exposition can manifest as a character's lengthy monologue, reminiscent of Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, it's the author's attempt to convey crucial details through direct telling.  A telling example comes to mind: a heroine's backstory, detailing her meeting with a charming partner, their wedding, and the tragic loss of that partner.  Typically, this sequence would unfold over several pages, but with sparse dialogue and underdeveloped characters.  However, a more engaging approach would delve deeper into the husband's character, revealing his love for the heroine through his words and actions.  Similarly, the heroine's transformation, sparked by her relationship, would be skillfully woven into the narrative.  The reader would develop an emotional connection with the characters, investing in their experiences and relationships.  This would make the eventual loss more impactful, fostering a deeper understanding of the heroine's psyche.\n\nIn essence, the storyline \"They met, they married, he died\" needs fleshing out.  As a writer, it's essential to resist the urge to gloss over pivotal moments.  Consider the character of a former Air Force pilot, now managing a gas station by night, with a complicated past and secret aspirations.  A single line about his background may be tempting, but it's the subtleties - his mannerisms, speech patterns, and desires - that bring him to life, making him a believable and relatable figure.  The key is to provide depth, not just brevity.",
            "I viewed a pair of newscasts originating from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The initial broadcast, which aired live on NBC 4, reported on a disturbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. A male individual, identified as Shad Hostettler, was taken into custody following an alleged attack on his wife. Despite the gravity of the situation, the story was only allotted two minutes, likely due to its developing nature. While the details were limited, it was stated that the attack involved multiple stab wounds.\n\nThe subsequent report focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which left an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers, critically injured. No arrests had been made, and the SWAT Team was actively investigating the case. A notable aspect of this story was its brevity, which may have been influenced by various factors, including the socio-economic context of the neighborhood.\n\nAnother story highlighted the discovery of a gunshot hole in a Med-Flight helicopter. Investigators suspected a .22 caliber bullet, likely fired from a rifle, as the cause of the damage. A reward of $5,000 was announced for information leading to the apprehension of the perpetrator.\n\nThe weather forecast for the upcoming weekend predicted thunderstorms and rain, with temperatures ranging from the mid to low eighties. The segment was brief, possibly to pique viewers' interest in tuning in for further updates.\n\nA story about a robbery at a Clime Road convenience store in Columbus also aired. The suspect, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie, had allegedly targeted the store. The news anchor devoted significant time to emphasizing the suspect's racial characteristics, which may have been excessive given the circumstances.\n\nFinally, a report was aired about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation spanning from Texas to Ohio. The defendant had been sentenced to 300 months in prison, a sentence that was phrased in a manner that may have been intended to convey a sense of severity. Notably, the anchor highlighted Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage, although this detail seemed peripheral to the story.",
            "A deep and intricate connection exists between brothers, forged from an intricate tapestry of emotions. This bond encompasses a broad spectrum of feelings, including love, pride, resentment, and even a hint of malice. Brothers possess a unique understanding of one another, one that transcends their relationships with others. When gazing into the eyes of a sibling, they catch a glimpse of their own reflection, stripped of external influences. This profound insight is often revealed in the most trying of circumstances, showcasing the complexities of their bond. As these emotions unfold, they carry significant consequences, and it is through navigating these repercussions that one comes to grasp the essence of fraternal ties.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" masterfully explores this theme, weaving it throughout a rich, vivid narrative. Against the backdrop of a lush, evocative landscape, two brothers embark on a perilous journey, marked by bitter disappointment and intense pride. Ultimately, only one brother escapes unscathed. The author skillfully conveys the complexities of their bond through the protagonist's character development and interactions with his sibling, as well as the narrator's insightful perspective. This narrative voice effectively communicates the intricate emotions experienced by the protagonist and his perception of the world around him, which greatly influences his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, his relationship with his younger brother, Doodle, is characterized by a sense of disillusionment. The protagonist had envisioned a brother who could share in his adventures, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's fragile health renders these aspirations unattainable, leaving the protagonist's dreams shattered. The disparity between his expectations and reality sparks a mix of emotions within him, including a fleeting desire to abandon his brother. Yet, even this dark impulse is tempered by the child's simple, radiant smile, which reawakens a deep and enduring love for his sibling. This paradox highlights the complexity of the protagonist's feelings, revealing a duality of emotions that underscores the true nature of their bond.",
            "The human brain is a complex, dynamic system of information processing that has evolved in tandem with advancements in technology. The metaphors employed to describe this system have also undergone significant revisions, progressing from analogies rooted in ancient writing materials like wax tablets and papyrus to more contemporary comparisons with modern computing devices. While these analogies offer a useful framework for comprehension, it is essential to recognize their limitations, which can lead to misinterpretation. \n\nThe process of information processing begins with the conversion of physical stimuli from sensory organs, such as touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, into electrical signals. These sensory inputs are then repeatedly transformed through a hierarchical process, involving both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when viewing an image of a black box against a white background, the system initially assembles basic information such as color, orientation, and object boundaries – where the color changes significantly over a short distance – to form a representation of a box. Subsequently, top-down processing leverages prior decisions to expedite the recognition of the object, potentially identifying it as a black box rather than a box-shaped void.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain level, a regulatory mechanism determines its priority and allocates it to specific cognitive processes. For example, although the brain processes every blade of grass when gazing at one's shoes, a healthy regulatory mechanism prevents individual blades from being consciously perceived. Conversely, one might readily identify their name in a noisy environment. This hierarchical process of information processing involves multiple stages, with the regulatory mechanism modulating the flow of information at every step.\n\nIn order for information to be processed, it must first be stored in the brain. There are various types of memory, each with distinct characteristics, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with encoding techniques varying depending on the type of sensory input. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural, phonetic, or semantic properties. Following encoding, information is maintained through various mechanisms. Some research suggests that working memory, which holds information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal looping through a specific sequence of neurons for a brief period. In contrast, long-term memory is thought to be preserved through the structure of specific types of proteins.\n\nSeveral theoretical models have been proposed to explain the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing from diverse disciplines such as psychology, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented by nodes, which are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, the node \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be connected to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel Brave New World, the author critiques the looming threats of technological advancement and the capitalist framework that supports it. The society, where collective happiness is prioritized over individuality, is conditioned from an early age to pursue fleeting pleasure above all else. The inhabitants, it appears, are mere pawns in a grand game controlled by the World Controller, forced to conform to a singular ideology. By examining the work through the lens of Marxist theory, one can discern Huxley's underlying concerns regarding the emergence of these societal systems.\n\nThe novel employs Marxist concepts to satirize capitalism, utilizing the notion of false consciousness to illustrate how the common citizenry is prevented from understanding their true relationships with other economic classes. This is achieved through ideological control, as seen in the conditioning of the population through hypnopædia, which instills a desire for consumption and indulgence above all else. The World Controller manipulates this drive, ensuring the lower classes remain oblivious to their exploitation. The concept of hegemony, which describes the domination of social groups by a separate class, is exemplified in Brave New World, where the lower classes are unaware of their manipulation and the upper classes either accept their station or remain passive.\n\nThe relationships between individuals in the novel are superficial, lacking depth and distinction, which may suggest that the rise of technology and capitalism together erode human free will and emotional expression. Love and extreme emotions are absent, replaced by shallow interactions focused on physical appearance, as seen in the characters' comments about one another. Furthermore, the complacency of each social class within the hierarchy indicates the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, where individuals are convinced of their superiority so long as they conform and continue to consume.",
            "I've been a student at University Park for roughly two and a half years now, which translates to about four and a half semesters. For many, myself included, navigating the campus can be quite a challenge. During my freshman year, I was housed in East Halls dorm, situated at the farthest eastern edge of campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Commuting from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in Willard building, located near the center of campus, often took up to 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. A conversation with an alumnus closer to my age revealed that not long ago, the East Halls dorms were isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of unused land. However, this vacant space has since been repurposed with the addition of sports fields, new buildings such as the Creamery and the health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, moving from one place to another is becoming increasingly complicated. In a college setting, one possible solution to this issue is the bicycle. Nevertheless, having a bike is merely half the solution; students need to utilize it regularly, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with bicyclists in mind.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a several-year hiatus sparked some interesting insights. He remarked, \"Cycling is an excellent option; for a few years, it wasn't seen as fashionable to ride a bike, but it's the most practical way to get around.\" In addition to the physical benefits, cycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. With a nutritious meal and moderate physical exertion, you can cover distances of over 30 miles. As someone who now resides off-campus, I'm situated at a similar distance from the campus center as some dorms. The most sensible decision I made this year was purchasing a bike. Daily classes at Thomas building, roughly a 25-minute walk from my home, can be reached in just 5 minutes by bike if I pedal at a moderate pace. My main concern is that Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, can be a challenging road to navigate, regardless of whether I'm on a bike or on foot. While walking also has its merits, I find myself too time-pressed to walk. Without a bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation to class, and it would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine. Considering all the other time I'd spend walking to and from classes, appointments, and other activities, that's a significant chunk of time I could ill afford to devote."
