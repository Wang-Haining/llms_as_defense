            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My academic and professional aspirations are focused on becoming a social worker within the Division of Family and Children Services. This career path will enable me to make a meaningful impact in the lives of children who have been affected by abuse or neglect, as well as provide support to families in need. Key values that I aim to bring to the field of social work include a commitment to service, respect, and upholding the highest ethical standards. These values are not only essential for a social worker, but also deeply ingrained in my personal identity.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have been driven by a desire to contribute to the well-being of others, although it took some time to pinpoint my career goals. In high school and college, I witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of individuals turning a blind eye to their problems or resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. My academic background in Psychology at Piedmont College provided a solid foundation for understanding human behavior, but I still felt uncertain about my career path. Following graduation in 2009, I took a break to reflect on my options. A pivotal moment came when I visited a friend's home, where a 16-year-old boy was seeking refuge from an abusive situation. My friend explained the gravity of the situation, and the next day, I learned that the boy had reached out to the authorities. I offered to support the police in their efforts to address the situation, drawing on my Psychology degree to engage with the parents in a constructive manner. Their defensive behavior and lack of accountability left a lasting impression on me, solidifying my resolve to pursue a career in social work.\n\nAnother fundamental value that resonates with me is the importance of social justice. Our society often extols the virtues of individuality, yet seems to encourage conformity in practice. This paradox has always puzzled me. If we value the uniqueness of each person, why do we often prioritize blending in over standing out? My personal experiences have taught me the importance of challenging social norms and advocating for what is right. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively engaged in various initiatives promoting social justice, including participating in the GSBA (Gay, Straight, Bisexual Alliance) and speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I firmly believe in the power of social justice and will continue to be an advocate for change.",
            "This paper delves into the intricacies of insomnia, exploring the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors that contribute to this complex disorder. The biological model, rooted in genetics and medical aspects, seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms driving sleep disturbances. In contrast, the sociocultural model examines the environmental influences of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status on sleep patterns. This review aims to scrutinize existing research related to these models, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses while shedding light on the complexities of insomnia.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, which include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, as well as sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions or medical complications. Dyssonmias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia is characterized by persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep episodes. Conversely, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions involve difficulties related to Clinical Disorders (Axis I) or Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation (Axis II). This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to primary sleep disorders within the context of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders investigates the roles of genetics, heritability, and physiological factors in sleep disturbances. Recent research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin, which regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which play a crucial role in sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of the receptor reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This finding implies that an alteration or absence of this receptor could impact an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are twofold: if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disrupt sleep, potentially affecting various aspects of daily life, including academic and professional performance, as well as routine tasks that demand focus and attention.",
            "The auditory processing abilities of individuals with Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) are the focus of this paper. To begin, the fundamental characteristics of the disorder are examined. Following that, the diagnostic process is discussed, highlighting key indicators and warning signs. Finally, practical strategies are presented for supporting students with CAPD in inclusive educational settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition in which the brain struggles to interpret and process sound information efficiently. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), CAPD refers to the brain's impaired ability to decode and distinguish auditory information, resulting from an underlying neurobiological issue affecting the central nervous system. Individuals with CAPD may possess normal hearing acuity, yet their brains fail to effectively separate and differentiate sounds, conversations, or background noise. This impairment in auditory processing does not signify hearing loss, but rather, an issue with the cognitive processing of auditory data.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the mid-1950s, when researchers initially identified \"auditory imperception\" as a communicative disorder in children (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The pioneering work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954 laid the groundwork for developing diagnostic tools, while Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and a physiological model in 1961 further advanced the understanding of the condition (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 served as a catalyst for subsequent research on CAPD in children.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD often exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and processing auditory information in sequence. They may also experience auditory masking, where one sound is overwhelmed by another, or have trouble integrating sound cues to inform their actions.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation typically involves systematic observation of listening behavior, as well as performance on various tests of auditory function, conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other specialists (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These assessments may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory responses to specific stimuli. While no single test or tool is universally effective in diagnosis, a combination of these methods is often employed to identify the disorder. Advanced assessments may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "There is a theme in Twelfth Night that suggests a gap between the efficacy of deception and the consequences that follow it. The play implies that while disguise can successfully conceal intentions for a considerable period, ultimately, one must shed the disguise or risk losing their sense of self. However, abandoning deception is complicated by the potential for alienation from others. In some cases, those discovering the deception might remain neutral, but others are likely to react adversely, their feelings ranging from annoyance to offense.\n\nThe play's treatment of gender role reversal is particularly complex due to the various issues it raises. One of the most significant concerns is the motivation behind adopting a disguise. In Twelfth Night, Viola resorts to disguising herself as a man to protect herself from potential threats. As she navigates her new environment, she finds her disguise effective in safeguarding her, yet it also isolates her from her female peers, depriving her of a vital support system. Furthermore, her convincing performance as a man leads to confusion between her and her twin brother, Sebastian, as Olivia becomes enamored with the male persona, as seen in her declaration: \"Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Viola also grapples with the suppression of her romantic feelings for Orsino, to whom she is forced to express platonic sentiments: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTwelfth Night may be viewed as a case study of how deception can facilitate the acknowledgment of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages hint at the possibility that these characters may harbor unconscious desires, which are brought to the surface by Viola's presence. However, the likelihood of Olivia being attracted to women is diminished by her subsequent shift in affections towards Sebastian, where she begins to regard Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). This change in behavior suggests that Olivia is, in fact, a satirical representation of the societal norms prevalent during Shakespeare's time, where judgments were often made based on superficial appearances.",
            "Observations of the German colonial regime have highlighted stark contrasts, most notably the devastating impact on the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, such a broad description simplifies the complexities of the colonial empire, which exhibited a multifaceted nature in its policies and governance styles, as well as its geography. The provision of education across the colonies was equally diverse, with various outcomes evident in different territories. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a sizable population with a high level of literacy and education. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies garnered praise from contemporary authors.\n\nIn contrast, South West Africa, now part of Namibia, presented a striking disparity. In stark contrast to East Africa, where the government played a significant role in education, the South West African case saw the primary responsibility for native education fall onto missionary societies, which received limited government backing. The government, however, invested considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support for missionary institutions. This dichotomy had far-reaching implications for South West Africa, which persisted even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted considerable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, a substantial majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various interlocking factors, including social, political, and economic considerations, contributed to this divergence. This research aims to expand the current discussion by identifying these factors and examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThe existing literature on education in the German colonial empire is substantial, with many sources in German and dating back to the early twentieth century. Most of these studies focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies. Later works, written in English, built upon earlier research by conducting comparative studies of education in different German colonies and providing more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of distinct colonies. A notable work that explicitly addresses the topic of this research is Cohen's comparative study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies, examining the factors that contributed to their divergent development. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in South West Africa explains many of the defining features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa possessed a relatively temperate climate, despite the predominance of arid desert landscapes. The European population of South West Africa reflected the favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in the colony by 1913, a figure significantly higher than in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa, which had approximately 5,336 residents.",
            "The trajectory of popular music over the past century has been marked by an exponential proliferation of genres, rendering a definitive classification increasingly challenging. Moreover, numerous genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given rise to a multitude of sub-genres, further complicating the landscape. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most dynamic and expressive genres in the past four decades. Characterized by its capacity to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit predominantly darker and more intense, heavy metal has demonstrated an impressive ability to evolve and branch out into various sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has fragmented into numerous niches, making it difficult to pinpoint a unified definition of the genre. As a result of its malleability, heavy metal has assimilated elements from various styles, yet its origins remain a crucial aspect of understanding its current diversity. To grasp the essence of modern metal music, it is essential to first comprehend the historical context and the underlying factors that have shaped the movement.\n\nHeavy metal can be regarded as a movement defined by its affinity for the darker aspects of human experience. It is often associated with a heightened sensory experience, characterized by increased volume, intensity, and theatricality. In contrast to more primitive forms of music, heavy metal musicians tend to exhibit exceptional technical proficiency, which is deeply ingrained in the genre. Furthermore, the influence of psychedelic substances in the 1970s contributed to the creation of pioneering works that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy. The genre's affinity for the darker, more visceral qualities has been shaped by the Romantic Era's emphasis on emotional intensity. Examples of lyrics, such as those found in Helter Skelter, exemplify the genre's propensity for exploring the darker aspects of the human experience.\n\nHelter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of heavy metal. This song's dark and unpredictable tone, often attributed to the use of psychedelic substances, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker work. The Beatles' intention was to demonstrate their capacity to rival the Stones' sonic intensity, as evidenced by the song's inclusion on the White Album.",
            "It was not the Surrealist movement that first brought dreamlike qualities to the forefront of art. Instead, a distinct figure emerged decades prior, crafting works that would soon mirror his innermost desires. Henri Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, serves as a poignant representation of his own journey – a testament to both his personal aspirations and the internal conflict that defined his career. As he navigated the art world, Rousseau grappled with a dilemma: to conform to established styles and gain recognition, or to forge his own path and risk rejection.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream, one must first delve into the artist's backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's early life was marked by a sense of stability. His father, a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer, provided a comfortable upbringing. However, Rousseau's journey into the arts was unconventional. Without formal training, he began his career as a municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname douanier, or customs inspector, despite this being a misnomer. The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, left him with a single child, Julia, and a profound sense of grief. Painting became a source of solace, allowing him to rebuild his life and find new purpose.\n\nAs a folk painter, Rousseau's work diverged from the romanticized portrayals of peasants common among his contemporaries. His art reflected the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class. Rousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world was rooted in his circumstances: he began his career late in life, untrained, and contemporaneous with other prominent artists. Despite years of work, recognition eluded him until the rise of Matisse, a fellow modern artist. Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters that while Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, their motivations differed fundamentally: \"Matisse feared the triteness of painting, while Rousseau sought to create a picture so conventional it would secure him a place among the Artiste Français.\"",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has been a long-standing topic of interest among philosophers and thinkers. I propose that the connection between these two concepts lies in their fundamental nature. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is shaped by education and experience, yet our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional means of acquisition. Both ethics and aesthetics are descriptive pursuits, aiming to elucidate rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty often seek to explain why a particular work of art or literature is considered beautiful or moral, rather than providing a set of rules for evaluating or creating such works.\n\nCrucially, criticism and analysis can only capture part of what makes something good or beautiful. A discussion about the merits of the Mona Lisa, for instance, might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these factors do not fully encapsulate its value. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more nuanced explanation. I believe that both art and morality resist reduction to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, the essence of literature and ethics cannot be fully grasped through analysis or description. Even the most detailed examination of a work's properties leaves a residual aspect that cannot be captured.\n\nThe transcendent quality of both art and morality provides a common ground between them. Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion that ethics is \"transcendental\" – that it cannot be expressed – resonates with my understanding of the relationship between ethics and aesthetics. I propose that this je ne sais quoi, this ineffable quality, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This shared characteristic offers a connection point between ethics and aesthetics.\n\nOur experience of both ethics and aesthetics is fundamentally experiential, operating at a level that can be felt but not fully articulated. This is particularly evident in literature, which, as McKean notes, possesses a unique moral quality that sets it apart from other art forms. Literature's ability to engage us on a deep, personal level is rooted in its capacity to convey values that are central to human experience. As McKean suggests, \"Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The modern German nation is a dynamic force, with a rich cultural heritage spanning across the country's diverse landscapes, from the Alpine regions around Munich to the Baltic Sea coast in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is also characterized by the Rhineland's Cologne, the central regions, and the Saxon city of Dresden, situated on the Elbe River. Given this unique cultural identity, it is not surprising that Germany's history is the result of a complex blend of influences from various tribes and sources.\n\nGermany's ancestral homeland, Germania, has a disputed etymology. The origins of the name are subject to debate among scholars and historians. The Roman historian Tacitus attributed the name to the Germanic Tungrian tribe, suggesting they were previously known as Germans before their expansion across the Rhine and conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, which described his battles against Germanic tribes that crossed the Rhine, often under ambiguous circumstances. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls, distinguishing between the conquered and unconquered. In his account of the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes: \"Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, are in a state of constant conflict with the Gauls.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Some theories propose that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring people. Others suggest a connection to the Old English word \"ger,\" meaning spear, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which implies a loud or boisterous people.\n\nIn his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in 98 AD, Tacitus observed that the Germans were an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or external influences. He wrote: \"I consider the Germans to be aboriginal, with no admixture of other races through immigration or cultural exchange. Who would leave Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its unforgiving climate and harsh environment, unless it was their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Roman Empire's interactions with Germania were largely characterized by conquest and trade. While the Romans did not establish settlements in Germania, they did engage in campaigns to secure resources and goods from the region. Germanic tribes began to appear in the first century, living on the empire's borders and trading their goods and skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "My gaze drifted downwards, my mind receptive yet detached from the scene before me.  Observing the view with a practiced objectivity, I consciously avoided infusing it with abstract meaning, instead allowing my awareness to flow freely, unencumbered by preconceptions.  Thoughts arose and dissipated rapidly, as if they were mere wisps of vapor, leaving no lasting impression.  My mental state seemed akin to a fluid, constantly shifting and adapting to the stimulus, without any fixed reference point.\n\nInspired by an artist I had worked with, I had purchased a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I had long been fascinated by the idea of drawing, dating back to my early childhood.  This book offered a comprehensive guide, explaining the fundamental principles of perception and the cognitive processes that underlie artistic creation.  One technique it discussed involved isolating a subject by placing a mental frame around it, effectively simplifying the complexities of a scene.  For instance, a detailed still life, such as a bowl of fruit on a kitchen table, could be reduced to a simplified, two-dimensional representation by imposing a square frame on it.\n\nAt that moment, gazing at the bowl in front of me, I found myself unable to mentally impose this frame.  I was overwhelmed by the sheer presence of the bowl, and all I could do was stand there, transfixed.  Great artists, like Picasso and Monet, had their own distinct styles, marked by distinct color palettes – blue, green, and a kaleidoscope of colors, respectively.  If I were to consider myself an artist, perhaps this moment marked the inception of my own unique style, which I would come to call \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, my muscles tensed and relaxed as I began to move, channeling my thoughts into a tangible expression.  Water, serene and crystalline, seemed to flow through my mind, only to be disrupted by the harsh reality of my surroundings.  My hand, once poised to create, struck the toilet handle with a jarring motion, twice in quick succession.  The stubborn, brown mass remained stuck, refusing to budge.\n\nGripping the mop loosely in my hand, I stood with my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie feeling constrictive around my neck.  A look of mild annoyance crossed my face as I gazed at the unwelcome presence in the toilet bowl.  After a few more flushes, and a few moments of introspection, I turned to the wall to my right, grasped the toilet paper, and began to wrap my hand with it, creating a makeshift mitt.  Standing up straight, I leaned forward, and then bent at the waist, carefully dipping my hand into the bowl, as if I were handling a delicate, fragile object.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage fatalities behind the wheel has garnered significant attention in recent years.  A multifaceted analysis of this issue reveals that various factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  According to the National Institutes of Health, one crucial aspect is the biological immaturity of the adolescent brain, making it less equipped to handle the complexities of driving.  Furthermore, the lack of driving experience is a significant contributing factor, resulting not only in a higher number of fatal accidents but also increased rates of vehicle rollover, speeding, and off-road incidents. \n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center discovered a correlation between passenger age and traffic accidents.  It is not uncommon for teenagers to drive with their peers, a phenomenon that exacerbates the problem.  To mitigate this issue, some states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers.  However, these measures, in this writer's opinion, serve as a temporary solution rather than a long-term fix.\n\nA leading researcher, Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that 18 is still an inauspicious age for a full driver's license.  His research indicates that individuals under 19-20 are more inclined to engage in risk-taking behaviors due to the thrill-seeking aspect.  Postponing driving licenses until this propensity for risk-taking subsides seems prudent.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teenagers, the likelihood of fatal accidents will persist, and the death toll may escalate.  By 2010, a substantial number of new drivers will be hitting the road, exacerbating the problem.\n\nLegislative action to address this issue would be straightforward.  Driver education classes in schools could serve as a foundation for future drivers, while a universal age restriction of 18 for full driver's licenses would be implemented.  A provisional permit system could still be used as a stepping stone to a full license, accompanied by a set number of required driver training hours.  This number could be based on the existing standards set by most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  National legislation would provide a uniform approach to mitigating this issue across the country.  The proposed legislation is not an innovative concept but rather a sensible solution to a pressing problem.",
            "During an examination of the Edison film collection at the Library of Congress, I opted to screen all trick films from 1895 to 1901, a total of fifteen films that capitalized on creative editing techniques. My primary focus was on analyzing the poetic aspects of most trick films and identifying unique developments in a few later examples. Trick films from the turn of the century typically feature static camera placement within a proscenium frame, rely on long and medium shots, and adhere to a one-shot-per-film approach. However, some early twentieth-century films experimented with these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA common trait among trick films is their setting within an interior space framed by a proscenium. The camera remains stationary, capturing scenes from a fixed position. This composition draws from the influence of theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic shows. One constraint of this approach is that actors generally move horizontally, rather than approaching or receding from the camera. The film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) exemplifies this limitation, as actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal axis, remaining within the frame while the camera stays fixed.\n\nThe use of a proscenium style leads to a predominance of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in the Edison trick films, a convention borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance, framed by the stage boundaries. Actors typically remain in the middle ground, precluding close-ups. Most early trick films follow a pattern of one conceptual shot per film, which constrains their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This approach also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of trick films, which often focus on short, vaudeville-style illusions, such as magic, disappearance, and rapid scene changes with minimal storytelling. However, a closer look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) reveals that a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple physical shots, used to create the illusion of an apparition or disappearance.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the Republican ideology, driven by his passion for agricultural pursuits and limited foray into politics. His dual roles not only shaped his unwavering dedication to individual liberty and limited government but also influenced his views on governance. His agrarian values formed the foundation of his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system, as he sought to preserve and promote what he believed to be the superior vocation.\n\nTaylor argued that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of governance, unencumbered by the constraints of a native tradition. This allowed the founding fathers to create a self-governing system that embodied the natural rights of humanity. He contended that these inherent rights are interconnected, with the denial of one right diminishing the value of the remaining ones. Consequently, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference. He posited that the concept of the \"state of nature\" implied that those with physical prowess and cunning often prospered, but that in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be established, acknowledging the inherent duality of human nature. He subscribed to a rigid moral framework, distinguishing between good and evil principles. According to Taylor, good principles entailed protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging unchecked capitalism. He posited that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which he believed would inevitably be influenced by avarice and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a fundamental driver of human behavior, but also as a force that becomes problematic when it prioritizes the interests of a select few over the public good. A well-designed government was necessary to contain human nature's darker aspects and ensure that the principles guiding it remained virtuous.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He envisioned a federal government with strictly defined powers and responsibilities, limited to those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he cautioned that a literal interpretation of the Constitution, without consideration for the intent behind its creation, could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon examining Figure 17, a notable decline in commuter log submissions became apparent during the third month of the project, which prompted some introspection about potential causes. It is possible that the onset of winter on a New England campus contributed to a decrease in bicycle and pedestrian commutes, which may have accounted for part of the drop. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with final exams, grading, and other academic responsibilities, which could have led to a lapse in commuter log submissions. Furthermore, the holiday season in December often results in a prolonged break for students and faculty, during which time campus attendance is significantly reduced. The subsequent resumption of classes in late January may have also played a role in the low log submissions for that month. However, the persisting low number of submissions in February remains unexplained.\n\nOne possible explanation is that innovative projects of this nature often experience an initial surge in enthusiasm and participation, followed by a natural decline. In an effort to counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign designed to reinvigorate the initiative, which ultimately led to an increase in log submissions for that month. This highlights the challenges of sustaining project momentum in the face of seasonal fluctuations and holiday breaks common in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge inherent in projects promoting alternative modes of transportation is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving personal vehicles. To mitigate this, it is essential to offer incentives that appeal to individuals. We provided gift certificates to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, in an effort to encourage participation. It is intriguing to consider whether larger and more significant prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric vehicles, might have had an even greater impact on participation. Modifying the prize structure over the course of the project, perhaps by announcing increased rewards in December and January, may have helped to maintain momentum and prevent the decline in engagement experienced.",
            "One of the most popular investment vehicles in today's financial landscape is the exchange-traded fund (ETF), a security that mirrors the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a portfolio of assets, similar to an index fund. However, ETFs offer a level of flexibility that sets them apart from their mutual fund counterparts, allowing investors to buy, sell, and short-sell with ease, much like individual stocks. This flexibility, coupled with the diversification benefits of an index fund, has made ETFs an attractive option for many investors. A key consideration, though, is the expense ratio, which is generally lower than that of the average mutual fund.\n\nWhile ETFs offer numerous benefits, they also come with some drawbacks, including trading commissions that are comparable to those associated with individual stocks. Furthermore, with a vast array of ETF options available, investors must carefully evaluate the benefits of each fund, including the extent to which diversification is achieved. In this analysis, we will take a closer look at the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to determine whether investing in a single ETF offers comparable benefits to a diversified portfolio of the same stocks.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we have opted to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for approximately 63.58% of the ETF's assets. The following table presents the top 10 holdings, along with their corresponding percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the representativeness of these top 10 holdings, we will use their respective asset percentages to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio consisting solely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF. The calculations and resulting chart are provided below.\n\nThe data indicates that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this subset of holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is essential to conduct further analysis to determine whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo this end, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" showcases the author's notable literary achievements, with the use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which, as Thomas Ollive Mabbott notes, is a nod to the Roman poet Virgil. In his epic works, such as the Aeneid, Virgil employed the term to describe the island of Thule, situated beyond the northernmost reaches of Britain and the known world from a Greek perspective. While it is certain that Virgil indeed utilized this term, it is also crucial to acknowledge a more contemporary source that may have influenced Poe's choice of words.\n\nThe intersection of Poe's work with that of German authors is particularly noteworthy. His familiarity with the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is evident in his oeuvre. As Karl J. Arndt observes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" the similarities between their works suggest a possible imitation of Goethe's style by Poe.\n\nThe celebrated author Goethe is perhaps best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the latter part of this work lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem revolves around a king who receives a goblet from his deceased wife and subsequently becomes consumed by grief and drinking. The king's demise serves as a poignant commentary on the human condition, as he ultimately decides to relinquish his earthly possessions to his children, except for the goblet, and takes his own life by walking to a cliff, throwing the goblet into the ocean, and closing his eyes.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thule and the character in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both figures grappling with loss and, in the case of the king, succumbing to excessive drinking. Furthermore, the composition of \"Faust\" into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842 is a significant event that may have influenced Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" which he published shortly thereafter.\n\nPoe references Thule in multiple works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" where he employs the phrase \"ultima Thule,\" and \"Dream-Land,\" where he utilizes the term as a refrain, framing the poem. This dual use of Thule may be seen as a deliberate nod to Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" which shares thematic elements with \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate and melancholic landscape, haunted by the presence of deceased friends and devoid of color, echoing the king's emotions in \"The King of Thule\" as he struggles to cope with the loss of his wife and his will to rule.\n\nPoe's acquaintance with Goethe's work is likely due to his admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a poet he highly regarded. Poe's comments on Tennyson illustrate his esteem for the English poet, and it is reasonable to assume that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations that were widely available following the original publication of \"Faust.\"",
            "While a plaintiff who suffered a personal injury resulting from slipping on a spill in a grocery store might be eligible to receive punitive damages under California law, the likelihood of this outcome hinges on the store manager's actions. Specifically, if the manager demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the potential consequences of their inaction following notification of the spill, the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages may be viable.\n\nA review of the case suggests that a judge is unlikely to dismiss the plaintiff's punitive damage claim outright. In California, a plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages if they can provide evidence of the defendant's actions being driven by a willful and conscious disregard for the potential harm that might result from their conduct. Furthermore, the behavior in question must be deemed \"despicable\" by the court.\n\nIn this instance, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, may argue that the store manager should have been aware of the potential risks associated with failing to clean the spill, given that multiple customers had already experienced similar incidents in the preceding months. Moreover, the fact that the manager continued to fail to take action despite this knowledge may be seen as a conscious disregard for the safety of his customers.\n\nThe plaintiff's argument regarding the manager's actions being \"despicable\" is not entirely convincing, but is still a valid point given the store's history of slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. Prior to Palmer's accident, six such incidents had occurred, yet the manager failed to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, notified the manager, Paul Martin, of the spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a break and unable to address the issue. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, to which he responded in a similar manner. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. In the months prior to Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant's actions were driven by \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to harm, or, in the absence of such intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\n\nIn a relevant case, the court characterized conduct as malicious when the defendant was aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences. This standard may be applied in the case at hand, where the manager's failure to address the spill despite prior knowledge of similar incidents may be seen as a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of his customers.",
            "It's been nearly four years since I had the opportunity to delve into the subject of Islam in a course at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Throughout the duration of the class, one of the topics of heated discussion centered around the question of whether Islam can be perceived as a religion with a combative undertone.  In reflecting on the events that have transpired since the events of 9/11, I've observed a notable shift in the way mass media portrays Islam and its adherents.  The possibility of a presidential candidate with an Islamic background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unimaginable in 2001.\n\nI find the biography of the Prophet Muhammad to be a thought-provoking subject.  Based on my understanding of historical accounts, the biography of Muhammad appears to contradict the persona that has been traditionally associated with him.  Prior to my studies, I held the notion that Muhammad coerced conversions to Islam.  However, the biography portrays him as a figure who faced persecution and was willing to show humility in the face of adversity.  Instead of relying on force or coercion, people were drawn to his teachings through a more organic process.\n\nThere are also intriguing parallels between the lives and purported miracles of Jesus and Muhammad.  One notable example is the story of the miraculous provision of food for a group of men.  The narrative style employed in the biography of Muhammad has led me to believe that the author's intention was to present him as a humble figure who didn't require external validation, but rather allowed his actions to speak for themselves.  This approach, however, raises concerns that it diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nAdditionally, certain aspects of the biography seem to be designed to provide evidence of the authenticity of Muhammad's message.  The use of third-person narratives, where events are recounted through a chain of intermediaries, raises questions about the reliability of the accounts.  While the intention behind this approach may be to provide corroboration, I find it to be a drawback as it undermines the credibility of the stories.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way it seeks to portray Muhammad as a paragon of virtue and wisdom.  However, historical records suggest that this image may not be entirely accurate.  It's difficult not to wonder whether modern Muslims are aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A critical examination of the trajectory of Christian thought reveals a divergence from the original teachings of Jesus.  When viewed through the lens of historical evolution, it is observable that the Christian faith has gradually drifted away from its foundational principles.  The modern world exhibits an increasing awareness and a progressive inclination, which may signal a significant shift in the years to come.  While traditional adherents remain entrenched in their beliefs, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the broader narrative.  As historical awareness grows among Christians, there will be a growing desire to differentiate between the core teachings of Jesus and the supplementary doctrines that have accumulated over time.  This process may take several decades or even centuries, but its inevitability is evident.  Ultimately, a reversal of the trend in Christian history will occur, resulting in a return to the faith's original form.  A movement will emerge, gradually stripping away the layers of doctrine that have been added, much like reversing the hands of a clock.  As the movement spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire a renewed focus on the original message of Jesus, leading to a more uniform understanding of the faith.  Meanwhile, the institutional church will likely maintain its influence, guiding the way forward.  However, this reversal will also lead to a reduction in diversity within Christendom, as regional and denominational differences give way to greater similarities.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, including the transformation of the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, into a bastion of Christianity, and the progression from African-American slavery to leadership in the United States.  The forthcoming reversion in the Christian faith will be a journey of rediscovery, aimed at uncovering the source of the faith and, in the process, reducing diversity.  A crucial aspect of this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus' teachings as metaphors rather than literal statements.  Tracing the evolution of the Christian faith reveals that its roots lie in Judaism, the foundational faith that existed prior to the Roman Empire's takeover of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  By that time, Jewish thought had already developed monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and a reliance on Hebrew scripture.  However, the Jewish population was not a monolithic entity; it was comprised of distinct groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, each with their own perspectives and practices.",
            "Upton Sinclair's The Jungle presents a scathing critique of the innate characteristics of humanity, revealing a pervasive self-interest and lack of empathy for others. The novel masterfully illustrates this notion through the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their profit-driven ambitions above all else. Their relentless pursuit of wealth and growth is exemplified by the imposing factory structures, which stand as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of industrialization on the environment. Sinclair vividly describes the consequences of unchecked industrialization, likening the smoke and pollution to a \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery serves as a poignant commentary on the disregard for the well-being of those affected by their actions.\n\nThe exploitation of employees is another significant theme in the novel. Factory owners and managers demonstrate a callous disregard for the welfare of their workers, treating them as nothing more than means to an end. They engage in ruthless cost-cutting measures, pushing employees to work long hours without adequate compensation or protection. In an era with limited labor regulations, these practices were all too common, leading to the tragic fate of those who toiled in Packingtown's factories and lived amidst its toxic environment. Despite the absence of support systems for workers, some unions emerged, yet they often exploited the very people they claimed to represent, exacerbating the problem. Sinclair's portrayal of the workers as \"slaves\" is a powerful indictment of the dehumanizing effects of the industrial system, which perpetuated poverty, immorality, and despair.\n\nThe novel presents a grim picture of a society in which the pursuit of wealth and power trumps all other considerations, leaving the most vulnerable members of society to suffer the consequences. Through its vivid descriptions and compelling narrative, The Jungle highlights the urgent need for a more compassionate and equitable society.",
            "The manipulation of reader emotion and perception is a crucial element in literary works, and many authors employ various techniques to achieve this. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby, exemplifies this practice through a range of strategies. One notable technique involves the deliberate pairing of seemingly incongruous adjectives with nouns to evoke a particular atmosphere. Additionally, Fitzgerald frequently assigns symbolic meanings to various colors, which he then leverages to convey specific connotations.\n\nFitzgerald's utilization of color symbolism is particularly evident in the novel, as he builds and exploits the associations of white and gray to convey distinct ideas. Initially, he establishes a connection between these colors and the themes of uniformity and social class. The repetitive use of white and gray throughout the novel serves to reinforce this connection, with the former often signifying a sense of refinement and the latter, a sense of age and decay. \n\nFor instance, the characters of Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, which reinforces the notion of their privileged status. Similarly, the descriptions of Nick's journey through the city, where he encounters \"white chasms\" and \"gray names\" on a timetable, solidify the connection between these colors and the themes of social hierarchy. Moreover, Fitzgerald extends this symbolism to everyday objects and people, describing them as white or gray to emphasize their mundane and unremarkable nature. \n\nHowever, Fitzgerald also employs a reversal of this symbolism to convey the idea that certain characters or objects have become mere caricatures, stripped of their individuality. The reappearance of Daisy in white attire, for instance, serves to underscore her status as a chimera, a symbol of the unattainable and ultimately empty ideal that Gatsby longs for. Furthermore, the repeated use of gray and white to describe Daisy's appearance and surroundings serves to reinforce this notion, suggesting that she has become a uniform, two-dimensional figure in Gatsby's eyes.",
            "The San Diego area boasts an exceptionally fertile agricultural landscape, primarily due to its temperate and sunny climate. A diverse array of crops can be found in this region, including a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, and broccoli, as well as an assortment of herbs, tree fruits, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in San Diego, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic dairy products like eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, providing visitors with the opportunity to engage in activities like hiking and birdwatching, further enhancing the land's recreational value.\n\nMoreover, organic farming practices can have a positive impact on the local ecosystem by promoting biodiversity and reducing the use of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often comes with higher costs compared to conventional methods. Organic farming requires more labor-intensive strategies to control pests and weeds and maintain soil fertility without the use of chemicals, which can result in greater losses and lower efficiency compared to large-scale conventional operations. Furthermore, smaller organic farms may struggle to replicate the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. To mitigate these challenges, landowners may need to invest in additional labor and expertise to implement beneficial practices such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and managing plant growth to create specific habitats.\n\nThe proposed site, situated adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, comprises 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land is located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over 100 species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or at risk of being listed, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe region has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for untold generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production over the years.\n\nTo research potential options for mitigating costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations on this land, I identified a local organic farm in the same area and examined government programs that may be available to small farmers. This case study aims to illustrate the feasibility of establishing an organic farm on this site while preserving the natural habitat and biodiversity.",
            "The nuances of a culture play a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of negotiation. Culture can be multifaceted, comprised of both what it is and what it represents. It is not a uniform entity, nor is it defined by its homogeneity. Making sweeping statements, such as attributing certain traits to an entire nation or community, is an oversimplification. While understanding the generalizations within a culture can be beneficial, a more productive approach involves grasping the significance of that culture to the specific context and how it might influence the negotiation process. When interacting with a foreign culture, it's natural for individuals to draw comparisons to their own, which can facilitate a deeper understanding.\n\nTo effectively engage with a foreign culture or mindset, one may need to delve into its history, customs, and perhaps even its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept and work within its parameters, particularly in the context of negotiation, especially when dealing with a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for traditions and values in a foreign environment can also aid in bridging cultural divides and advancing the negotiation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture transcends national or international boundaries, and companies within a nation often develop their unique corporate cultures. For instance, some organizations prioritize long working hours, while others adopt a more relaxed schedule. This can be reflected in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, there exists considerable diversity in corporate culture between companies and even within the same company across different regions and urban or suburban environments. This diversity highlights the importance of looking beyond surface-level differences.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying values of a culture is also crucial, as they provide insight into the motivations and priorities that drive its behavior. For example, a culture that places great importance on saving face or maintaining harmony may be less likely to publicly confront or shame its superiors. Conversely, a culture that values a hard-driven bargain may be more inclined to negotiate aggressively. By considering these general trends and taking the time to learn about the individual involved, a negotiator can tailor their approach to achieve a more effective outcome.",
            "The notion that a higher power does not exist is often posited by those who doubt the divine.  This concept is first introduced in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and serves as a foundation for the philosophical arguments of St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. A comparative analysis of their ideas will require us to assume they are both attempting to prove the existence of a singular deity, as comparing their arguments to a more abstract concept of a god would be less meaningful.  We will therefore proceed under the assumption that they both believe in the same God as described in the Bible. In exploring their arguments, we aim to identify which one presents a more compelling case for the existence of a higher power.\n\nTo begin, we will examine the core of St. Anselm's argument. His ideas revolve around the concept of introspection, suggesting that the existence of God can be understood by looking inward. Anselm posits that because God exists within our cognitive framework, we cannot fully comprehend a world without Him. While this concept is sometimes convoluted and difficult to follow, the basic premise is that truth about God can be discerned through individual introspection. He implies that one need not rely on external evidence to confirm the existence of God, but rather that the truth is inherent within the self. This idea is often associated with faith, which is characterized by a reliance on internal conviction rather than empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more empirically grounded approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and observation, entirely independent of faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, as it would enable the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept a concept that cannot be proven. By presenting a logical case, Aquinas believes that the existence of God can be demonstrated through five distinct arguments: the necessity for a first cause, the origin of causality, the existence of contingent beings, the degrees of perfection, and the concept of order. Each of these arguments is designed to illustrate the logical necessity of God's existence. For instance, if a puzzle is incomplete, we can deduce the existence and characteristics of the missing piece based on the relationships between the other pieces without actually seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, a pivotal figure known as the Buddha emerged, destined to shape the course of history. As his life unfolded, he chose to renounce worldly pursuits and embarked on a transformative journey, culminating in enlightenment. The teachings of this enigmatic figure eventually gave rise to a profound spiritual tradition known as Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism standing as one of its most enduring manifestations. Over the centuries, this ancient faith has undergone significant evolution, manifesting in diverse expressions that diverge from its earliest forms. A striking example of this can be observed in the island nation of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada Buddhist community annually observes the water-cutting ceremony. This event, while seemingly incongruous with the Buddha's teachings, holds deep spiritual significance for both monastic and lay practitioners. This dichotomy highlights the dynamic interplay between tradition and adaptation, as the Theravada community has had to navigate the complex interplay of internal and external influences.\n\nThroughout this discussion, key terms will be employed to facilitate a nuanced exploration of the subject. To clarify, internal forces refer to stimuli originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation. Conversely, external forces emanate from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are characterized by a negative impact on the Buddhist community, often resulting from a distorted perception of the faith. By contrast, benign forces neither intend to harm nor help the community, although their effects may be unintended.\n\nTo establish a solid foundation for further analysis, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts comprising three primary baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into metaphysical concepts. Central to these teachings are the notions of Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to transcending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately liberating oneself from the bondage of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a framework for monastic and lay practitioners alike, outlining rules for living a virtuous life. For laymen, the five precepts serve as a moral compass, while for monks, a more comprehensive set of discipline is observed. At the core of Buddhist doctrine lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (suffering as an inherent aspect of life), the causes of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming it.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, a protracted period of animosity existed between the United States and Mexico, spanning nearly six decades.  This prolonged rivalry peaked during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the U.S. ultimately prevailed, annexing Texas and the southwestern territories (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  A series of confrontations, including border skirmishes and disputes over territory, punctuated the relationship between the two nations, which began to subside just before the onset of World War I.  Initially, the rivalry was fueled by fundamental disagreements over issues such as faith, cultural identity, and tradition, as well as the clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThe dynamics at play in this bilateral rivalry bear resemblance to those found in other neighboring nations.  Shared borders often give rise to conflicting interests, which in turn contribute to the development of rival positions between the nations involved.  The U.S.-Mexico relationship is but one example of a long-standing rivalry between nations that share a common border.  In fact, according to Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba are the only nations in the Americas to have consistently presented diplomatic challenges for the United States (p. 41).  Notably, both Mexico and Cuba are geographically proximate to the U.S. and have historically been rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also contributed to the tension between the two nations, a phenomenon that has occurred throughout history.  Frahm (2001) notes that, while the U.S. has historically opposed ideologies like fascism and communism, it was previously opposed to Catholicism and monarchical systems (p. 86).  Similar to the ideological underpinnings of the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the conflict between the U.S. and Mexico was rooted in a combination of ideological differences and competition over vital interests.  However, in this case, the ideological disparities were primarily driven by religious preferences, rather than differing political systems.  These underlying tensions were inherited from the historic rivalry between England and Spain, and continued to impede the establishment of amicable relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during the 57-year period of animosity (p. 145).  A significant proportion of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into the U.S. and other frontier problems.  The problem of banditry and lawlessness along the U.S.-Mexico border persisted until both nations deployed military force to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to ease as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. (p. 109), and ultimately subsided as the U.S.'s goals shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the latter half of the 19th century.",
            "It's been nearly two decades since my life took an unforeseen turn. At the time, I was a dedicated nurse, driven by a lifelong quest for stability and security. As I navigated adolescence, a recurring message echoed in my mind: \"You'll always find employment.\" This mantra, though well-intentioned, steered me away from my true aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist. Thus, I pursued a career in nursing, a field that offered a sense of predictability.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans. I found myself at 46, single, and financially strained, with a disabling condition that rendered me unable to work. Fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability benefits have left me with little to call my own. Each day is a struggle, testing my resilience and self-worth. It's a battle that I wouldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my loved ones and a handful of trusted friends. Their aid has been a beacon of hope in dark times, reminding me that even in the face of adversity, I'm not alone.\n\nThe experience has taught me a valuable lesson: life's unpredictability is undeniable. No matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to overcome solo. I firmly believe that we, as a nation, must acknowledge this reality and work towards a more cohesive, supportive community.\n\nWhile it's essential to be self-sufficient, I disagree with the notion that we should solely rely on individual efforts. America's resilience in the past wasn't built on isolationism, but rather on collective compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who braved the treacherous trails to the West Coast didn't achieve their goals alone; they relied on the help of their communities.\n\nPreparing for the unexpected is crucial. I've taken steps to ensure my preparedness, equipping myself with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a small cache of essential items. If possible, cultivating a self-sufficient lifestyle through gardening or preserving food can be a valuable asset. However, it's equally important to foster meaningful relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors.\n\nBy acknowledging our vulnerabilities and embracing a spirit of mutual support, we can create a stronger, more resilient society.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a subject of ongoing inquiry. While D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that the definition of organic forms in mathematical language is a distant goal still holds true today, recent advancements in mathematical modeling have led to the application of theoretical frameworks to mollusk skeletogenesis. A study currently underway is exploring the potential of mathematical modeling in combination with experimental research to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. This investigation employs X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative characteristics that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters are then fed into the computational program CerioShell, developed by Stone in 1995. Hypothetical shell morphologies are generated to inform the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, which are subsequently integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to deepen our understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a toroidal structure that traverses a 360-degree arc through space over time. The whorls, or spiral turns of the shell, are considered to revolve around an imaginary axis, referred to as the columella, which passes through the central column of the shell. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line, or suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The standard orientation is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this reference point, with estimates rounded to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be regarded as a series of openings that traverse space and time as the animal constructs its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening and the horizontal and vertical radius, it is possible to chart the shell's trajectory. This trajectory can be mathematically formulated and represented graphically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be manipulated to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "A stagnant neonatal and infant mortality rate has persisted in Indonesia for the past decade, despite progress in other Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets. While the country has made strides in certain areas, including a notable increase in births attended by skilled health workers – now accounting for 72% – the related improvements are mitigated by the fact that traditional workers, like midwives, cannot provide medical interventions in complicated cases, resulting in a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. The data also reveals a concerning trend of declining treatment rates for diarrheal cases in children under five by health professionals, as well as incomplete postnatal care data, suggesting a pressing need for improvement. Cesarean section rates are unacceptably low, at around 4%, and exacerbate a broader issue: unequal access to healthcare across the country, with a stark urban-rural divide. The healthcare access gap between the poorest and richest quintiles stands at 27%, underscoring the difficulties faced by the disadvantaged in accessing essential services, largely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering solutions, the primary challenge lies in effectively addressing the shortage of healthcare services. Essentially, the question is whether Indonesia should focus on strengthening its overall health system, or adopt a more targeted approach by developing program-specific interventions. While the latter, known as vertical approaches, can yield faster results by targeting specific sectors and objectives, it also carries drawbacks. Significant investments in one area of the health sector can divert resources away from other crucial areas and lead to a brain drain towards the more resourced sectors. Furthermore, multiple parallel programs can result in duplication of services, uncoordinated efforts, and an excessive administrative burden.",
            "The distinctive hallmark of Victorian literature lies in its meticulous attention to minute details and a preoccupation with the nobility of the era.  However, two notable exceptions to this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of enigma and a flair for the unconventional, unusual in the literature of the time.  This unusual approach lends depth to the characters, providing profound insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates the labyrinthine world of Fagin's underworld, he becomes increasingly beset by a maelstrom of disorienting thoughts and visions.  His mind is assaulted by the cacophony of Sikes and Crackit's contentious argument, and he finds himself trapped in a surreal realm where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur.  The staccato bursts of gunfire and the eerie cries of the crowd serve to further disorient him, as an unseen force propels him through a nightmarish landscape of pain and despair.\n\nIn Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the authors employ dream sequences and dreamlike states to heighten the sense of mystery and unease.  In the case of Oliver Twist, these episodes often serve as a window into the protagonist's inner world, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities that surround him.  The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28 is a prime example of this, as Oliver relives the traumatic event in vivid detail, his senses numbed by the sheer horror of it all.  The passage conveys Oliver's overwhelming sense of powerlessness in the face of his circumstances, as he is borne away by an unseen force, his emotions mired in a quagmire of fear and pain.\n\nThe shooting sequence serves to underscore the notion that Oliver is a pawn in a larger game, with forces beyond his control dictating the course of his life.  As he struggles to find solace in the face of his dire circumstances, Oliver's growing sense of defeat is palpable, as if he has been irreparably broken by the cruel hand of fate.  The passage implies that Oliver's inability to exert control over his own life is a hallmark of his character, a testament to the crushing power of his circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile, in Wuthering Heights, the author employs a similar technique to create a sense of disorientation and unease.  The passage from the novel reads: \"The day passed off – day!  There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A pivotal experience I had several years ago has had a lasting impact on my perspective on the challenges faced by students in elementary education. I was involved with an after-school program that provided academic support to students of varying skill levels, with a particular focus on those struggling in specific subjects. As an individual with strengths in English and reading, I was approached by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading difficulties. Initially, I noticed that his reading issues were particularly puzzling, as he demonstrated a good understanding of certain letter pronunciation while struggling with others. This peculiar phenomenon was further complicated by the fact that Adrian's mother, who accompanied him to the program, communicated primarily in Spanish.\n\nDuring a moment of clarity, it became apparent that Adrian's difficulties stemmed from his lack of familiarity with the English alphabet, rather than any deficiency in reading comprehension. This realization sparked a sense of urgency to find a suitable solution. Although I am uncertain whether this epiphany had a lasting impact on Adrian's academic trajectory, I hope that he has made significant progress since then.\n\nThis anecdote serves as a poignant reminder of the language barrier that exists in educational settings, particularly in multicultural environments like California. It highlights the need for creative solutions to address this issue. While some may assume that students who speak English fluently are not affected by reading challenges, this is far from the truth. In fact, even for those who possess native-like proficiency in the language, reading can still pose a significant obstacle.\n\nIn the case of Adrian, a tailored approach involving targeted English reading instruction, specifically focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved to be an effective solution. However, for students who are non-native English speakers, the solution is far more complex. A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be successful, as each child's needs are unique. A combination of strategies, including bilingual education, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and others, is essential.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, holds great promise. Research has shown that children participating in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and the potential lack of benefits for majority-language students, these fears are unfounded. Implementing dual language programs as a standard practice, rather than an exception, would yield benefits for all students. The question remains, however, how to implement this in a practical manner. Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is unrealistic, but providing bilingual support staff, such as tutors or aides, is a viable solution. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment that meets the diverse needs of all students.",
            "The notion that there exists something beyond our mortal grasp has been a recurring theme throughout human history.  From early childhood, we are exposed to various belief systems that aim to fill the void left by our limited understanding.  For some, this involves formal instruction in places of worship, while others may seek answers within or adopt the faith of their forebears.  However, not everyone conforms to these preconceived notions, often rejecting them in favor of a more individualized worldview.  This existential search for meaning is a deeply personal journey, as individuals strive to define themselves through their unique perspectives on spirituality.  It is in these moments of introspection that we seek illumination, yearning to transcend the darkness and find solace in the light.\n\nMy father's gaze drifted aimlessly into the rain-soaked evening, a mixture of contemplation and reminiscence etched on his face.  We sat together on the worn porch, the rhythmic beat of the raindrops on the tin roof creating a melancholic melody.  His usually robust frame had thinned, and his hair had begun to recede, accentuating the gaunt lines of his face.  As we silently shared a cigarette, I felt an unspoken sense of unease, as if acknowledging the impending loss would only make it more poignant.  I reached out, embracing him in a gesture of affection, and we both became lost in the somber beauty of the June twilight.\n\nTragically, we lost him in December, just five days shy of my twenty-second birthday.  The treatments had prolonged his life, but at what cost?  I couldn't help but wonder whether such suffering had any redeeming value.  As the darkness closed in, I found myself questioning the existence of a higher power, wondering if it had abandoned me.  In the still of the night, I chose not to seek solace in prayer, instead leaving my thoughts unspoken.  If a deity existed, I reasoned, it had long since tuned out my pleas.\n\nI opted not to witness his final moments, unable to bear the thought of watching the man who had given me life slip away.  I wanted to remember him in the vibrant, living person he was, not in his final, fading breaths.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I was confident that he would have wanted me to cherish the memories of our time together, rather than being by his side as he left this world.  For three days, I retreated into a cocoon of grief, waiting for the news that would change my life forever.  The silence was deafening, a stark reminder that, even in my darkest hour, I was left to confront my sorrow alone.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is often seen as an oxymoronic blend of the old and the new, as 18th-century literary critic Ian Watt noted in his work on the genre. Throughout the centuries, the Gothic mode has been subject to both scathing critique and fervent praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others seeing it as a masterclass in evoking the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). At its inception, the Gothic novel drew inspiration from a fusion of ancient romance and modern literary techniques. The pioneering \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, exemplified this merging of old and new by incorporating traditional theatrical elements and naturalistic narrative styles. Walpole's work, which he termed a \"Gothic Story,\" (Walpole 4) laid the groundwork for the genre, blending medieval themes, theatrical conventions, and architectural motifs with the emerging format of the novel. The term \"gothic\" itself was initially used to describe various cultures, styles, and eras, often with negative connotations, implying a lack of sophistication. The juxtaposition of the theatrical, antiquated \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative narrative structure allowed it to endure and remain relevant across time, simultaneously appearing both outdated and fresh to readers separated from the original work.\n\nA key element of the Gothic novel is the concept of chivalry, a medieval ideal of knighthood that Walpole's work preserves and reinterprets. Chivalry, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and competence, held significant cultural significance, particularly for writers like Walpole who perceived a decline in these values in their contemporary society. Through the use of chivalric motifs and ideals, the Gothic novel idealized and romanticized the past, foreshadowing the development of the Romantic movement. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's portrayal of characters like Frederic, a prince who embodies traditional chivalric virtues, serves as a prime example of this phenomenon. Frederic's description, which highlights his nobility, suffering, and gallantry, exemplifies the exaggerated chivalric ideal, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management is a multifaceted process that encompasses the logistical movement of goods from procurement to delivery, thereby ensuring seamless service to customers. This concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the intricacies of supply chain operations as a holistic process geared towards efficient and timely delivery. The six core components of supply chain management serve as the foundation for providing exceptional customer service.\n\nKey elements include production, supply, inventory management, distribution, transportation, and information management. By effectively utilizing these components, businesses can establish themselves as reliable service providers.\n\nThe production phase represents the initial stage of the supply chain, laying the groundwork for subsequent processes. To initiate production, it is essential for managers to comprehend customer demands, which can be gauged through market analysis. By understanding market trends, businesses can make informed decisions regarding product offerings and production quantities. The next step involves determining the optimal production location and facilities, taking into account factors such as product quality, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.\n\nOnce the production location has been established, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. A well-planned production process is crucial to avoiding potential delays and costs. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have implemented detailed processes and procedures to ensure a smooth operational workflow, minimizing confusion and maintaining high productivity.\n\nSupply is the second critical element in supply chain management, encompassing strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Businesses may choose to divide production into multiple divisions to cater to diverse product requirements. Managers must select the most suitable division for each process, considering factors such as equipment, personnel, and specialties. Outsourcing is another option, often employed to enhance velocity – the capacity to deliver quality products while minimizing costs.",
            "The claim that a notorious historical figure is alive in a Southeast Asian nation, now known as Myanmar, is nonsensically emblazoned on a makeshift sign held aloft by Ellen Page, a prominent actress known for her role in the film Juno. The stark contrast between her solitary figure on a street corner and the ominous message on her placard, scrawled in bold marker strokes, is a jarring juxtaposition. Myanmar, a country in the region, has been subject to a repressive military regime since 1962, following a coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests swept through the nation, driven in part by Buddhist monks and earning the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution,\" a nod to the distinctive robes worn by these monks. The protests, initially peaceful, eventually escalated into violent confrontations between the monks and the military junta, with the latter resorting to brutal suppression, including the ransacking of monasteries and the imprisonment of foreign journalists. The death toll, officially reported as 13, is disputed, with Colonel Hla Win, a former military officer, estimating that the true number of fatalities is in the thousands.\n\nThis disturbing phenomenon, however, is not unique to Myanmar. Throughout history, governments have consistently sought to maintain their authority and crush dissent, often with tragic consequences. Ancient Roman leaders, for instance, claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were revered as deities. In more recent times, we see parallels in the actions of authoritarian leaders, such as the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, where peaceful protesters were met with brutal force, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderates. The persecution of Jews during World War II, orchestrated by the Nazi regime, is another egregious example.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his impressive career span and demonstrated ability to shape his ensemble's artistic direction. Although his piano playing is often understated in the selected pieces, as a master composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and varied musical pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. By establishing a framework for improvisation and incorporating precisely orchestrated passages that highlighted the unique styles of each musician, Ellington successfully brought out the distinctive tone of his orchestra. His understanding of the unique timbres and interactions of his ensemble members enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's pioneering use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in his career, exemplified by Creole Love Call. This innovative approach involved incorporating voice as a textural element, free from the constraints of traditional lyrics. Creole Love Call, an early piece, exemplifies Ellington's ability to enhance the style of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. This twelve-bar blues piece, characterized by a slow and deliberate pace, features six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response pattern is established between the vocalist and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth to rougher textures towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, emphasizing extended notes and chromaticism.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo soars in the upper register, accompanied by a subtle piano ostinato.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble echoes the first chorus, replicating the call-and-response dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climax of the piece occurs as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high range, backed by syncopated stop-time rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: The structure of the first chorus is revisited, with the vocalist adopting a growl technique, soloing as a virtuosic instrument.\nA brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, rounding out the piece.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a means of adding tonal depth to Creole Love Call is reflective of a hallmark of his compositional style.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington skillfully combines his expertise in orchestration with his keen sense of timbre. The song features a call-and-response exchange between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, effectively blurring the lines between vocal and instrumental elements. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "A nagging void had always gnawed at her, a feeling that persisted despite her best efforts to satiate it. It began to manifest when she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of adolescence. Now, at 17, this unfulfilled longing still lingered, albeit with a subtle shift in focus - from an intangible something to a specific someone. Yet, her interactions with boys had yielded no spark, and she found herself bewildered by this peculiarity. As she pondered this enigma, theories began to surface, but none proved convincing enough to allay her doubts. As a result, she continued to live a life of introspection and questioning.\n\nOrdinarily, her days at home were marked by a sense of serenity, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. Her parents' relationship was characterized by a remarkable absence of conflict, and arguments with their daughter were rare. Their disagreements typically revolved around her strong will and independent nature, which often served as a counterpoint to their tranquil energies. Her unique blend of a lively personality and kind heart made her a likable and well-liked individual.\n\nHowever, today was an exception. As she roamed the house in search of inspiration, she was startled by a faint cry from the kitchen and the unmistakable timbre of her mother's voice. Her heart racing, she sprinted towards the source of the sound and found her mother lying on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, her voice laced with alarm. Upon closer inspection, she noticed her mother's labored breathing and urgent entreaties to get her to the hospital. The daughter sprang into action, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder and asking for directions. \"Okay, Mom, where can I take you?\" she asked, trying to keep her composure. Her mother's instructions were hasty and pained, but she managed to decipher them. The daughter quickly lifted her mother and carried her to the car, carefully placing her in the back seat before driving off.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the familiar scent of disinfectant and the hum of anxious chatter enveloped her. Yet, her focus remained fixed on her mother's well-being, and she darted into action, calling out for medical assistance. A team of worried faces soon gathered, and someone hastened to bring a gurney to the stricken woman. The doctors quickly took her in for evaluation, leaving her daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had taken a tumble while attempting to retrieve a vase from the top shelf of a step stool.",
            "This investigation aimed to examine the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, evaluates the consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. The diet also permits moderate alcohol intake.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, a controlled trial found that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, no prior research has specifically focused on the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis prospective cohort study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, food frequency questionnaires, which assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year, were completed six times. The questionnaires were validated through medical record reviews and were found to be reliable. Self-reported cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, probable cases were included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo reduce individual variability and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated by averaging scores from the preceding two years. The analysis controlled for potential confounders, including age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study examined the association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke. The results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet score had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The financial downturn that beset the United States in 2007 was a catastrophic event with far-reaching implications for the nation's economy. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the devastating consequences for several leading corporations exemplified the gravity of the situation. To prevent such a catastrophe from occurring again, it is essential to examine the factors that contributed to this economic downturn and identify potential solutions to mitigate its effects. The root cause of the crisis was a series of misguided policy decisions that led to the proliferation of sub-prime lending in a fragile financial system.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, under the Clinton administration, lending regulations were relaxed to increase homeownership rates among low- and moderate-income households. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the administration to expand its lending activities and from shareholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the potential consequences of these actions, stating, \"The government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\" Unfortunately, his forecast proved accurate.\n\nThe complex web of mortgage products that emerged in the years leading up to the crisis played a significant role in exacerbating the situation. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to a situation in which U.S. households and financial markets became increasingly vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in housing prices.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The consequences were severe: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at deeply discounted prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to undergo significant regulatory reforms. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The perils of exposition: a writer's nemesis, a reader's barrier.  It's the moment when the author's wings spread wide, only to find themselves stuck in the quicksand of unnecessary detail, suffocating the very story they sought to tell.  Even the most seasoned wordsmiths, like Dr. Merlin, can fall prey to the temptation of Too Much Information, their frustration evident in the muttered curses at their screens.\n\nWhile we've all heard the advice to \"Show, don't tell,\" it's a mantra that's easier to preach than practice.  Exposition can be a seductive siren, luring the author into the waters of tedious description and exposition, where the story's momentum falters and the reader's attention wanes.\n\nIn essence, exposition is the act of conveying information directly to the audience, often through straightforward prose.  In film, it manifests as the \"info dump,\" a cinematic cliche exemplified by \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, it's the author's equivalent, where the narrative is bogged down by unnecessary explanations.\n\nConsider a hypothetical example: a heroine meets her love interest, they get married, and he's brutally murdered in front of her.  A two-page summary of this sequence would likely leave readers uninvested, with both characters relegated to mere footnotes.  A more effective approach would be to delve into the husband's character, revealing his depth through his words and actions.  This would allow readers to connect with his fate and, by extension, the heroine's emotional response.  By fleshing out the narrative, you create a richer, more immersive experience for the reader.\n\nIn other words, a good story needs more substance than its bare bones.  A simple \"They met, they married, he died\" won't cut it.  As a writer, it's your job to add the meat to the bones, to make the narrative more relatable and engaging.  Sometimes, it's easy to get carried away with the details, but it's crucial to resist the urge to info-dump.  Consider the example of a character with a military background, now working as a gas station manager.  Rather than listing his entire backstory, you could subtly weave these details into the narrative, revealing his personality and motivations through his actions and dialogue.  By doing so, you'll create a more nuanced character and a more engaging story.",
            "This morning, I watched a pair of news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, dated August 13, 2011. The first was a live NBC 4 broadcast. The lead story focused on a violent incident in Ashley, Ohio, in which a man named Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife; her identity was not disclosed. The news team displayed his mug shot, which appeared to convey a sense of foreboding. Given the developing nature of the story, the coverage was relatively brief, lasting around two minutes. I believe the time allocated was suitable.\n\nThe second story reported on an early morning shooting that occurred in the Sharon Woods area, involving an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers. He was shot and critically injured, but no arrests had been made at the time of the broadcast. The SWAT Team was investigating the incident. This story seemed concise, and it's possible that the brevity was due to the fact that it involved a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. It's worth noting that crime stories involving minority victims often receive limited media attention, whereas high-profile cases involving white victims tend to dominate the headlines.\n\nThe following story addressed a mysterious gunshot wound that damaged a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided details about the incident's location and concluded that a .22 caliber rifle bullet was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension.\n\nAnother story highlighted the impending severe weather, including thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to remain in the mid to low 80s throughout the weekend. While the segment was brief, it served as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAdditionally, the broadcast covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned man wearing a hoodie, was reported to be approximately 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. The news team devoted an unexpected amount of airtime to highlighting the perpetrator's skin color.\n\nLastly, the broadcast featured a report on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation between Texas and Ohio. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. While it's not clear why the news team chose to specify the sentence in this manner, it's worth noting that mentioning his Hispanic heritage seemed tangential to the story.",
            "In the complex web of relationships between siblings, a unique dynamic unfolds. The bond between brothers is multifaceted, encompassing a range of emotions that often contradict one another. These contrasting feelings of love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty can be palpable, as brothers come to understand each other in a way that transcends the connections they share with others. When the stakes are high, the true nature of this bond is revealed, often in its most profound and unsettling forms. The consequences of this complex emotional landscape can be far-reaching, requiring those who navigate it to confront the costs of their actions.\n\nA poignant example of this dynamic can be seen in the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" Set against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, the story follows two brothers on a journey marked by both hope and heartbreak. In a climactic scene, the tension between bitter disappointment and intense pride comes to a head, resulting in a tragic outcome. Through the protagonist's character and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, the novel skillfully conveys the intricate emotions that shape the protagonist's world.\n\nAt its core, the protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, his relationship with his younger brother, Doodle, is marked by a sense of disillusionment and frustration. The protagonist had envisioned a different kind of brotherhood, one in which he could share his skills and experiences with someone who could keep pace with him. However, Doodle's health issues render such a partnership impossible, forcing the protagonist to confront the harsh reality of his brother's limitations. This sense of disappointment and anger eventually gives way to a more profound recognition of his brother's value, as evidenced by his conflicted thoughts about Doodle's well-being. The complexity of his emotions is particularly evident in his recollections of considering a tragic act, which ultimately reveals the depth of his love and compassion for his brother. The episode serves as a powerful reminder that even the most contradictory emotions can coexist within us, and that our true character is often revealed in the choices we make.",
            "The human brain is a complex, dynamic information-processing entity that has been the subject of various analogies and comparisons as technology has evolved. Initially, it was likened to a primitive recording surface, followed by a scroll, and more recently, to a sophisticated processing system. It is essential to recognize the limitations of these analogies, which can lead to oversimplification and inaccuracies in understanding the brain's functionality.\n\nInformation processing commences with sensory input from organs, which transmute physical stimuli such as tactile sensations, thermal fluctuations, sound waves, or light particles into electrical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly reconfigured through both ascending and descending processing pathways. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black rectangle on a white background, ascending processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and the object's borders – where the color changes notably over a short distance – to conclude that you are perceiving a rectangle. Descending processing utilizes the decisions made at intermediate stages of the ascending process to expedite your recognition of the rectangle. Descending processing in this example might facilitate identifying the object as a black rectangle rather than a rectangular void in the white background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain degree, a selective filter determines its significance and allocates it to pertinent cognitive processes. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, a healthy selective filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results of processing are subject to modulation by selective attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first be stored. There exist various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with encoding methods specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded in terms of its visual appearance, phonetic structure, or semantic meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Certain animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal circulating through a particular series of neurons for a brief period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained in the arrangement of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized within the brain, some grounded in human subjects' memory retrieval patterns, others based on computer science principles, and others rooted in neurophysiological considerations. The conceptual network model posits that there are nodes representing abstract concepts, and that these nodes are connected based on their relatedness. For example, in a conceptual network, \"furniture\" might be linked to \"chair,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, presents a thought-provoking critique of the intersecting threats of emerging technology and capitalist ideologies. The novel's society, driven by a relentless pursuit of instant gratification, prioritizes communal harmony over individual freedom and autonomy. From a young age, its citizens are conditioned to conform to societal norms, perpetuating a cycle of consumption and obedience.\n\nBy examining the text through the lens of Marxist theory, it becomes evident that Huxley is cautioning against the dangers of systemic control and manipulation. Key concepts like homogenization and reification are woven throughout the narrative, underscoring the author's concerns about the burgeoning capitalist system of his time. The novel's satirical portrayal of consumer culture and the exploitation of the working class is particularly striking, as exemplified by the use of Marxist notions such as false consciousness.\n\nThe concept of false consciousness is exemplified in the novel's portrayal of the lower classes, who are kept in a state of ignorance regarding their true relationships with the ruling elite. This is achieved through the use of hypnopædia, which reinforces a desire for consumption and indulgence above all else. The ruling class, meanwhile, exercises hegemony over the lower classes, maintaining their dominance through a complex web of social and economic control.\n\nThe novel's exploration of social relationships is also telling, as it reveals a society devoid of genuine connections and emotional depth. Interactions between characters are superficial, with a focus on physical appearance and material possessions rather than meaningful human experience. This is particularly evident in the way men discuss women, reducing them to mere objects of admiration, while women's conversations revolve around their physical encounters.\n\nThe characters' complacency with their assigned roles in society serves as a poignant commentary on the effects of capitalist ideology. Their unwavering obedience to the status quo is a testament to the ways in which systemic control can erode individual autonomy and freedom. In this sense, Huxley's novel can be seen as a scathing critique of the ways in which capitalist systems can perpetuate social and economic inequality.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, navigating the campus terrain has proven to be a consistent challenge. For many, myself included, traversing the grounds can be a time-consuming endeavor. Initially residing in an East Halls dorm, situated towards the eastern fringes of the campus, I would often find myself trekking to classes in more centrally located buildings like the Willard complex, a journey that could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when inclement weather made the conditions unfavorable. In speaking with an alumnus of similar age, I discovered that the East Halls residence halls were once physically separated from the main campus by extensive vacant land. Subsequently, the now-congested area has been transformed with the addition of sports facilities, new buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and surrounding apartment complexes. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly complicated. The most practical solution to this issue is the bicycle, yet its efficacy relies on not only its presence but also the campus's infrastructure and student participation.\n\nA conversation with a friend who had resumed cycling after a few years of hiatus shed light on the benefits of this mode of transportation. He reflected, \"Bikes are excellent, it wasn't cool to ride them for a period, but they're the best way to get around.\" In addition to providing physical benefits, cycling is an efficient means of transportation, allowing one to cover significant distances on a minimal amount of energy. Like many of my peers, I now reside off-campus, which is just as far from the central campus area as some dorms. Acquiring a bike was one of the most intelligent decisions I made this year. With daily classes in Thomas building, easily a 25-minute walk from my home, cycling can reduce the travel time to just 5 minutes if I pedal at a moderate pace. However, navigating Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, can be hazardous, regardless of the mode of transportation. While walking has its merits, I barely have enough time to attend to my academic responsibilities, let alone walk to classes. If I didn't own a bike, walking would be my sole reliable means of transportation, which would entail an additional 2.5 hours of walking time each week. Considering the time required to walk to and from classes, appointments, and other obligations, this time commitment is unsustainable for me."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",

(Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My academic and professional aspirations are focused on becoming a social worker within the Division of Family and Children Services. This career path will enable me to make a meaningful impact in the lives of children who have been affected by abuse or neglect, as well as provide support to families in need. Key values that I aim to bring to the field of social work include a commitment to service, respect, and upholding the highest ethical standards. These values are not only essential for a social worker, but also deeply ingrained in my personal identity.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have been driven by a desire to contribute to the well-being of others, although it took some time to pinpoint my career goals. In high school and college, I witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of individuals turning a blind eye to their problems or resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. My academic background in Psychology at Piedmont College provided a solid foundation for understanding human behavior, but I still felt uncertain about my career path. Following graduation in 2009, I took a break to reflect on my options. A pivotal moment came when I visited a friend's home, where a 16-year-old boy was seeking refuge from an abusive situation. My friend explained the gravity of the situation, and the next day, I learned that the boy had reached out to the authorities. I offered to support the police in their efforts to address the situation, drawing on my Psychology degree to engage with the parents in a constructive manner. Their defensive behavior and lack of accountability left a lasting impression on me, solidifying my resolve to pursue a career in social work.\n\nAnother fundamental value that resonates with me is the importance of social justice. Our society often extols the virtues of individuality, yet seems to encourage conformity in practice. This paradox has always puzzled me. If we value the uniqueness of each person, why do we often prioritize blending in over standing out? My personal experiences have taught me the importance of challenging social norms and advocating for what is right. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively engaged in various initiatives promoting social justice, including participating in the GSBA (Gay, Straight, Bisexual Alliance) and speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I firmly believe in the power of social justice and will continue to be an advocate for change.",
            "This paper delves into the intricacies of insomnia, exploring the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors that contribute to this complex disorder. The biological model, rooted in genetics and medical aspects, seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms driving sleep disturbances. In contrast, the sociocultural model examines the environmental influences of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status on sleep patterns. This review aims to scrutinize existing research related to these models, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses while shedding light on the complexities of insomnia.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, which include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, as well as sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions or medical complications. Dyssonmias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia is characterized by persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep episodes. Conversely, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions involve difficulties related to Clinical Disorders (Axis I) or Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation (Axis II). This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to primary sleep disorders within the context of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders investigates the roles of genetics, heritability, and physiological factors in sleep disturbances. Recent research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin, which regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which play a crucial role in sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of the receptor reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This finding implies that an alteration or absence of this receptor could impact an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are twofold: if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disrupt sleep, potentially affecting various aspects of daily life, including academic and professional performance, as well as routine tasks that demand focus and attention.",
            "The auditory processing abilities of individuals with Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) are the focus of this paper. To begin, the fundamental characteristics of the disorder are examined. Following that, the diagnostic process is discussed, highlighting key indicators and warning signs. Finally, practical strategies are presented for supporting students with CAPD in inclusive educational settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition in which the brain struggles to interpret and process sound information efficiently. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), CAPD refers to the brain's impaired ability to decode and distinguish auditory information, resulting from an underlying neurobiological issue affecting the central nervous system. Individuals with CAPD may possess normal hearing acuity, yet their brains fail to effectively separate and differentiate sounds, conversations, or background noise. This impairment in auditory processing does not signify hearing loss, but rather, an issue with the cognitive processing of auditory data.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the mid-1950s, when researchers initially identified \"auditory imperception\" as a communicative disorder in children (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The pioneering work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954 laid the groundwork for developing diagnostic tools, while Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and a physiological model in 1961 further advanced the understanding of the condition (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 served as a catalyst for subsequent research on CAPD in children.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD often exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and processing auditory information in sequence. They may also experience auditory masking, where one sound is overwhelmed by another, or have trouble integrating sound cues to inform their actions.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation typically involves systematic observation of listening behavior, as well as performance on various tests of auditory function, conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other specialists (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These assessments may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory responses to specific stimuli. While no single test or tool is universally effective in diagnosis, a combination of these methods is often employed to identify the disorder. Advanced assessments may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "There is a theme in Twelfth Night that suggests a gap between the efficacy of deception and the consequences that follow it. The play implies that while disguise can successfully conceal intentions for a considerable period, ultimately, one must shed the disguise or risk losing their sense of self. However, abandoning deception is complicated by the potential for alienation from others. In some cases, those discovering the deception might remain neutral, but others are likely to react adversely, their feelings ranging from annoyance to offense.\n\nThe play's treatment of gender role reversal is particularly complex due to the various issues it raises. One of the most significant concerns is the motivation behind adopting a disguise. In Twelfth Night, Viola resorts to disguising herself as a man to protect herself from potential threats. As she navigates her new environment, she finds her disguise effective in safeguarding her, yet it also isolates her from her female peers, depriving her of a vital support system. Furthermore, her convincing performance as a man leads to confusion between her and her twin brother, Sebastian, as Olivia becomes enamored with the male persona, as seen in her declaration: \"Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Viola also grapples with the suppression of her romantic feelings for Orsino, to whom she is forced to express platonic sentiments: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTwelfth Night may be viewed as a case study of how deception can facilitate the acknowledgment of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages hint at the possibility that these characters may harbor unconscious desires, which are brought to the surface by Viola's presence. However, the likelihood of Olivia being attracted to women is diminished by her subsequent shift in affections towards Sebastian, where she begins to regard Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). This change in behavior suggests that Olivia is, in fact, a satirical representation of the societal norms prevalent during Shakespeare's time, where judgments were often made based on superficial appearances.",
            "Observations of the German colonial regime have highlighted stark contrasts, most notably the devastating impact on the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, such a broad description simplifies the complexities of the colonial empire, which exhibited a multifaceted nature in its policies and governance styles, as well as its geography. The provision of education across the colonies was equally diverse, with various outcomes evident in different territories. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a sizable population with a high level of literacy and education. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies garnered praise from contemporary authors.\n\nIn contrast, South West Africa, now part of Namibia, presented a striking disparity. In stark contrast to East Africa, where the government played a significant role in education, the South West African case saw the primary responsibility for native education fall onto missionary societies, which received limited government backing. The government, however, invested considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support for missionary institutions. This dichotomy had far-reaching implications for South West Africa, which persisted even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted considerable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, a substantial majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various interlocking factors, including social, political, and economic considerations, contributed to this divergence. This research aims to expand the current discussion by identifying these factors and examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThe existing literature on education in the German colonial empire is substantial, with many sources in German and dating back to the early twentieth century. Most of these studies focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies. Later works, written in English, built upon earlier research by conducting comparative studies of education in different German colonies and providing more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of distinct colonies. A notable work that explicitly addresses the topic of this research is Cohen's comparative study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies, examining the factors that contributed to their divergent development. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in South West Africa explains many of the defining features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa possessed a relatively temperate climate, despite the predominance of arid desert landscapes. The European population of South West Africa reflected the favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in the colony by 1913, a figure significantly higher than in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa, which had approximately 5,336 residents.",
            "The trajectory of popular music over the past century has been marked by an exponential proliferation of genres, rendering a definitive classification increasingly challenging. Moreover, numerous genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given rise to a multitude of sub-genres, further complicating the landscape. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most dynamic and expressive genres in the past four decades. Characterized by its capacity to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit predominantly darker and more intense, heavy metal has demonstrated an impressive ability to evolve and branch out into various sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has fragmented into numerous niches, making it difficult to pinpoint a unified definition of the genre. As a result of its malleability, heavy metal has assimilated elements from various styles, yet its origins remain a crucial aspect of understanding its current diversity. To grasp the essence of modern metal music, it is essential to first comprehend the historical context and the underlying factors that have shaped the movement.\n\nHeavy metal can be regarded as a movement defined by its affinity for the darker aspects of human experience. It is often associated with a heightened sensory experience, characterized by increased volume, intensity, and theatricality. In contrast to more primitive forms of music, heavy metal musicians tend to exhibit exceptional technical proficiency, which is deeply ingrained in the genre. Furthermore, the influence of psychedelic substances in the 1970s contributed to the creation of pioneering works that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy. The genre's affinity for the darker, more visceral qualities has been shaped by the Romantic Era's emphasis on emotional intensity. Examples of lyrics, such as those found in Helter Skelter, exemplify the genre's propensity for exploring the darker aspects of the human experience.\n\nHelter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of heavy metal. This song's dark and unpredictable tone, often attributed to the use of psychedelic substances, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker work. The Beatles' intention was to demonstrate their capacity to rival the Stones' sonic intensity, as evidenced by the song's inclusion on the White Album.",
            "It was not the Surrealist movement that first brought dreamlike qualities to the forefront of art. Instead, a distinct figure emerged decades prior, crafting works that would soon mirror his innermost desires. Henri Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, serves as a poignant representation of his own journey – a testament to both his personal aspirations and the internal conflict that defined his career. As he navigated the art world, Rousseau grappled with a dilemma: to conform to established styles and gain recognition, or to forge his own path and risk rejection.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream, one must first delve into the artist's backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's early life was marked by a sense of stability. His father, a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer, provided a comfortable upbringing. However, Rousseau's journey into the arts was unconventional. Without formal training, he began his career as a municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname douanier, or customs inspector, despite this being a misnomer. The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, left him with a single child, Julia, and a profound sense of grief. Painting became a source of solace, allowing him to rebuild his life and find new purpose.\n\nAs a folk painter, Rousseau's work diverged from the romanticized portrayals of peasants common among his contemporaries. His art reflected the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class. Rousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world was rooted in his circumstances: he began his career late in life, untrained, and contemporaneous with other prominent artists. Despite years of work, recognition eluded him until the rise of Matisse, a fellow modern artist. Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters that while Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, their motivations differed fundamentally: \"Matisse feared the triteness of painting, while Rousseau sought to create a picture so conventional it would secure him a place among the Artiste Français.\"",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has been a long-standing topic of interest among philosophers and thinkers. I propose that the connection between these two concepts lies in their fundamental nature. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is shaped by education and experience, yet our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional means of acquisition. Both ethics and aesthetics are descriptive pursuits, aiming to elucidate rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty often seek to explain why a particular work of art or literature is considered beautiful or moral, rather than providing a set of rules for evaluating or creating such works.\n\nCrucially, criticism and analysis can only capture part of what makes something good or beautiful. A discussion about the merits of the Mona Lisa, for instance, might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these factors do not fully encapsulate its value. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more nuanced explanation. I believe that both art and morality resist reduction to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, the essence of literature and ethics cannot be fully grasped through analysis or description. Even the most detailed examination of a work's properties leaves a residual aspect that cannot be captured.\n\nThe transcendent quality of both art and morality provides a common ground between them. Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion that ethics is \"transcendental\" – that it cannot be expressed – resonates with my understanding of the relationship between ethics and aesthetics. I propose that this je ne sais quoi, this ineffable quality, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This shared characteristic offers a connection point between ethics and aesthetics.\n\nOur experience of both ethics and aesthetics is fundamentally experiential, operating at a level that can be felt but not fully articulated. This is particularly evident in literature, which, as McKean notes, possesses a unique moral quality that sets it apart from other art forms. Literature's ability to engage us on a deep, personal level is rooted in its capacity to convey values that are central to human experience. As McKean suggests, \"Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The modern German nation is a dynamic force, with a rich cultural heritage spanning across the country's diverse landscapes, from the Alpine regions around Munich to the Baltic Sea coast in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is also characterized by the Rhineland's Cologne, the central regions, and the Saxon city of Dresden, situated on the Elbe River. Given this unique cultural identity, it is not surprising that Germany's history is the result of a complex blend of influences from various tribes and sources.\n\nGermany's ancestral homeland, Germania, has a disputed etymology. The origins of the name are subject to debate among scholars and historians. The Roman historian Tacitus attributed the name to the Germanic Tungrian tribe, suggesting they were previously known as Germans before their expansion across the Rhine and conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, which described his battles against Germanic tribes that crossed the Rhine, often under ambiguous circumstances. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls, distinguishing between the conquered and unconquered. In his account of the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes: \"Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, are in a state of constant conflict with the Gauls.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Some theories propose that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring people. Others suggest a connection to the Old English word \"ger,\" meaning spear, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which implies a loud or boisterous people.\n\nIn his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in 98 AD, Tacitus observed that the Germans were an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or external influences. He wrote: \"I consider the Germans to be aboriginal, with no admixture of other races through immigration or cultural exchange. Who would leave Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its unforgiving climate and harsh environment, unless it was their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Roman Empire's interactions with Germania were largely characterized by conquest and trade. While the Romans did not establish settlements in Germania, they did engage in campaigns to secure resources and goods from the region. Germanic tribes began to appear in the first century, living on the empire's borders and trading their goods and skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "My gaze drifted downwards, my mind receptive yet detached from the scene before me.  Observing the view with a practiced objectivity, I consciously avoided infusing it with abstract meaning, instead allowing my awareness to flow freely, unencumbered by preconceptions.  Thoughts arose and dissipated rapidly, as if they were mere wisps of vapor, leaving no lasting impression.  My mental state seemed akin to a fluid, constantly shifting and adapting to the stimulus, without any fixed reference point.\n\nInspired by an artist I had worked with, I had purchased a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I had long been fascinated by the idea of drawing, dating back to my early childhood.  This book offered a comprehensive guide, explaining the fundamental principles of perception and the cognitive processes that underlie artistic creation.  One technique it discussed involved isolating a subject by placing a mental frame around it, effectively simplifying the complexities of a scene.  For instance, a detailed still life, such as a bowl of fruit on a kitchen table, could be reduced to a simplified, two-dimensional representation by imposing a square frame on it.\n\nAt that moment, gazing at the bowl in front of me, I found myself unable to mentally impose this frame.  I was overwhelmed by the sheer presence of the bowl, and all I could do was stand there, transfixed.  Great artists, like Picasso and Monet, had their own distinct styles, marked by distinct color palettes – blue, green, and a kaleidoscope of colors, respectively.  If I were to consider myself an artist, perhaps this moment marked the inception of my own unique style, which I would come to call \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, my muscles tensed and relaxed as I began to move, channeling my thoughts into a tangible expression.  Water, serene and crystalline, seemed to flow through my mind, only to be disrupted by the harsh reality of my surroundings.  My hand, once poised to create, struck the toilet handle with a jarring motion, twice in quick succession.  The stubborn, brown mass remained stuck, refusing to budge.\n\nGripping the mop loosely in my hand, I stood with my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie feeling constrictive around my neck.  A look of mild annoyance crossed my face as I gazed at the unwelcome presence in the toilet bowl.  After a few more flushes, and a few moments of introspection, I turned to the wall to my right, grasped the toilet paper, and began to wrap my hand with it, creating a makeshift mitt.  Standing up straight, I leaned forward, and then bent at the waist, carefully dipping my hand into the bowl, as if I were handling a delicate, fragile object.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage fatalities behind the wheel has garnered significant attention in recent years.  A multifaceted analysis of this issue reveals that various factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  According to the National Institutes of Health, one crucial aspect is the biological immaturity of the adolescent brain, making it less equipped to handle the complexities of driving.  Furthermore, the lack of driving experience is a significant contributing factor, resulting not only in a higher number of fatal accidents but also increased rates of vehicle rollover, speeding, and off-road incidents. \n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center discovered a correlation between passenger age and traffic accidents.  It is not uncommon for teenagers to drive with their peers, a phenomenon that exacerbates the problem.  To mitigate this issue, some states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers.  However, these measures, in this writer's opinion, serve as a temporary solution rather than a long-term fix.\n\nA leading researcher, Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that 18 is still an inauspicious age for a full driver's license.  His research indicates that individuals under 19-20 are more inclined to engage in risk-taking behaviors due to the thrill-seeking aspect.  Postponing driving licenses until this propensity for risk-taking subsides seems prudent.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teenagers, the likelihood of fatal accidents will persist, and the death toll may escalate.  By 2010, a substantial number of new drivers will be hitting the road, exacerbating the problem.\n\nLegislative action to address this issue would be straightforward.  Driver education classes in schools could serve as a foundation for future drivers, while a universal age restriction of 18 for full driver's licenses would be implemented.  A provisional permit system could still be used as a stepping stone to a full license, accompanied by a set number of required driver training hours.  This number could be based on the existing standards set by most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  National legislation would provide a uniform approach to mitigating this issue across the country.  The proposed legislation is not an innovative concept but rather a sensible solution to a pressing problem.",
            "During an examination of the Edison film collection at the Library of Congress, I opted to screen all trick films from 1895 to 1901, a total of fifteen films that capitalized on creative editing techniques. My primary focus was on analyzing the poetic aspects of most trick films and identifying unique developments in a few later examples. Trick films from the turn of the century typically feature static camera placement within a proscenium frame, rely on long and medium shots, and adhere to a one-shot-per-film approach. However, some early twentieth-century films experimented with these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA common trait among trick films is their setting within an interior space framed by a proscenium. The camera remains stationary, capturing scenes from a fixed position. This composition draws from the influence of theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic shows. One constraint of this approach is that actors generally move horizontally, rather than approaching or receding from the camera. The film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) exemplifies this limitation, as actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal axis, remaining within the frame while the camera stays fixed.\n\nThe use of a proscenium style leads to a predominance of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in the Edison trick films, a convention borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance, framed by the stage boundaries. Actors typically remain in the middle ground, precluding close-ups. Most early trick films follow a pattern of one conceptual shot per film, which constrains their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This approach also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of trick films, which often focus on short, vaudeville-style illusions, such as magic, disappearance, and rapid scene changes with minimal storytelling. However, a closer look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) reveals that a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple physical shots, used to create the illusion of an apparition or disappearance.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the Republican ideology, driven by his passion for agricultural pursuits and limited foray into politics. His dual roles not only shaped his unwavering dedication to individual liberty and limited government but also influenced his views on governance. His agrarian values formed the foundation of his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system, as he sought to preserve and promote what he believed to be the superior vocation.\n\nTaylor argued that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of governance, unencumbered by the constraints of a native tradition. This allowed the founding fathers to create a self-governing system that embodied the natural rights of humanity. He contended that these inherent rights are interconnected, with the denial of one right diminishing the value of the remaining ones. Consequently, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference. He posited that the concept of the \"state of nature\" implied that those with physical prowess and cunning often prospered, but that in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be established, acknowledging the inherent duality of human nature. He subscribed to a rigid moral framework, distinguishing between good and evil principles. According to Taylor, good principles entailed protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging unchecked capitalism. He posited that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which he believed would inevitably be influenced by avarice and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a fundamental driver of human behavior, but also as a force that becomes problematic when it prioritizes the interests of a select few over the public good. A well-designed government was necessary to contain human nature's darker aspects and ensure that the principles guiding it remained virtuous.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He envisioned a federal government with strictly defined powers and responsibilities, limited to those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he cautioned that a literal interpretation of the Constitution, without consideration for the intent behind its creation, could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon examining Figure 17, a notable decline in commuter log submissions became apparent during the third month of the project, which prompted some introspection about potential causes. It is possible that the onset of winter on a New England campus contributed to a decrease in bicycle and pedestrian commutes, which may have accounted for part of the drop. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with final exams, grading, and other academic responsibilities, which could have led to a lapse in commuter log submissions. Furthermore, the holiday season in December often results in a prolonged break for students and faculty, during which time campus attendance is significantly reduced. The subsequent resumption of classes in late January may have also played a role in the low log submissions for that month. However, the persisting low number of submissions in February remains unexplained.\n\nOne possible explanation is that innovative projects of this nature often experience an initial surge in enthusiasm and participation, followed by a natural decline. In an effort to counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign designed to reinvigorate the initiative, which ultimately led to an increase in log submissions for that month. This highlights the challenges of sustaining project momentum in the face of seasonal fluctuations and holiday breaks common in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge inherent in projects promoting alternative modes of transportation is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving personal vehicles. To mitigate this, it is essential to offer incentives that appeal to individuals. We provided gift certificates to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, in an effort to encourage participation. It is intriguing to consider whether larger and more significant prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric vehicles, might have had an even greater impact on participation. Modifying the prize structure over the course of the project, perhaps by announcing increased rewards in December and January, may have helped to maintain momentum and prevent the decline in engagement experienced.",
            "One of the most popular investment vehicles in today's financial landscape is the exchange-traded fund (ETF), a security that mirrors the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a portfolio of assets, similar to an index fund. However, ETFs offer a level of flexibility that sets them apart from their mutual fund counterparts, allowing investors to buy, sell, and short-sell with ease, much like individual stocks. This flexibility, coupled with the diversification benefits of an index fund, has made ETFs an attractive option for many investors. A key consideration, though, is the expense ratio, which is generally lower than that of the average mutual fund.\n\nWhile ETFs offer numerous benefits, they also come with some drawbacks, including trading commissions that are comparable to those associated with individual stocks. Furthermore, with a vast array of ETF options available, investors must carefully evaluate the benefits of each fund, including the extent to which diversification is achieved. In this analysis, we will take a closer look at the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to determine whether investing in a single ETF offers comparable benefits to a diversified portfolio of the same stocks.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we have opted to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for approximately 63.58% of the ETF's assets. The following table presents the top 10 holdings, along with their corresponding percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the representativeness of these top 10 holdings, we will use their respective asset percentages to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio consisting solely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF. The calculations and resulting chart are provided below.\n\nThe data indicates that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this subset of holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is essential to conduct further analysis to determine whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo this end, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" showcases the author's notable literary achievements, with the use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which, as Thomas Ollive Mabbott notes, is a nod to the Roman poet Virgil. In his epic works, such as the Aeneid, Virgil employed the term to describe the island of Thule, situated beyond the northernmost reaches of Britain and the known world from a Greek perspective. While it is certain that Virgil indeed utilized this term, it is also crucial to acknowledge a more contemporary source that may have influenced Poe's choice of words.\n\nThe intersection of Poe's work with that of German authors is particularly noteworthy. His familiarity with the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is evident in his oeuvre. As Karl J. Arndt observes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" the similarities between their works suggest a possible imitation of Goethe's style by Poe.\n\nThe celebrated author Goethe is perhaps best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the latter part of this work lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem revolves around a king who receives a goblet from his deceased wife and subsequently becomes consumed by grief and drinking. The king's demise serves as a poignant commentary on the human condition, as he ultimately decides to relinquish his earthly possessions to his children, except for the goblet, and takes his own life by walking to a cliff, throwing the goblet into the ocean, and closing his eyes.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thule and the character in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both figures grappling with loss and, in the case of the king, succumbing to excessive drinking. Furthermore, the composition of \"Faust\" into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842 is a significant event that may have influenced Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" which he published shortly thereafter.\n\nPoe references Thule in multiple works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" where he employs the phrase \"ultima Thule,\" and \"Dream-Land,\" where he utilizes the term as a refrain, framing the poem. This dual use of Thule may be seen as a deliberate nod to Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" which shares thematic elements with \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate and melancholic landscape, haunted by the presence of deceased friends and devoid of color, echoing the king's emotions in \"The King of Thule\" as he struggles to cope with the loss of his wife and his will to rule.\n\nPoe's acquaintance with Goethe's work is likely due to his admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a poet he highly regarded. Poe's comments on Tennyson illustrate his esteem for the English poet, and it is reasonable to assume that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations that were widely available following the original publication of \"Faust.\"",
            "While a plaintiff who suffered a personal injury resulting from slipping on a spill in a grocery store might be eligible to receive punitive damages under California law, the likelihood of this outcome hinges on the store manager's actions. Specifically, if the manager demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the potential consequences of their inaction following notification of the spill, the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages may be viable.\n\nA review of the case suggests that a judge is unlikely to dismiss the plaintiff's punitive damage claim outright. In California, a plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages if they can provide evidence of the defendant's actions being driven by a willful and conscious disregard for the potential harm that might result from their conduct. Furthermore, the behavior in question must be deemed \"despicable\" by the court.\n\nIn this instance, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, may argue that the store manager should have been aware of the potential risks associated with failing to clean the spill, given that multiple customers had already experienced similar incidents in the preceding months. Moreover, the fact that the manager continued to fail to take action despite this knowledge may be seen as a conscious disregard for the safety of his customers.\n\nThe plaintiff's argument regarding the manager's actions being \"despicable\" is not entirely convincing, but is still a valid point given the store's history of slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. Prior to Palmer's accident, six such incidents had occurred, yet the manager failed to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, notified the manager, Paul Martin, of the spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a break and unable to address the issue. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, to which he responded in a similar manner. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. In the months prior to Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant's actions were driven by \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to harm, or, in the absence of such intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\n\nIn a relevant case, the court characterized conduct as malicious when the defendant was aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences. This standard may be applied in the case at hand, where the manager's failure to address the spill despite prior knowledge of similar incidents may be seen as a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of his customers.",
            "It's been nearly four years since I had the opportunity to delve into the subject of Islam in a course at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Throughout the duration of the class, one of the topics of heated discussion centered around the question of whether Islam can be perceived as a religion with a combative undertone.  In reflecting on the events that have transpired since the events of 9/11, I've observed a notable shift in the way mass media portrays Islam and its adherents.  The possibility of a presidential candidate with an Islamic background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unimaginable in 2001.\n\nI find the biography of the Prophet Muhammad to be a thought-provoking subject.  Based on my understanding of historical accounts, the biography of Muhammad appears to contradict the persona that has been traditionally associated with him.  Prior to my studies, I held the notion that Muhammad coerced conversions to Islam.  However, the biography portrays him as a figure who faced persecution and was willing to show humility in the face of adversity.  Instead of relying on force or coercion, people were drawn to his teachings through a more organic process.\n\nThere are also intriguing parallels between the lives and purported miracles of Jesus and Muhammad.  One notable example is the story of the miraculous provision of food for a group of men.  The narrative style employed in the biography of Muhammad has led me to believe that the author's intention was to present him as a humble figure who didn't require external validation, but rather allowed his actions to speak for themselves.  This approach, however, raises concerns that it diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nAdditionally, certain aspects of the biography seem to be designed to provide evidence of the authenticity of Muhammad's message.  The use of third-person narratives, where events are recounted through a chain of intermediaries, raises questions about the reliability of the accounts.  While the intention behind this approach may be to provide corroboration, I find it to be a drawback as it undermines the credibility of the stories.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way it seeks to portray Muhammad as a paragon of virtue and wisdom.  However, historical records suggest that this image may not be entirely accurate.  It's difficult not to wonder whether modern Muslims are aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A critical examination of the trajectory of Christian thought reveals a divergence from the original teachings of Jesus.  When viewed through the lens of historical evolution, it is observable that the Christian faith has gradually drifted away from its foundational principles.  The modern world exhibits an increasing awareness and a progressive inclination, which may signal a significant shift in the years to come.  While traditional adherents remain entrenched in their beliefs, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the broader narrative.  As historical awareness grows among Christians, there will be a growing desire to differentiate between the core teachings of Jesus and the supplementary doctrines that have accumulated over time.  This process may take several decades or even centuries, but its inevitability is evident.  Ultimately, a reversal of the trend in Christian history will occur, resulting in a return to the faith's original form.  A movement will emerge, gradually stripping away the layers of doctrine that have been added, much like reversing the hands of a clock.  As the movement spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire a renewed focus on the original message of Jesus, leading to a more uniform understanding of the faith.  Meanwhile, the institutional church will likely maintain its influence, guiding the way forward.  However, this reversal will also lead to a reduction in diversity within Christendom, as regional and denominational differences give way to greater similarities.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, including the transformation of the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, into a bastion of Christianity, and the progression from African-American slavery to leadership in the United States.  The forthcoming reversion in the Christian faith will be a journey of rediscovery, aimed at uncovering the source of the faith and, in the process, reducing diversity.  A crucial aspect of this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus' teachings as metaphors rather than literal statements.  Tracing the evolution of the Christian faith reveals that its roots lie in Judaism, the foundational faith that existed prior to the Roman Empire's takeover of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  By that time, Jewish thought had already developed monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and a reliance on Hebrew scripture.  However, the Jewish population was not a monolithic entity; it was comprised of distinct groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, each with their own perspectives and practices.",
            "Upton Sinclair's The Jungle presents a scathing critique of the innate characteristics of humanity, revealing a pervasive self-interest and lack of empathy for others. The novel masterfully illustrates this notion through the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their profit-driven ambitions above all else. Their relentless pursuit of wealth and growth is exemplified by the imposing factory structures, which stand as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of industrialization on the environment. Sinclair vividly describes the consequences of unchecked industrialization, likening the smoke and pollution to a \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery serves as a poignant commentary on the disregard for the well-being of those affected by their actions.\n\nThe exploitation of employees is another significant theme in the novel. Factory owners and managers demonstrate a callous disregard for the welfare of their workers, treating them as nothing more than means to an end. They engage in ruthless cost-cutting measures, pushing employees to work long hours without adequate compensation or protection. In an era with limited labor regulations, these practices were all too common, leading to the tragic fate of those who toiled in Packingtown's factories and lived amidst its toxic environment. Despite the absence of support systems for workers, some unions emerged, yet they often exploited the very people they claimed to represent, exacerbating the problem. Sinclair's portrayal of the workers as \"slaves\" is a powerful indictment of the dehumanizing effects of the industrial system, which perpetuated poverty, immorality, and despair.\n\nThe novel presents a grim picture of a society in which the pursuit of wealth and power trumps all other considerations, leaving the most vulnerable members of society to suffer the consequences. Through its vivid descriptions and compelling narrative, The Jungle highlights the urgent need for a more compassionate and equitable society.",
            "The manipulation of reader emotion and perception is a crucial element in literary works, and many authors employ various techniques to achieve this. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby, exemplifies this practice through a range of strategies. One notable technique involves the deliberate pairing of seemingly incongruous adjectives with nouns to evoke a particular atmosphere. Additionally, Fitzgerald frequently assigns symbolic meanings to various colors, which he then leverages to convey specific connotations.\n\nFitzgerald's utilization of color symbolism is particularly evident in the novel, as he builds and exploits the associations of white and gray to convey distinct ideas. Initially, he establishes a connection between these colors and the themes of uniformity and social class. The repetitive use of white and gray throughout the novel serves to reinforce this connection, with the former often signifying a sense of refinement and the latter, a sense of age and decay. \n\nFor instance, the characters of Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, which reinforces the notion of their privileged status. Similarly, the descriptions of Nick's journey through the city, where he encounters \"white chasms\" and \"gray names\" on a timetable, solidify the connection between these colors and the themes of social hierarchy. Moreover, Fitzgerald extends this symbolism to everyday objects and people, describing them as white or gray to emphasize their mundane and unremarkable nature. \n\nHowever, Fitzgerald also employs a reversal of this symbolism to convey the idea that certain characters or objects have become mere caricatures, stripped of their individuality. The reappearance of Daisy in white attire, for instance, serves to underscore her status as a chimera, a symbol of the unattainable and ultimately empty ideal that Gatsby longs for. Furthermore, the repeated use of gray and white to describe Daisy's appearance and surroundings serves to reinforce this notion, suggesting that she has become a uniform, two-dimensional figure in Gatsby's eyes.",
            "The San Diego area boasts an exceptionally fertile agricultural landscape, primarily due to its temperate and sunny climate. A diverse array of crops can be found in this region, including a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, and broccoli, as well as an assortment of herbs, tree fruits, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in San Diego, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic dairy products like eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, providing visitors with the opportunity to engage in activities like hiking and birdwatching, further enhancing the land's recreational value.\n\nMoreover, organic farming practices can have a positive impact on the local ecosystem by promoting biodiversity and reducing the use of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often comes with higher costs compared to conventional methods. Organic farming requires more labor-intensive strategies to control pests and weeds and maintain soil fertility without the use of chemicals, which can result in greater losses and lower efficiency compared to large-scale conventional operations. Furthermore, smaller organic farms may struggle to replicate the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. To mitigate these challenges, landowners may need to invest in additional labor and expertise to implement beneficial practices such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and managing plant growth to create specific habitats.\n\nThe proposed site, situated adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, comprises 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land is located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over 100 species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or at risk of being listed, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe region has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for untold generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production over the years.\n\nTo research potential options for mitigating costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations on this land, I identified a local organic farm in the same area and examined government programs that may be available to small farmers. This case study aims to illustrate the feasibility of establishing an organic farm on this site while preserving the natural habitat and biodiversity.",
            "The nuances of a culture play a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of negotiation. Culture can be multifaceted, comprised of both what it is and what it represents. It is not a uniform entity, nor is it defined by its homogeneity. Making sweeping statements, such as attributing certain traits to an entire nation or community, is an oversimplification. While understanding the generalizations within a culture can be beneficial, a more productive approach involves grasping the significance of that culture to the specific context and how it might influence the negotiation process. When interacting with a foreign culture, it's natural for individuals to draw comparisons to their own, which can facilitate a deeper understanding.\n\nTo effectively engage with a foreign culture or mindset, one may need to delve into its history, customs, and perhaps even its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept and work within its parameters, particularly in the context of negotiation, especially when dealing with a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for traditions and values in a foreign environment can also aid in bridging cultural divides and advancing the negotiation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture transcends national or international boundaries, and companies within a nation often develop their unique corporate cultures. For instance, some organizations prioritize long working hours, while others adopt a more relaxed schedule. This can be reflected in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, there exists considerable diversity in corporate culture between companies and even within the same company across different regions and urban or suburban environments. This diversity highlights the importance of looking beyond surface-level differences.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying values of a culture is also crucial, as they provide insight into the motivations and priorities that drive its behavior. For example, a culture that places great importance on saving face or maintaining harmony may be less likely to publicly confront or shame its superiors. Conversely, a culture that values a hard-driven bargain may be more inclined to negotiate aggressively. By considering these general trends and taking the time to learn about the individual involved, a negotiator can tailor their approach to achieve a more effective outcome.",
            "The notion that a higher power does not exist is often posited by those who doubt the divine.  This concept is first introduced in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and serves as a foundation for the philosophical arguments of St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. A comparative analysis of their ideas will require us to assume they are both attempting to prove the existence of a singular deity, as comparing their arguments to a more abstract concept of a god would be less meaningful.  We will therefore proceed under the assumption that they both believe in the same God as described in the Bible. In exploring their arguments, we aim to identify which one presents a more compelling case for the existence of a higher power.\n\nTo begin, we will examine the core of St. Anselm's argument. His ideas revolve around the concept of introspection, suggesting that the existence of God can be understood by looking inward. Anselm posits that because God exists within our cognitive framework, we cannot fully comprehend a world without Him. While this concept is sometimes convoluted and difficult to follow, the basic premise is that truth about God can be discerned through individual introspection. He implies that one need not rely on external evidence to confirm the existence of God, but rather that the truth is inherent within the self. This idea is often associated with faith, which is characterized by a reliance on internal conviction rather than empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more empirically grounded approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and observation, entirely independent of faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, as it would enable the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept a concept that cannot be proven. By presenting a logical case, Aquinas believes that the existence of God can be demonstrated through five distinct arguments: the necessity for a first cause, the origin of causality, the existence of contingent beings, the degrees of perfection, and the concept of order. Each of these arguments is designed to illustrate the logical necessity of God's existence. For instance, if a puzzle is incomplete, we can deduce the existence and characteristics of the missing piece based on the relationships between the other pieces without actually seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, a pivotal figure known as the Buddha emerged, destined to shape the course of history. As his life unfolded, he chose to renounce worldly pursuits and embarked on a transformative journey, culminating in enlightenment. The teachings of this enigmatic figure eventually gave rise to a profound spiritual tradition known as Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism standing as one of its most enduring manifestations. Over the centuries, this ancient faith has undergone significant evolution, manifesting in diverse expressions that diverge from its earliest forms. A striking example of this can be observed in the island nation of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada Buddhist community annually observes the water-cutting ceremony. This event, while seemingly incongruous with the Buddha's teachings, holds deep spiritual significance for both monastic and lay practitioners. This dichotomy highlights the dynamic interplay between tradition and adaptation, as the Theravada community has had to navigate the complex interplay of internal and external influences.\n\nThroughout this discussion, key terms will be employed to facilitate a nuanced exploration of the subject. To clarify, internal forces refer to stimuli originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation. Conversely, external forces emanate from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are characterized by a negative impact on the Buddhist community, often resulting from a distorted perception of the faith. By contrast, benign forces neither intend to harm nor help the community, although their effects may be unintended.\n\nTo establish a solid foundation for further analysis, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts comprising three primary baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into metaphysical concepts. Central to these teachings are the notions of Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to transcending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately liberating oneself from the bondage of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a framework for monastic and lay practitioners alike, outlining rules for living a virtuous life. For laymen, the five precepts serve as a moral compass, while for monks, a more comprehensive set of discipline is observed. At the core of Buddhist doctrine lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (suffering as an inherent aspect of life), the causes of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming it.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, a protracted period of animosity existed between the United States and Mexico, spanning nearly six decades.  This prolonged rivalry peaked during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the U.S. ultimately prevailed, annexing Texas and the southwestern territories (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  A series of confrontations, including border skirmishes and disputes over territory, punctuated the relationship between the two nations, which began to subside just before the onset of World War I.  Initially, the rivalry was fueled by fundamental disagreements over issues such as faith, cultural identity, and tradition, as well as the clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThe dynamics at play in this bilateral rivalry bear resemblance to those found in other neighboring nations.  Shared borders often give rise to conflicting interests, which in turn contribute to the development of rival positions between the nations involved.  The U.S.-Mexico relationship is but one example of a long-standing rivalry between nations that share a common border.  In fact, according to Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba are the only nations in the Americas to have consistently presented diplomatic challenges for the United States (p. 41).  Notably, both Mexico and Cuba are geographically proximate to the U.S. and have historically been rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also contributed to the tension between the two nations, a phenomenon that has occurred throughout history.  Frahm (2001) notes that, while the U.S. has historically opposed ideologies like fascism and communism, it was previously opposed to Catholicism and monarchical systems (p. 86).  Similar to the ideological underpinnings of the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the conflict between the U.S. and Mexico was rooted in a combination of ideological differences and competition over vital interests.  However, in this case, the ideological disparities were primarily driven by religious preferences, rather than differing political systems.  These underlying tensions were inherited from the historic rivalry between England and Spain, and continued to impede the establishment of amicable relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during the 57-year period of animosity (p. 145).  A significant proportion of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into the U.S. and other frontier problems.  The problem of banditry and lawlessness along the U.S.-Mexico border persisted until both nations deployed military force to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to ease as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. (p. 109), and ultimately subsided as the U.S.'s goals shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the latter half of the 19th century.",
            "It's been nearly two decades since my life took an unforeseen turn. At the time, I was a dedicated nurse, driven by a lifelong quest for stability and security. As I navigated adolescence, a recurring message echoed in my mind: \"You'll always find employment.\" This mantra, though well-intentioned, steered me away from my true aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist. Thus, I pursued a career in nursing, a field that offered a sense of predictability.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans. I found myself at 46, single, and financially strained, with a disabling condition that rendered me unable to work. Fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability benefits have left me with little to call my own. Each day is a struggle, testing my resilience and self-worth. It's a battle that I wouldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my loved ones and a handful of trusted friends. Their aid has been a beacon of hope in dark times, reminding me that even in the face of adversity, I'm not alone.\n\nThe experience has taught me a valuable lesson: life's unpredictability is undeniable. No matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to overcome solo. I firmly believe that we, as a nation, must acknowledge this reality and work towards a more cohesive, supportive community.\n\nWhile it's essential to be self-sufficient, I disagree with the notion that we should solely rely on individual efforts. America's resilience in the past wasn't built on isolationism, but rather on collective compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who braved the treacherous trails to the West Coast didn't achieve their goals alone; they relied on the help of their communities.\n\nPreparing for the unexpected is crucial. I've taken steps to ensure my preparedness, equipping myself with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a small cache of essential items. If possible, cultivating a self-sufficient lifestyle through gardening or preserving food can be a valuable asset. However, it's equally important to foster meaningful relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors.\n\nBy acknowledging our vulnerabilities and embracing a spirit of mutual support, we can create a stronger, more resilient society.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a subject of ongoing inquiry. While D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that the definition of organic forms in mathematical language is a distant goal still holds true today, recent advancements in mathematical modeling have led to the application of theoretical frameworks to mollusk skeletogenesis. A study currently underway is exploring the potential of mathematical modeling in combination with experimental research to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. This investigation employs X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative characteristics that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters are then fed into the computational program CerioShell, developed by Stone in 1995. Hypothetical shell morphologies are generated to inform the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, which are subsequently integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to deepen our understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a toroidal structure that traverses a 360-degree arc through space over time. The whorls, or spiral turns of the shell, are considered to revolve around an imaginary axis, referred to as the columella, which passes through the central column of the shell. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line, or suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The standard orientation is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this reference point, with estimates rounded to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be regarded as a series of openings that traverse space and time as the animal constructs its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening and the horizontal and vertical radius, it is possible to chart the shell's trajectory. This trajectory can be mathematically formulated and represented graphically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be manipulated to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "A stagnant neonatal and infant mortality rate has persisted in Indonesia for the past decade, despite progress in other Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets. While the country has made strides in certain areas, including a notable increase in births attended by skilled health workers – now accounting for 72% – the related improvements are mitigated by the fact that traditional workers, like midwives, cannot provide medical interventions in complicated cases, resulting in a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. The data also reveals a concerning trend of declining treatment rates for diarrheal cases in children under five by health professionals, as well as incomplete postnatal care data, suggesting a pressing need for improvement. Cesarean section rates are unacceptably low, at around 4%, and exacerbate a broader issue: unequal access to healthcare across the country, with a stark urban-rural divide. The healthcare access gap between the poorest and richest quintiles stands at 27%, underscoring the difficulties faced by the disadvantaged in accessing essential services, largely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering solutions, the primary challenge lies in effectively addressing the shortage of healthcare services. Essentially, the question is whether Indonesia should focus on strengthening its overall health system, or adopt a more targeted approach by developing program-specific interventions. While the latter, known as vertical approaches, can yield faster results by targeting specific sectors and objectives, it also carries drawbacks. Significant investments in one area of the health sector can divert resources away from other crucial areas and lead to a brain drain towards the more resourced sectors. Furthermore, multiple parallel programs can result in duplication of services, uncoordinated efforts, and an excessive administrative burden.",
            "The distinctive hallmark of Victorian literature lies in its meticulous attention to minute details and a preoccupation with the nobility of the era.  However, two notable exceptions to this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of enigma and a flair for the unconventional, unusual in the literature of the time.  This unusual approach lends depth to the characters, providing profound insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates the labyrinthine world of Fagin's underworld, he becomes increasingly beset by a maelstrom of disorienting thoughts and visions.  His mind is assaulted by the cacophony of Sikes and Crackit's contentious argument, and he finds himself trapped in a surreal realm where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur.  The staccato bursts of gunfire and the eerie cries of the crowd serve to further disorient him, as an unseen force propels him through a nightmarish landscape of pain and despair.\n\nIn Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the authors employ dream sequences and dreamlike states to heighten the sense of mystery and unease.  In the case of Oliver Twist, these episodes often serve as a window into the protagonist's inner world, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities that surround him.  The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28 is a prime example of this, as Oliver relives the traumatic event in vivid detail, his senses numbed by the sheer horror of it all.  The passage conveys Oliver's overwhelming sense of powerlessness in the face of his circumstances, as he is borne away by an unseen force, his emotions mired in a quagmire of fear and pain.\n\nThe shooting sequence serves to underscore the notion that Oliver is a pawn in a larger game, with forces beyond his control dictating the course of his life.  As he struggles to find solace in the face of his dire circumstances, Oliver's growing sense of defeat is palpable, as if he has been irreparably broken by the cruel hand of fate.  The passage implies that Oliver's inability to exert control over his own life is a hallmark of his character, a testament to the crushing power of his circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile, in Wuthering Heights, the author employs a similar technique to create a sense of disorientation and unease.  The passage from the novel reads: \"The day passed off – day!  There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A pivotal experience I had several years ago has had a lasting impact on my perspective on the challenges faced by students in elementary education. I was involved with an after-school program that provided academic support to students of varying skill levels, with a particular focus on those struggling in specific subjects. As an individual with strengths in English and reading, I was approached by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading difficulties. Initially, I noticed that his reading issues were particularly puzzling, as he demonstrated a good understanding of certain letter pronunciation while struggling with others. This peculiar phenomenon was further complicated by the fact that Adrian's mother, who accompanied him to the program, communicated primarily in Spanish.\n\nDuring a moment of clarity, it became apparent that Adrian's difficulties stemmed from his lack of familiarity with the English alphabet, rather than any deficiency in reading comprehension. This realization sparked a sense of urgency to find a suitable solution. Although I am uncertain whether this epiphany had a lasting impact on Adrian's academic trajectory, I hope that he has made significant progress since then.\n\nThis anecdote serves as a poignant reminder of the language barrier that exists in educational settings, particularly in multicultural environments like California. It highlights the need for creative solutions to address this issue. While some may assume that students who speak English fluently are not affected by reading challenges, this is far from the truth. In fact, even for those who possess native-like proficiency in the language, reading can still pose a significant obstacle.\n\nIn the case of Adrian, a tailored approach involving targeted English reading instruction, specifically focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved to be an effective solution. However, for students who are non-native English speakers, the solution is far more complex. A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be successful, as each child's needs are unique. A combination of strategies, including bilingual education, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and others, is essential.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, holds great promise. Research has shown that children participating in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and the potential lack of benefits for majority-language students, these fears are unfounded. Implementing dual language programs as a standard practice, rather than an exception, would yield benefits for all students. The question remains, however, how to implement this in a practical manner. Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is unrealistic, but providing bilingual support staff, such as tutors or aides, is a viable solution. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment that meets the diverse needs of all students.",
            "The notion that there exists something beyond our mortal grasp has been a recurring theme throughout human history.  From early childhood, we are exposed to various belief systems that aim to fill the void left by our limited understanding.  For some, this involves formal instruction in places of worship, while others may seek answers within or adopt the faith of their forebears.  However, not everyone conforms to these preconceived notions, often rejecting them in favor of a more individualized worldview.  This existential search for meaning is a deeply personal journey, as individuals strive to define themselves through their unique perspectives on spirituality.  It is in these moments of introspection that we seek illumination, yearning to transcend the darkness and find solace in the light.\n\nMy father's gaze drifted aimlessly into the rain-soaked evening, a mixture of contemplation and reminiscence etched on his face.  We sat together on the worn porch, the rhythmic beat of the raindrops on the tin roof creating a melancholic melody.  His usually robust frame had thinned, and his hair had begun to recede, accentuating the gaunt lines of his face.  As we silently shared a cigarette, I felt an unspoken sense of unease, as if acknowledging the impending loss would only make it more poignant.  I reached out, embracing him in a gesture of affection, and we both became lost in the somber beauty of the June twilight.\n\nTragically, we lost him in December, just five days shy of my twenty-second birthday.  The treatments had prolonged his life, but at what cost?  I couldn't help but wonder whether such suffering had any redeeming value.  As the darkness closed in, I found myself questioning the existence of a higher power, wondering if it had abandoned me.  In the still of the night, I chose not to seek solace in prayer, instead leaving my thoughts unspoken.  If a deity existed, I reasoned, it had long since tuned out my pleas.\n\nI opted not to witness his final moments, unable to bear the thought of watching the man who had given me life slip away.  I wanted to remember him in the vibrant, living person he was, not in his final, fading breaths.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I was confident that he would have wanted me to cherish the memories of our time together, rather than being by his side as he left this world.  For three days, I retreated into a cocoon of grief, waiting for the news that would change my life forever.  The silence was deafening, a stark reminder that, even in my darkest hour, I was left to confront my sorrow alone.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is often seen as an oxymoronic blend of the old and the new, as 18th-century literary critic Ian Watt noted in his work on the genre. Throughout the centuries, the Gothic mode has been subject to both scathing critique and fervent praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others seeing it as a masterclass in evoking the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). At its inception, the Gothic novel drew inspiration from a fusion of ancient romance and modern literary techniques. The pioneering \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, exemplified this merging of old and new by incorporating traditional theatrical elements and naturalistic narrative styles. Walpole's work, which he termed a \"Gothic Story,\" (Walpole 4) laid the groundwork for the genre, blending medieval themes, theatrical conventions, and architectural motifs with the emerging format of the novel. The term \"gothic\" itself was initially used to describe various cultures, styles, and eras, often with negative connotations, implying a lack of sophistication. The juxtaposition of the theatrical, antiquated \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative narrative structure allowed it to endure and remain relevant across time, simultaneously appearing both outdated and fresh to readers separated from the original work.\n\nA key element of the Gothic novel is the concept of chivalry, a medieval ideal of knighthood that Walpole's work preserves and reinterprets. Chivalry, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and competence, held significant cultural significance, particularly for writers like Walpole who perceived a decline in these values in their contemporary society. Through the use of chivalric motifs and ideals, the Gothic novel idealized and romanticized the past, foreshadowing the development of the Romantic movement. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's portrayal of characters like Frederic, a prince who embodies traditional chivalric virtues, serves as a prime example of this phenomenon. Frederic's description, which highlights his nobility, suffering, and gallantry, exemplifies the exaggerated chivalric ideal, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management is a multifaceted process that encompasses the logistical movement of goods from procurement to delivery, thereby ensuring seamless service to customers. This concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the intricacies of supply chain operations as a holistic process geared towards efficient and timely delivery. The six core components of supply chain management serve as the foundation for providing exceptional customer service.\n\nKey elements include production, supply, inventory management, distribution, transportation, and information management. By effectively utilizing these components, businesses can establish themselves as reliable service providers.\n\nThe production phase represents the initial stage of the supply chain, laying the groundwork for subsequent processes. To initiate production, it is essential for managers to comprehend customer demands, which can be gauged through market analysis. By understanding market trends, businesses can make informed decisions regarding product offerings and production quantities. The next step involves determining the optimal production location and facilities, taking into account factors such as product quality, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.\n\nOnce the production location has been established, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. A well-planned production process is crucial to avoiding potential delays and costs. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have implemented detailed processes and procedures to ensure a smooth operational workflow, minimizing confusion and maintaining high productivity.\n\nSupply is the second critical element in supply chain management, encompassing strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Businesses may choose to divide production into multiple divisions to cater to diverse product requirements. Managers must select the most suitable division for each process, considering factors such as equipment, personnel, and specialties. Outsourcing is another option, often employed to enhance velocity – the capacity to deliver quality products while minimizing costs.",
            "The claim that a notorious historical figure is alive in a Southeast Asian nation, now known as Myanmar, is nonsensically emblazoned on a makeshift sign held aloft by Ellen Page, a prominent actress known for her role in the film Juno. The stark contrast between her solitary figure on a street corner and the ominous message on her placard, scrawled in bold marker strokes, is a jarring juxtaposition. Myanmar, a country in the region, has been subject to a repressive military regime since 1962, following a coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests swept through the nation, driven in part by Buddhist monks and earning the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution,\" a nod to the distinctive robes worn by these monks. The protests, initially peaceful, eventually escalated into violent confrontations between the monks and the military junta, with the latter resorting to brutal suppression, including the ransacking of monasteries and the imprisonment of foreign journalists. The death toll, officially reported as 13, is disputed, with Colonel Hla Win, a former military officer, estimating that the true number of fatalities is in the thousands.\n\nThis disturbing phenomenon, however, is not unique to Myanmar. Throughout history, governments have consistently sought to maintain their authority and crush dissent, often with tragic consequences. Ancient Roman leaders, for instance, claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were revered as deities. In more recent times, we see parallels in the actions of authoritarian leaders, such as the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, where peaceful protesters were met with brutal force, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderates. The persecution of Jews during World War II, orchestrated by the Nazi regime, is another egregious example.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his impressive career span and demonstrated ability to shape his ensemble's artistic direction. Although his piano playing is often understated in the selected pieces, as a master composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and varied musical pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. By establishing a framework for improvisation and incorporating precisely orchestrated passages that highlighted the unique styles of each musician, Ellington successfully brought out the distinctive tone of his orchestra. His understanding of the unique timbres and interactions of his ensemble members enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's pioneering use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in his career, exemplified by Creole Love Call. This innovative approach involved incorporating voice as a textural element, free from the constraints of traditional lyrics. Creole Love Call, an early piece, exemplifies Ellington's ability to enhance the style of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. This twelve-bar blues piece, characterized by a slow and deliberate pace, features six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response pattern is established between the vocalist and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth to rougher textures towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, emphasizing extended notes and chromaticism.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo soars in the upper register, accompanied by a subtle piano ostinato.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble echoes the first chorus, replicating the call-and-response dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climax of the piece occurs as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high range, backed by syncopated stop-time rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: The structure of the first chorus is revisited, with the vocalist adopting a growl technique, soloing as a virtuosic instrument.\nA brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, rounding out the piece.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a means of adding tonal depth to Creole Love Call is reflective of a hallmark of his compositional style.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington skillfully combines his expertise in orchestration with his keen sense of timbre. The song features a call-and-response exchange between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, effectively blurring the lines between vocal and instrumental elements. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "A nagging void had always gnawed at her, a feeling that persisted despite her best efforts to satiate it. It began to manifest when she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of adolescence. Now, at 17, this unfulfilled longing still lingered, albeit with a subtle shift in focus - from an intangible something to a specific someone. Yet, her interactions with boys had yielded no spark, and she found herself bewildered by this peculiarity. As she pondered this enigma, theories began to surface, but none proved convincing enough to allay her doubts. As a result, she continued to live a life of introspection and questioning.\n\nOrdinarily, her days at home were marked by a sense of serenity, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. Her parents' relationship was characterized by a remarkable absence of conflict, and arguments with their daughter were rare. Their disagreements typically revolved around her strong will and independent nature, which often served as a counterpoint to their tranquil energies. Her unique blend of a lively personality and kind heart made her a likable and well-liked individual.\n\nHowever, today was an exception. As she roamed the house in search of inspiration, she was startled by a faint cry from the kitchen and the unmistakable timbre of her mother's voice. Her heart racing, she sprinted towards the source of the sound and found her mother lying on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, her voice laced with alarm. Upon closer inspection, she noticed her mother's labored breathing and urgent entreaties to get her to the hospital. The daughter sprang into action, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder and asking for directions. \"Okay, Mom, where can I take you?\" she asked, trying to keep her composure. Her mother's instructions were hasty and pained, but she managed to decipher them. The daughter quickly lifted her mother and carried her to the car, carefully placing her in the back seat before driving off.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the familiar scent of disinfectant and the hum of anxious chatter enveloped her. Yet, her focus remained fixed on her mother's well-being, and she darted into action, calling out for medical assistance. A team of worried faces soon gathered, and someone hastened to bring a gurney to the stricken woman. The doctors quickly took her in for evaluation, leaving her daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had taken a tumble while attempting to retrieve a vase from the top shelf of a step stool.",
            "This investigation aimed to examine the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, evaluates the consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. The diet also permits moderate alcohol intake.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, a controlled trial found that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, no prior research has specifically focused on the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis prospective cohort study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, food frequency questionnaires, which assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year, were completed six times. The questionnaires were validated through medical record reviews and were found to be reliable. Self-reported cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, probable cases were included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo reduce individual variability and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated by averaging scores from the preceding two years. The analysis controlled for potential confounders, including age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study examined the association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke. The results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet score had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The financial downturn that beset the United States in 2007 was a catastrophic event with far-reaching implications for the nation's economy. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the devastating consequences for several leading corporations exemplified the gravity of the situation. To prevent such a catastrophe from occurring again, it is essential to examine the factors that contributed to this economic downturn and identify potential solutions to mitigate its effects. The root cause of the crisis was a series of misguided policy decisions that led to the proliferation of sub-prime lending in a fragile financial system.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, under the Clinton administration, lending regulations were relaxed to increase homeownership rates among low- and moderate-income households. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the administration to expand its lending activities and from shareholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the potential consequences of these actions, stating, \"The government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\" Unfortunately, his forecast proved accurate.\n\nThe complex web of mortgage products that emerged in the years leading up to the crisis played a significant role in exacerbating the situation. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to a situation in which U.S. households and financial markets became increasingly vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in housing prices.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The consequences were severe: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at deeply discounted prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to undergo significant regulatory reforms. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The perils of exposition: a writer's nemesis, a reader's barrier.  It's the moment when the author's wings spread wide, only to find themselves stuck in the quicksand of unnecessary detail, suffocating the very story they sought to tell.  Even the most seasoned wordsmiths, like Dr. Merlin, can fall prey to the temptation of Too Much Information, their frustration evident in the muttered curses at their screens.\n\nWhile we've all heard the advice to \"Show, don't tell,\" it's a mantra that's easier to preach than practice.  Exposition can be a seductive siren, luring the author into the waters of tedious description and exposition, where the story's momentum falters and the reader's attention wanes.\n\nIn essence, exposition is the act of conveying information directly to the audience, often through straightforward prose.  In film, it manifests as the \"info dump,\" a cinematic cliche exemplified by \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, it's the author's equivalent, where the narrative is bogged down by unnecessary explanations.\n\nConsider a hypothetical example: a heroine meets her love interest, they get married, and he's brutally murdered in front of her.  A two-page summary of this sequence would likely leave readers uninvested, with both characters relegated to mere footnotes.  A more effective approach would be to delve into the husband's character, revealing his depth through his words and actions.  This would allow readers to connect with his fate and, by extension, the heroine's emotional response.  By fleshing out the narrative, you create a richer, more immersive experience for the reader.\n\nIn other words, a good story needs more substance than its bare bones.  A simple \"They met, they married, he died\" won't cut it.  As a writer, it's your job to add the meat to the bones, to make the narrative more relatable and engaging.  Sometimes, it's easy to get carried away with the details, but it's crucial to resist the urge to info-dump.  Consider the example of a character with a military background, now working as a gas station manager.  Rather than listing his entire backstory, you could subtly weave these details into the narrative, revealing his personality and motivations through his actions and dialogue.  By doing so, you'll create a more nuanced character and a more engaging story.",
            "This morning, I watched a pair of news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, dated August 13, 2011. The first was a live NBC 4 broadcast. The lead story focused on a violent incident in Ashley, Ohio, in which a man named Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife; her identity was not disclosed. The news team displayed his mug shot, which appeared to convey a sense of foreboding. Given the developing nature of the story, the coverage was relatively brief, lasting around two minutes. I believe the time allocated was suitable.\n\nThe second story reported on an early morning shooting that occurred in the Sharon Woods area, involving an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers. He was shot and critically injured, but no arrests had been made at the time of the broadcast. The SWAT Team was investigating the incident. This story seemed concise, and it's possible that the brevity was due to the fact that it involved a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. It's worth noting that crime stories involving minority victims often receive limited media attention, whereas high-profile cases involving white victims tend to dominate the headlines.\n\nThe following story addressed a mysterious gunshot wound that damaged a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided details about the incident's location and concluded that a .22 caliber rifle bullet was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension.\n\nAnother story highlighted the impending severe weather, including thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to remain in the mid to low 80s throughout the weekend. While the segment was brief, it served as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAdditionally, the broadcast covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned man wearing a hoodie, was reported to be approximately 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. The news team devoted an unexpected amount of airtime to highlighting the perpetrator's skin color.\n\nLastly, the broadcast featured a report on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation between Texas and Ohio. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. While it's not clear why the news team chose to specify the sentence in this manner, it's worth noting that mentioning his Hispanic heritage seemed tangential to the story.",
            "In the complex web of relationships between siblings, a unique dynamic unfolds. The bond between brothers is multifaceted, encompassing a range of emotions that often contradict one another. These contrasting feelings of love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty can be palpable, as brothers come to understand each other in a way that transcends the connections they share with others. When the stakes are high, the true nature of this bond is revealed, often in its most profound and unsettling forms. The consequences of this complex emotional landscape can be far-reaching, requiring those who navigate it to confront the costs of their actions.\n\nA poignant example of this dynamic can be seen in the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" Set against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, the story follows two brothers on a journey marked by both hope and heartbreak. In a climactic scene, the tension between bitter disappointment and intense pride comes to a head, resulting in a tragic outcome. Through the protagonist's character and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, the novel skillfully conveys the intricate emotions that shape the protagonist's world.\n\nAt its core, the protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, his relationship with his younger brother, Doodle, is marked by a sense of disillusionment and frustration. The protagonist had envisioned a different kind of brotherhood, one in which he could share his skills and experiences with someone who could keep pace with him. However, Doodle's health issues render such a partnership impossible, forcing the protagonist to confront the harsh reality of his brother's limitations. This sense of disappointment and anger eventually gives way to a more profound recognition of his brother's value, as evidenced by his conflicted thoughts about Doodle's well-being. The complexity of his emotions is particularly evident in his recollections of considering a tragic act, which ultimately reveals the depth of his love and compassion for his brother. The episode serves as a powerful reminder that even the most contradictory emotions can coexist within us, and that our true character is often revealed in the choices we make.",
            "The human brain is a complex, dynamic information-processing entity that has been the subject of various analogies and comparisons as technology has evolved. Initially, it was likened to a primitive recording surface, followed by a scroll, and more recently, to a sophisticated processing system. It is essential to recognize the limitations of these analogies, which can lead to oversimplification and inaccuracies in understanding the brain's functionality.\n\nInformation processing commences with sensory input from organs, which transmute physical stimuli such as tactile sensations, thermal fluctuations, sound waves, or light particles into electrical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly reconfigured through both ascending and descending processing pathways. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black rectangle on a white background, ascending processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and the object's borders – where the color changes notably over a short distance – to conclude that you are perceiving a rectangle. Descending processing utilizes the decisions made at intermediate stages of the ascending process to expedite your recognition of the rectangle. Descending processing in this example might facilitate identifying the object as a black rectangle rather than a rectangular void in the white background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain degree, a selective filter determines its significance and allocates it to pertinent cognitive processes. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, a healthy selective filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results of processing are subject to modulation by selective attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first be stored. There exist various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with encoding methods specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded in terms of its visual appearance, phonetic structure, or semantic meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Certain animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal circulating through a particular series of neurons for a brief period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained in the arrangement of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized within the brain, some grounded in human subjects' memory retrieval patterns, others based on computer science principles, and others rooted in neurophysiological considerations. The conceptual network model posits that there are nodes representing abstract concepts, and that these nodes are connected based on their relatedness. For example, in a conceptual network, \"furniture\" might be linked to \"chair,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, presents a thought-provoking critique of the intersecting threats of emerging technology and capitalist ideologies. The novel's society, driven by a relentless pursuit of instant gratification, prioritizes communal harmony over individual freedom and autonomy. From a young age, its citizens are conditioned to conform to societal norms, perpetuating a cycle of consumption and obedience.\n\nBy examining the text through the lens of Marxist theory, it becomes evident that Huxley is cautioning against the dangers of systemic control and manipulation. Key concepts like homogenization and reification are woven throughout the narrative, underscoring the author's concerns about the burgeoning capitalist system of his time. The novel's satirical portrayal of consumer culture and the exploitation of the working class is particularly striking, as exemplified by the use of Marxist notions such as false consciousness.\n\nThe concept of false consciousness is exemplified in the novel's portrayal of the lower classes, who are kept in a state of ignorance regarding their true relationships with the ruling elite. This is achieved through the use of hypnopædia, which reinforces a desire for consumption and indulgence above all else. The ruling class, meanwhile, exercises hegemony over the lower classes, maintaining their dominance through a complex web of social and economic control.\n\nThe novel's exploration of social relationships is also telling, as it reveals a society devoid of genuine connections and emotional depth. Interactions between characters are superficial, with a focus on physical appearance and material possessions rather than meaningful human experience. This is particularly evident in the way men discuss women, reducing them to mere objects of admiration, while women's conversations revolve around their physical encounters.\n\nThe characters' complacency with their assigned roles in society serves as a poignant commentary on the effects of capitalist ideology. Their unwavering obedience to the status quo is a testament to the ways in which systemic control can erode individual autonomy and freedom. In this sense, Huxley's novel can be seen as a scathing critique of the ways in which capitalist systems can perpetuate social and economic inequality.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, navigating the campus terrain has proven to be a consistent challenge. For many, myself included, traversing the grounds can be a time-consuming endeavor. Initially residing in an East Halls dorm, situated towards the eastern fringes of the campus, I would often find myself trekking to classes in more centrally located buildings like the Willard complex, a journey that could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when inclement weather made the conditions unfavorable. In speaking with an alumnus of similar age, I discovered that the East Halls residence halls were once physically separated from the main campus by extensive vacant land. Subsequently, the now-congested area has been transformed with the addition of sports facilities, new buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and surrounding apartment complexes. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly complicated. The most practical solution to this issue is the bicycle, yet its efficacy relies on not only its presence but also the campus's infrastructure and student participation.\n\nA conversation with a friend who had resumed cycling after a few years of hiatus shed light on the benefits of this mode of transportation. He reflected, \"Bikes are excellent, it wasn't cool to ride them for a period, but they're the best way to get around.\" In addition to providing physical benefits, cycling is an efficient means of transportation, allowing one to cover significant distances on a minimal amount of energy. Like many of my peers, I now reside off-campus, which is just as far from the central campus area as some dorms. Acquiring a bike was one of the most intelligent decisions I made this year. With daily classes in Thomas building, easily a 25-minute walk from my home, cycling can reduce the travel time to just 5 minutes if I pedal at a moderate pace. However, navigating Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, can be hazardous, regardless of the mode of transportation. While walking has its merits, I barely have enough time to attend to my academic responsibilities, let alone walk to classes. If I didn't own a bike, walking would be my sole reliable means of transportation, which would entail an additional 2.5 hours of walking time each week. Considering the time required to walk to and from classes, appointments, and other obligations, this time commitment is unsustainable for me."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My academic and professional aspirations are focused on becoming a social worker within the Division of Family and Children Services. This career path will enable me to make a meaningful impact in the lives of children who have been affected by abuse or neglect, as well as provide support to families in need. Key values that I aim to bring to the field of social work include a commitment to service, respect, and upholding the highest ethical standards. These values are not only essential for a social worker, but also deeply ingrained in my personal identity.\n\nThroughout my educational journey, I have been driven by a desire to contribute to the well-being of others, although it took some time to pinpoint my career goals. In high school and college, I witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of individuals turning a blind eye to their problems or resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms. My academic background in Psychology at Piedmont College provided a solid foundation for understanding human behavior, but I still felt uncertain about my career path. Following graduation in 2009, I took a break to reflect on my options. A pivotal moment came when I visited a friend's home, where a 16-year-old boy was seeking refuge from an abusive situation. My friend explained the gravity of the situation, and the next day, I learned that the boy had reached out to the authorities. I offered to support the police in their efforts to address the situation, drawing on my Psychology degree to engage with the parents in a constructive manner. Their defensive behavior and lack of accountability left a lasting impression on me, solidifying my resolve to pursue a career in social work.\n\nAnother fundamental value that resonates with me is the importance of social justice. Our society often extols the virtues of individuality, yet seems to encourage conformity in practice. This paradox has always puzzled me. If we value the uniqueness of each person, why do we often prioritize blending in over standing out? My personal experiences have taught me the importance of challenging social norms and advocating for what is right. Throughout my high school and college years, I actively engaged in various initiatives promoting social justice, including participating in the GSBA (Gay, Straight, Bisexual Alliance) and speaking out against racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it. I firmly believe in the power of social justice and will continue to be an advocate for change.",
            "This paper delves into the intricacies of insomnia, exploring the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors that contribute to this complex disorder. The biological model, rooted in genetics and medical aspects, seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms driving sleep disturbances. In contrast, the sociocultural model examines the environmental influences of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status on sleep patterns. This review aims to scrutinize existing research related to these models, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses while shedding light on the complexities of insomnia.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized into primary sleep disorders, which include Dyssonmias and Parasomnias, as well as sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions or medical complications. Dyssonmias encompass Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified. Primary Insomnia is characterized by persistent difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, while Primary Hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy is marked by cataplexy and/or automatic REM sleep episodes. Conversely, Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with abnormal behaviors or physiological occurrences, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders linked to mental health conditions involve difficulties related to Clinical Disorders (Axis I) or Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation (Axis II). This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to primary sleep disorders within the context of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders investigates the roles of genetics, heritability, and physiological factors in sleep disturbances. Recent research has identified neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin, which regulate sleep and wakefulness. A study involving mice revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which play a crucial role in sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor promotes sleep, while inhibition of the receptor reduces anxiety and induces sleep. The GABAB agonist, baclofen, increased sleep duration in mice, suggesting a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. This finding implies that an alteration or absence of this receptor could impact an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are twofold: if the phenotype is inherited, it could regulate sleep patterns, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disrupt sleep, potentially affecting various aspects of daily life, including academic and professional performance, as well as routine tasks that demand focus and attention.",
            "The auditory processing abilities of individuals with Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) are the focus of this paper. To begin, the fundamental characteristics of the disorder are examined. Following that, the diagnostic process is discussed, highlighting key indicators and warning signs. Finally, practical strategies are presented for supporting students with CAPD in inclusive educational settings.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), is a condition in which the brain struggles to interpret and process sound information efficiently. According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), CAPD refers to the brain's impaired ability to decode and distinguish auditory information, resulting from an underlying neurobiological issue affecting the central nervous system. Individuals with CAPD may possess normal hearing acuity, yet their brains fail to effectively separate and differentiate sounds, conversations, or background noise. This impairment in auditory processing does not signify hearing loss, but rather, an issue with the cognitive processing of auditory data.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has its roots in the mid-1950s, when researchers initially identified \"auditory imperception\" as a communicative disorder in children (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The pioneering work of Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari in 1954 laid the groundwork for developing diagnostic tools, while Kimura's introduction of dichotic testing and a physiological model in 1961 further advanced the understanding of the condition (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 served as a catalyst for subsequent research on CAPD in children.\n\nIndividuals with CAPD often exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulties with sound localization, distinguishing between multiple sounds, recognizing sound patterns, detecting changes in speech, and processing auditory information in sequence. They may also experience auditory masking, where one sound is overwhelmed by another, or have trouble integrating sound cues to inform their actions.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation typically involves systematic observation of listening behavior, as well as performance on various tests of auditory function, conducted by audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other specialists (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). These assessments may include questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory responses to specific stimuli. While no single test or tool is universally effective in diagnosis, a combination of these methods is often employed to identify the disorder. Advanced assessments may involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the brain's response to these signals.",
            "There is a theme in Twelfth Night that suggests a gap between the efficacy of deception and the consequences that follow it. The play implies that while disguise can successfully conceal intentions for a considerable period, ultimately, one must shed the disguise or risk losing their sense of self. However, abandoning deception is complicated by the potential for alienation from others. In some cases, those discovering the deception might remain neutral, but others are likely to react adversely, their feelings ranging from annoyance to offense.\n\nThe play's treatment of gender role reversal is particularly complex due to the various issues it raises. One of the most significant concerns is the motivation behind adopting a disguise. In Twelfth Night, Viola resorts to disguising herself as a man to protect herself from potential threats. As she navigates her new environment, she finds her disguise effective in safeguarding her, yet it also isolates her from her female peers, depriving her of a vital support system. Furthermore, her convincing performance as a man leads to confusion between her and her twin brother, Sebastian, as Olivia becomes enamored with the male persona, as seen in her declaration: \"Cesario, husband, stay\" (5.1.138). Viola also grapples with the suppression of her romantic feelings for Orsino, to whom she is forced to express platonic sentiments: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me\" (5.1.260-261).\n\nTwelfth Night may be viewed as a case study of how deception can facilitate the acknowledgment of repressed emotions, particularly in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages hint at the possibility that these characters may harbor unconscious desires, which are brought to the surface by Viola's presence. However, the likelihood of Olivia being attracted to women is diminished by her subsequent shift in affections towards Sebastian, where she begins to regard Viola as a sibling rather than a romantic interest: \"A sister, you are she\" (5.1.315). This change in behavior suggests that Olivia is, in fact, a satirical representation of the societal norms prevalent during Shakespeare's time, where judgments were often made based on superficial appearances.",
            "Observations of the German colonial regime have highlighted stark contrasts, most notably the devastating impact on the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, such a broad description simplifies the complexities of the colonial empire, which exhibited a multifaceted nature in its policies and governance styles, as well as its geography. The provision of education across the colonies was equally diverse, with various outcomes evident in different territories. When the British took over German East Africa in 1919, they found a sizable population with a high level of literacy and education. Similarly, German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies garnered praise from contemporary authors.\n\nIn contrast, South West Africa, now part of Namibia, presented a striking disparity. In stark contrast to East Africa, where the government played a significant role in education, the South West African case saw the primary responsibility for native education fall onto missionary societies, which received limited government backing. The government, however, invested considerable resources in the education of Europeans, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support for missionary institutions. This dichotomy had far-reaching implications for South West Africa, which persisted even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted considerable numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa, a substantial majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. Various interlocking factors, including social, political, and economic considerations, contributed to this divergence. This research aims to expand the current discussion by identifying these factors and examining new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans.\n\nThe existing literature on education in the German colonial empire is substantial, with many sources in German and dating back to the early twentieth century. Most of these studies focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies. Later works, written in English, built upon earlier research by conducting comparative studies of education in different German colonies and providing more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant differences in the educational systems of distinct colonies. A notable work that explicitly addresses the topic of this research is Cohen's comparative study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen contrasts the educational systems of the two colonies, examining the factors that contributed to their divergent development. According to Cohen, the significant settler population in South West Africa explains many of the defining features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to Germany's other colonial possessions, South West Africa possessed a relatively temperate climate, despite the predominance of arid desert landscapes. The European population of South West Africa reflected the favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 whites residing in the colony by 1913, a figure significantly higher than in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa, which had approximately 5,336 residents.",
            "The trajectory of popular music over the past century has been marked by an exponential proliferation of genres, rendering a definitive classification increasingly challenging. Moreover, numerous genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have given rise to a multitude of sub-genres, further complicating the landscape. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most dynamic and expressive genres in the past four decades. Characterized by its capacity to convey a wide range of emotions, albeit predominantly darker and more intense, heavy metal has demonstrated an impressive ability to evolve and branch out into various sub-genres.\n\nToday, the heavy metal movement has fragmented into numerous niches, making it difficult to pinpoint a unified definition of the genre. As a result of its malleability, heavy metal has assimilated elements from various styles, yet its origins remain a crucial aspect of understanding its current diversity. To grasp the essence of modern metal music, it is essential to first comprehend the historical context and the underlying factors that have shaped the movement.\n\nHeavy metal can be regarded as a movement defined by its affinity for the darker aspects of human experience. It is often associated with a heightened sensory experience, characterized by increased volume, intensity, and theatricality. In contrast to more primitive forms of music, heavy metal musicians tend to exhibit exceptional technical proficiency, which is deeply ingrained in the genre. Furthermore, the influence of psychedelic substances in the 1970s contributed to the creation of pioneering works that blurred the lines between reality and fantasy. The genre's affinity for the darker, more visceral qualities has been shaped by the Romantic Era's emphasis on emotional intensity. Examples of lyrics, such as those found in Helter Skelter, exemplify the genre's propensity for exploring the darker aspects of the human experience.\n\nHelter Skelter, a song by the Beatles, marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of heavy metal. This song's dark and unpredictable tone, often attributed to the use of psychedelic substances, was a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier and darker work. The Beatles' intention was to demonstrate their capacity to rival the Stones' sonic intensity, as evidenced by the song's inclusion on the White Album.",
            "It was not the Surrealist movement that first brought dreamlike qualities to the forefront of art. Instead, a distinct figure emerged decades prior, crafting works that would soon mirror his innermost desires. Henri Rousseau's 1910 masterpiece, The Dream, serves as a poignant representation of his own journey – a testament to both his personal aspirations and the internal conflict that defined his career. As he navigated the art world, Rousseau grappled with a dilemma: to conform to established styles and gain recognition, or to forge his own path and risk rejection.\n\nTo fully appreciate The Dream, one must first delve into the artist's backstory. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, northwest France, Rousseau's early life was marked by a sense of stability. His father, a successful tinsmith and hardware dealer, provided a comfortable upbringing. However, Rousseau's journey into the arts was unconventional. Without formal training, he began his career as a municipal toll service employee, earning the nickname douanier, or customs inspector, despite this being a misnomer. The tragic loss of his first wife, Clémence, and their eight infant children, left him with a single child, Julia, and a profound sense of grief. Painting became a source of solace, allowing him to rebuild his life and find new purpose.\n\nAs a folk painter, Rousseau's work diverged from the romanticized portrayals of peasants common among his contemporaries. His art reflected the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class. Rousseau's desire for acceptance by the art world was rooted in his circumstances: he began his career late in life, untrained, and contemporaneous with other prominent artists. Despite years of work, recognition eluded him until the rise of Matisse, a fellow modern artist. Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters that while Rousseau and Matisse were technically competitors, their motivations differed fundamentally: \"Matisse feared the triteness of painting, while Rousseau sought to create a picture so conventional it would secure him a place among the Artiste Français.\"",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has been a long-standing topic of interest among philosophers and thinkers. I propose that the connection between these two concepts lies in their fundamental nature. As John Keats so eloquently puts it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" Our understanding of the world is shaped by education and experience, yet our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional means of acquisition. Both ethics and aesthetics are descriptive pursuits, aiming to elucidate rather than prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty often seek to explain why a particular work of art or literature is considered beautiful or moral, rather than providing a set of rules for evaluating or creating such works.\n\nCrucially, criticism and analysis can only capture part of what makes something good or beautiful. A discussion about the merits of the Mona Lisa, for instance, might focus on aspects like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these factors do not fully encapsulate its value. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like \"There's just something about it\" before providing a more nuanced explanation. I believe that both art and morality resist reduction to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, the essence of literature and ethics cannot be fully grasped through analysis or description. Even the most detailed examination of a work's properties leaves a residual aspect that cannot be captured.\n\nThe transcendent quality of both art and morality provides a common ground between them. Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion that ethics is \"transcendental\" – that it cannot be expressed – resonates with my understanding of the relationship between ethics and aesthetics. I propose that this je ne sais quoi, this ineffable quality, is the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This shared characteristic offers a connection point between ethics and aesthetics.\n\nOur experience of both ethics and aesthetics is fundamentally experiential, operating at a level that can be felt but not fully articulated. This is particularly evident in literature, which, as McKean notes, possesses a unique moral quality that sets it apart from other art forms. Literature's ability to engage us on a deep, personal level is rooted in its capacity to convey values that are central to human experience. As McKean suggests, \"Living necessarily involves values... Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "The modern German nation is a dynamic force, with a rich cultural heritage spanning across the country's diverse landscapes, from the Alpine regions around Munich to the Baltic Sea coast in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is also characterized by the Rhineland's Cologne, the central regions, and the Saxon city of Dresden, situated on the Elbe River. Given this unique cultural identity, it is not surprising that Germany's history is the result of a complex blend of influences from various tribes and sources.\n\nGermany's ancestral homeland, Germania, has a disputed etymology. The origins of the name are subject to debate among scholars and historians. The Roman historian Tacitus attributed the name to the Germanic Tungrian tribe, suggesting they were previously known as Germans before their expansion across the Rhine and conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar first used the term \"Germanus\" in his commentary on the Gallic Wars, which described his battles against Germanic tribes that crossed the Rhine, often under ambiguous circumstances. Caesar adopted this term from the Gauls, distinguishing between the conquered and unconquered. In his account of the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes: \"Germans, who reside beyond the Rhine, are in a state of constant conflict with the Gauls.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Some theories propose that the name \"Germany\" is derived from the Gaulish language, referring to a neighboring people. Others suggest a connection to the Old English word \"ger,\" meaning spear, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" which implies a loud or boisterous people.\n\nIn his work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in 98 AD, Tacitus observed that the Germans were an indigenous people, untouched by immigration or external influences. He wrote: \"I consider the Germans to be aboriginal, with no admixture of other races through immigration or cultural exchange. Who would leave Asia or Africa to settle in Germany, with its unforgiving climate and harsh environment, unless it was their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98)\n\nThe Roman Empire's interactions with Germania were largely characterized by conquest and trade. While the Romans did not establish settlements in Germania, they did engage in campaigns to secure resources and goods from the region. Germanic tribes began to appear in the first century, living on the empire's borders and trading their goods and skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "My gaze drifted downwards, my mind receptive yet detached from the scene before me.  Observing the view with a practiced objectivity, I consciously avoided infusing it with abstract meaning, instead allowing my awareness to flow freely, unencumbered by preconceptions.  Thoughts arose and dissipated rapidly, as if they were mere wisps of vapor, leaving no lasting impression.  My mental state seemed akin to a fluid, constantly shifting and adapting to the stimulus, without any fixed reference point.\n\nInspired by an artist I had worked with, I had purchased a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  I had long been fascinated by the idea of drawing, dating back to my early childhood.  This book offered a comprehensive guide, explaining the fundamental principles of perception and the cognitive processes that underlie artistic creation.  One technique it discussed involved isolating a subject by placing a mental frame around it, effectively simplifying the complexities of a scene.  For instance, a detailed still life, such as a bowl of fruit on a kitchen table, could be reduced to a simplified, two-dimensional representation by imposing a square frame on it.\n\nAt that moment, gazing at the bowl in front of me, I found myself unable to mentally impose this frame.  I was overwhelmed by the sheer presence of the bowl, and all I could do was stand there, transfixed.  Great artists, like Picasso and Monet, had their own distinct styles, marked by distinct color palettes – blue, green, and a kaleidoscope of colors, respectively.  If I were to consider myself an artist, perhaps this moment marked the inception of my own unique style, which I would come to call \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, my muscles tensed and relaxed as I began to move, channeling my thoughts into a tangible expression.  Water, serene and crystalline, seemed to flow through my mind, only to be disrupted by the harsh reality of my surroundings.  My hand, once poised to create, struck the toilet handle with a jarring motion, twice in quick succession.  The stubborn, brown mass remained stuck, refusing to budge.\n\nGripping the mop loosely in my hand, I stood with my feet shoulder-width apart, my green tie feeling constrictive around my neck.  A look of mild annoyance crossed my face as I gazed at the unwelcome presence in the toilet bowl.  After a few more flushes, and a few moments of introspection, I turned to the wall to my right, grasped the toilet paper, and began to wrap my hand with it, creating a makeshift mitt.  Standing up straight, I leaned forward, and then bent at the waist, carefully dipping my hand into the bowl, as if I were handling a delicate, fragile object.",
            "The alarming rate of teenage fatalities behind the wheel has garnered significant attention in recent years.  A multifaceted analysis of this issue reveals that various factors contribute to this disturbing trend.  According to the National Institutes of Health, one crucial aspect is the biological immaturity of the adolescent brain, making it less equipped to handle the complexities of driving.  Furthermore, the lack of driving experience is a significant contributing factor, resulting not only in a higher number of fatal accidents but also increased rates of vehicle rollover, speeding, and off-road incidents. \n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center discovered a correlation between passenger age and traffic accidents.  It is not uncommon for teenagers to drive with their peers, a phenomenon that exacerbates the problem.  To mitigate this issue, some states have implemented temporary provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers.  However, these measures, in this writer's opinion, serve as a temporary solution rather than a long-term fix.\n\nA leading researcher, Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that 18 is still an inauspicious age for a full driver's license.  His research indicates that individuals under 19-20 are more inclined to engage in risk-taking behaviors due to the thrill-seeking aspect.  Postponing driving licenses until this propensity for risk-taking subsides seems prudent.  If we continue to issue licenses to young teenagers, the likelihood of fatal accidents will persist, and the death toll may escalate.  By 2010, a substantial number of new drivers will be hitting the road, exacerbating the problem.\n\nLegislative action to address this issue would be straightforward.  Driver education classes in schools could serve as a foundation for future drivers, while a universal age restriction of 18 for full driver's licenses would be implemented.  A provisional permit system could still be used as a stepping stone to a full license, accompanied by a set number of required driver training hours.  This number could be based on the existing standards set by most states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.  National legislation would provide a uniform approach to mitigating this issue across the country.  The proposed legislation is not an innovative concept but rather a sensible solution to a pressing problem.",
            "During an examination of the Edison film collection at the Library of Congress, I opted to screen all trick films from 1895 to 1901, a total of fifteen films that capitalized on creative editing techniques. My primary focus was on analyzing the poetic aspects of most trick films and identifying unique developments in a few later examples. Trick films from the turn of the century typically feature static camera placement within a proscenium frame, rely on long and medium shots, and adhere to a one-shot-per-film approach. However, some early twentieth-century films experimented with these conventions by incorporating multiple shots.\n\nA common trait among trick films is their setting within an interior space framed by a proscenium. The camera remains stationary, capturing scenes from a fixed position. This composition draws from the influence of theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic shows. One constraint of this approach is that actors generally move horizontally, rather than approaching or receding from the camera. The film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900) exemplifies this limitation, as actors enter from the right and move along the horizontal axis, remaining within the frame while the camera stays fixed.\n\nThe use of a proscenium style leads to a predominance of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups are absent in the Edison trick films, a convention borrowed from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience witnessed the entire performance, framed by the stage boundaries. Actors typically remain in the middle ground, precluding close-ups. Most early trick films follow a pattern of one conceptual shot per film, which constrains their length to approximately a minute or less, depending on the frame rate. This approach also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of trick films, which often focus on short, vaudeville-style illusions, such as magic, disappearance, and rapid scene changes with minimal storytelling. However, a closer look at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895) reveals that a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple physical shots, used to create the illusion of an apparition or disappearance.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the Republican ideology, driven by his passion for agricultural pursuits and limited foray into politics. His dual roles not only shaped his unwavering dedication to individual liberty and limited government but also influenced his views on governance. His agrarian values formed the foundation of his opinions on sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judicial system, as he sought to preserve and promote what he believed to be the superior vocation.\n\nTaylor argued that the United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of governance, unencumbered by the constraints of a native tradition. This allowed the founding fathers to create a self-governing system that embodied the natural rights of humanity. He contended that these inherent rights are interconnected, with the denial of one right diminishing the value of the remaining ones. Consequently, he believed that these rights should be beyond the reach of government interference. He posited that the concept of the \"state of nature\" implied that those with physical prowess and cunning often prospered, but that in a civilized society, this should not be the case.\n\nTo create this ideal society, Taylor believed that a government must be established, acknowledging the inherent duality of human nature. He subscribed to a rigid moral framework, distinguishing between good and evil principles. According to Taylor, good principles entailed protecting private property, promoting agriculture, and discouraging unchecked capitalism. He posited that a government founded on these principles would function equitably, regardless of its administration, which he believed would inevitably be influenced by avarice and self-interest. He saw self-interest as a fundamental driver of human behavior, but also as a force that becomes problematic when it prioritizes the interests of a select few over the public good. A well-designed government was necessary to contain human nature's darker aspects and ensure that the principles guiding it remained virtuous.\n\nTaylor, like many of his contemporaries, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution. He envisioned a federal government with strictly defined powers and responsibilities, limited to those explicitly stated in the Constitution. He recognized that an expansive federal government would be expensive and potentially tyrannical. However, he cautioned that a literal interpretation of the Constitution, without consideration for the intent behind its creation, could lead to corruption. Furthermore, Taylor considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States, as it explicitly described the country as a collection of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon examining Figure 17, a notable decline in commuter log submissions became apparent during the third month of the project, which prompted some introspection about potential causes. It is possible that the onset of winter on a New England campus contributed to a decrease in bicycle and pedestrian commutes, which may have accounted for part of the drop. Additionally, December marks the end of the fall semester, a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with final exams, grading, and other academic responsibilities, which could have led to a lapse in commuter log submissions. Furthermore, the holiday season in December often results in a prolonged break for students and faculty, during which time campus attendance is significantly reduced. The subsequent resumption of classes in late January may have also played a role in the low log submissions for that month. However, the persisting low number of submissions in February remains unexplained.\n\nOne possible explanation is that innovative projects of this nature often experience an initial surge in enthusiasm and participation, followed by a natural decline. In an effort to counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign designed to reinvigorate the initiative, which ultimately led to an increase in log submissions for that month. This highlights the challenges of sustaining project momentum in the face of seasonal fluctuations and holiday breaks common in higher education.\n\nAnother challenge inherent in projects promoting alternative modes of transportation is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving personal vehicles. To mitigate this, it is essential to offer incentives that appeal to individuals. We provided gift certificates to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and bookstores, in an effort to encourage participation. It is intriguing to consider whether larger and more significant prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric vehicles, might have had an even greater impact on participation. Modifying the prize structure over the course of the project, perhaps by announcing increased rewards in December and January, may have helped to maintain momentum and prevent the decline in engagement experienced.",
            "One of the most popular investment vehicles in today's financial landscape is the exchange-traded fund (ETF), a security that mirrors the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a portfolio of assets, similar to an index fund. However, ETFs offer a level of flexibility that sets them apart from their mutual fund counterparts, allowing investors to buy, sell, and short-sell with ease, much like individual stocks. This flexibility, coupled with the diversification benefits of an index fund, has made ETFs an attractive option for many investors. A key consideration, though, is the expense ratio, which is generally lower than that of the average mutual fund.\n\nWhile ETFs offer numerous benefits, they also come with some drawbacks, including trading commissions that are comparable to those associated with individual stocks. Furthermore, with a vast array of ETF options available, investors must carefully evaluate the benefits of each fund, including the extent to which diversification is achieved. In this analysis, we will take a closer look at the ETF IHF and compare its top 10 holdings to determine whether investing in a single ETF offers comparable benefits to a diversified portfolio of the same stocks.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we have opted to focus on the top 10 holdings, which account for approximately 63.58% of the ETF's assets. The following table presents the top 10 holdings, along with their corresponding percentages of total assets.\n\nTo gauge the representativeness of these top 10 holdings, we will use their respective asset percentages to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming a portfolio consisting solely of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF. The calculations and resulting chart are provided below.\n\nThe data indicates that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings would yield a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Moreover, the Beta of this subset of holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These preliminary findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return with a lower Beta. However, it is essential to conduct further analysis to determine whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo this end, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalized to 100%, and compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"Dream-Land\" showcases the author's notable literary achievements, with the use of the term \"Thulé\" in lines 6 and 56, which, as Thomas Ollive Mabbott notes, is a nod to the Roman poet Virgil. In his epic works, such as the Aeneid, Virgil employed the term to describe the island of Thule, situated beyond the northernmost reaches of Britain and the known world from a Greek perspective. While it is certain that Virgil indeed utilized this term, it is also crucial to acknowledge a more contemporary source that may have influenced Poe's choice of words.\n\nThe intersection of Poe's work with that of German authors is particularly noteworthy. His familiarity with the writings of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is evident in his oeuvre. As Karl J. Arndt observes in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" the similarities between their works suggest a possible imitation of Goethe's style by Poe.\n\nThe celebrated author Goethe is perhaps best known for his poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of his death. Within the latter part of this work lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thule.\" This poem revolves around a king who receives a goblet from his deceased wife and subsequently becomes consumed by grief and drinking. The king's demise serves as a poignant commentary on the human condition, as he ultimately decides to relinquish his earthly possessions to his children, except for the goblet, and takes his own life by walking to a cliff, throwing the goblet into the ocean, and closing his eyes.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thule and the character in Poe's \"Dream-Land\" are striking, with both figures grappling with loss and, in the case of the king, succumbing to excessive drinking. Furthermore, the composition of \"Faust\" into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842 is a significant event that may have influenced Poe's use of the term Thule in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" which he published shortly thereafter.\n\nPoe references Thule in multiple works, including \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" where he employs the phrase \"ultima Thule,\" and \"Dream-Land,\" where he utilizes the term as a refrain, framing the poem. This dual use of Thule may be seen as a deliberate nod to Goethe's \"The King of Thule,\" which shares thematic elements with \"Dream-Land.\" In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate and melancholic landscape, haunted by the presence of deceased friends and devoid of color, echoing the king's emotions in \"The King of Thule\" as he struggles to cope with the loss of his wife and his will to rule.\n\nPoe's acquaintance with Goethe's work is likely due to his admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, a poet he highly regarded. Poe's comments on Tennyson illustrate his esteem for the English poet, and it is reasonable to assume that he would have been familiar with Goethe's work through various reproductions and translations that were widely available following the original publication of \"Faust.\"",
            "While a plaintiff who suffered a personal injury resulting from slipping on a spill in a grocery store might be eligible to receive punitive damages under California law, the likelihood of this outcome hinges on the store manager's actions. Specifically, if the manager demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the potential consequences of their inaction following notification of the spill, the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages may be viable.\n\nA review of the case suggests that a judge is unlikely to dismiss the plaintiff's punitive damage claim outright. In California, a plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages if they can provide evidence of the defendant's actions being driven by a willful and conscious disregard for the potential harm that might result from their conduct. Furthermore, the behavior in question must be deemed \"despicable\" by the court.\n\nIn this instance, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, may argue that the store manager should have been aware of the potential risks associated with failing to clean the spill, given that multiple customers had already experienced similar incidents in the preceding months. Moreover, the fact that the manager continued to fail to take action despite this knowledge may be seen as a conscious disregard for the safety of his customers.\n\nThe plaintiff's argument regarding the manager's actions being \"despicable\" is not entirely convincing, but is still a valid point given the store's history of slip-and-fall incidents in 2009. Prior to Palmer's accident, six such incidents had occurred, yet the manager failed to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, an employee, Rich Wayne, notified the manager, Paul Martin, of the spill in an aisle. Martin replied that he was on a break and unable to address the issue. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, to which he responded in a similar manner. At 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. In the months prior to Palmer's accident, five slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store.\n\nUnder California law, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant's actions were driven by \"oppression, fraud or malice.\" The statute defines malice as conduct intended to harm, or, in the absence of such intent, behavior that is \"despicable\" and committed with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\n\nIn a relevant case, the court characterized conduct as malicious when the defendant was aware of the potential dangerous consequences of their actions and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences. This standard may be applied in the case at hand, where the manager's failure to address the spill despite prior knowledge of similar incidents may be seen as a willful and conscious disregard for the safety of his customers.",
            "It's been nearly four years since I had the opportunity to delve into the subject of Islam in a course at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  Throughout the duration of the class, one of the topics of heated discussion centered around the question of whether Islam can be perceived as a religion with a combative undertone.  In reflecting on the events that have transpired since the events of 9/11, I've observed a notable shift in the way mass media portrays Islam and its adherents.  The possibility of a presidential candidate with an Islamic background, such as Barack Obama, would have been unimaginable in 2001.\n\nI find the biography of the Prophet Muhammad to be a thought-provoking subject.  Based on my understanding of historical accounts, the biography of Muhammad appears to contradict the persona that has been traditionally associated with him.  Prior to my studies, I held the notion that Muhammad coerced conversions to Islam.  However, the biography portrays him as a figure who faced persecution and was willing to show humility in the face of adversity.  Instead of relying on force or coercion, people were drawn to his teachings through a more organic process.\n\nThere are also intriguing parallels between the lives and purported miracles of Jesus and Muhammad.  One notable example is the story of the miraculous provision of food for a group of men.  The narrative style employed in the biography of Muhammad has led me to believe that the author's intention was to present him as a humble figure who didn't require external validation, but rather allowed his actions to speak for themselves.  This approach, however, raises concerns that it diminishes the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nAdditionally, certain aspects of the biography seem to be designed to provide evidence of the authenticity of Muhammad's message.  The use of third-person narratives, where events are recounted through a chain of intermediaries, raises questions about the reliability of the accounts.  While the intention behind this approach may be to provide corroboration, I find it to be a drawback as it undermines the credibility of the stories.\n\nWhat bothers me most about this work is the way it seeks to portray Muhammad as a paragon of virtue and wisdom.  However, historical records suggest that this image may not be entirely accurate.  It's difficult not to wonder whether modern Muslims are aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A critical examination of the trajectory of Christian thought reveals a divergence from the original teachings of Jesus.  When viewed through the lens of historical evolution, it is observable that the Christian faith has gradually drifted away from its foundational principles.  The modern world exhibits an increasing awareness and a progressive inclination, which may signal a significant shift in the years to come.  While traditional adherents remain entrenched in their beliefs, their influence may not be sufficient to shape the broader narrative.  As historical awareness grows among Christians, there will be a growing desire to differentiate between the core teachings of Jesus and the supplementary doctrines that have accumulated over time.  This process may take several decades or even centuries, but its inevitability is evident.  Ultimately, a reversal of the trend in Christian history will occur, resulting in a return to the faith's original form.  A movement will emerge, gradually stripping away the layers of doctrine that have been added, much like reversing the hands of a clock.  As the movement spreads across the United States and Europe, it will inspire a renewed focus on the original message of Jesus, leading to a more uniform understanding of the faith.  Meanwhile, the institutional church will likely maintain its influence, guiding the way forward.  However, this reversal will also lead to a reduction in diversity within Christendom, as regional and denominational differences give way to greater similarities.  History is replete with examples of such reversals, including the transformation of the Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, into a bastion of Christianity, and the progression from African-American slavery to leadership in the United States.  The forthcoming reversion in the Christian faith will be a journey of rediscovery, aimed at uncovering the source of the faith and, in the process, reducing diversity.  A crucial aspect of this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus' teachings as metaphors rather than literal statements.  Tracing the evolution of the Christian faith reveals that its roots lie in Judaism, the foundational faith that existed prior to the Roman Empire's takeover of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  By that time, Jewish thought had already developed monotheism, a divinely revealed religion, and a reliance on Hebrew scripture.  However, the Jewish population was not a monolithic entity; it was comprised of distinct groups, including the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, and Zealots, each with their own perspectives and practices.",
            "Upton Sinclair's The Jungle presents a scathing critique of the innate characteristics of humanity, revealing a pervasive self-interest and lack of empathy for others. The novel masterfully illustrates this notion through the portrayal of the factory owners and managers, who prioritize their profit-driven ambitions above all else. Their relentless pursuit of wealth and growth is exemplified by the imposing factory structures, which stand as a stark reminder of the devastating impact of industrialization on the environment. Sinclair vividly describes the consequences of unchecked industrialization, likening the smoke and pollution to a \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery serves as a poignant commentary on the disregard for the well-being of those affected by their actions.\n\nThe exploitation of employees is another significant theme in the novel. Factory owners and managers demonstrate a callous disregard for the welfare of their workers, treating them as nothing more than means to an end. They engage in ruthless cost-cutting measures, pushing employees to work long hours without adequate compensation or protection. In an era with limited labor regulations, these practices were all too common, leading to the tragic fate of those who toiled in Packingtown's factories and lived amidst its toxic environment. Despite the absence of support systems for workers, some unions emerged, yet they often exploited the very people they claimed to represent, exacerbating the problem. Sinclair's portrayal of the workers as \"slaves\" is a powerful indictment of the dehumanizing effects of the industrial system, which perpetuated poverty, immorality, and despair.\n\nThe novel presents a grim picture of a society in which the pursuit of wealth and power trumps all other considerations, leaving the most vulnerable members of society to suffer the consequences. Through its vivid descriptions and compelling narrative, The Jungle highlights the urgent need for a more compassionate and equitable society.",
            "The manipulation of reader emotion and perception is a crucial element in literary works, and many authors employ various techniques to achieve this. F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, The Great Gatsby, exemplifies this practice through a range of strategies. One notable technique involves the deliberate pairing of seemingly incongruous adjectives with nouns to evoke a particular atmosphere. Additionally, Fitzgerald frequently assigns symbolic meanings to various colors, which he then leverages to convey specific connotations.\n\nFitzgerald's utilization of color symbolism is particularly evident in the novel, as he builds and exploits the associations of white and gray to convey distinct ideas. Initially, he establishes a connection between these colors and the themes of uniformity and social class. The repetitive use of white and gray throughout the novel serves to reinforce this connection, with the former often signifying a sense of refinement and the latter, a sense of age and decay. \n\nFor instance, the characters of Daisy and Jordan are frequently depicted wearing white, which reinforces the notion of their privileged status. Similarly, the descriptions of Nick's journey through the city, where he encounters \"white chasms\" and \"gray names\" on a timetable, solidify the connection between these colors and the themes of social hierarchy. Moreover, Fitzgerald extends this symbolism to everyday objects and people, describing them as white or gray to emphasize their mundane and unremarkable nature. \n\nHowever, Fitzgerald also employs a reversal of this symbolism to convey the idea that certain characters or objects have become mere caricatures, stripped of their individuality. The reappearance of Daisy in white attire, for instance, serves to underscore her status as a chimera, a symbol of the unattainable and ultimately empty ideal that Gatsby longs for. Furthermore, the repeated use of gray and white to describe Daisy's appearance and surroundings serves to reinforce this notion, suggesting that she has become a uniform, two-dimensional figure in Gatsby's eyes.",
            "The San Diego area boasts an exceptionally fertile agricultural landscape, primarily due to its temperate and sunny climate. A diverse array of crops can be found in this region, including a variety of fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, and broccoli, as well as an assortment of herbs, tree fruits, berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for organic community-supported agriculture is substantial in San Diego, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic dairy products like eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, providing visitors with the opportunity to engage in activities like hiking and birdwatching, further enhancing the land's recreational value.\n\nMoreover, organic farming practices can have a positive impact on the local ecosystem by promoting biodiversity and reducing the use of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming often comes with higher costs compared to conventional methods. Organic farming requires more labor-intensive strategies to control pests and weeds and maintain soil fertility without the use of chemicals, which can result in greater losses and lower efficiency compared to large-scale conventional operations. Furthermore, smaller organic farms may struggle to replicate the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations. To mitigate these challenges, landowners may need to invest in additional labor and expertise to implement beneficial practices such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and managing plant growth to create specific habitats.\n\nThe proposed site, situated adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California, comprises 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, bordering the Cleveland National Forest. This land is located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which aims to protect over 100 species of plants and animals, many of which are endangered or at risk of being listed, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher.\n\nThe region has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for untold generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of an original homestead patent, likely used for grazing and/or wood production over the years.\n\nTo research potential options for mitigating costs and maintaining wildlife-friendly operations on this land, I identified a local organic farm in the same area and examined government programs that may be available to small farmers. This case study aims to illustrate the feasibility of establishing an organic farm on this site while preserving the natural habitat and biodiversity.",
            "The nuances of a culture play a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of negotiation. Culture can be multifaceted, comprised of both what it is and what it represents. It is not a uniform entity, nor is it defined by its homogeneity. Making sweeping statements, such as attributing certain traits to an entire nation or community, is an oversimplification. While understanding the generalizations within a culture can be beneficial, a more productive approach involves grasping the significance of that culture to the specific context and how it might influence the negotiation process. When interacting with a foreign culture, it's natural for individuals to draw comparisons to their own, which can facilitate a deeper understanding.\n\nTo effectively engage with a foreign culture or mindset, one may need to delve into its history, customs, and perhaps even its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's essential to accept and work within its parameters, particularly in the context of negotiation, especially when dealing with a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for traditions and values in a foreign environment can also aid in bridging cultural divides and advancing the negotiation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that culture transcends national or international boundaries, and companies within a nation often develop their unique corporate cultures. For instance, some organizations prioritize long working hours, while others adopt a more relaxed schedule. This can be reflected in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within the United States, there exists considerable diversity in corporate culture between companies and even within the same company across different regions and urban or suburban environments. This diversity highlights the importance of looking beyond surface-level differences.\n\nUnderstanding the underlying values of a culture is also crucial, as they provide insight into the motivations and priorities that drive its behavior. For example, a culture that places great importance on saving face or maintaining harmony may be less likely to publicly confront or shame its superiors. Conversely, a culture that values a hard-driven bargain may be more inclined to negotiate aggressively. By considering these general trends and taking the time to learn about the individual involved, a negotiator can tailor their approach to achieve a more effective outcome.",
            "The notion that a higher power does not exist is often posited by those who doubt the divine.  This concept is first introduced in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and serves as a foundation for the philosophical arguments of St. Anselm and Thomas Aquinas. A comparative analysis of their ideas will require us to assume they are both attempting to prove the existence of a singular deity, as comparing their arguments to a more abstract concept of a god would be less meaningful.  We will therefore proceed under the assumption that they both believe in the same God as described in the Bible. In exploring their arguments, we aim to identify which one presents a more compelling case for the existence of a higher power.\n\nTo begin, we will examine the core of St. Anselm's argument. His ideas revolve around the concept of introspection, suggesting that the existence of God can be understood by looking inward. Anselm posits that because God exists within our cognitive framework, we cannot fully comprehend a world without Him. While this concept is sometimes convoluted and difficult to follow, the basic premise is that truth about God can be discerned through individual introspection. He implies that one need not rely on external evidence to confirm the existence of God, but rather that the truth is inherent within the self. This idea is often associated with faith, which is characterized by a reliance on internal conviction rather than empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a more empirically grounded approach. He argues that the existence of God can be proven through reason and observation, entirely independent of faith. This perspective would be advantageous for evangelism, as it would enable the recruitment of new followers without relying on their willingness to accept a concept that cannot be proven. By presenting a logical case, Aquinas believes that the existence of God can be demonstrated through five distinct arguments: the necessity for a first cause, the origin of causality, the existence of contingent beings, the degrees of perfection, and the concept of order. Each of these arguments is designed to illustrate the logical necessity of God's existence. For instance, if a puzzle is incomplete, we can deduce the existence and characteristics of the missing piece based on the relationships between the other pieces without actually seeing it.",
            "In the distant past, a pivotal figure known as the Buddha emerged, destined to shape the course of history. As his life unfolded, he chose to renounce worldly pursuits and embarked on a transformative journey, culminating in enlightenment. The teachings of this enigmatic figure eventually gave rise to a profound spiritual tradition known as Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism standing as one of its most enduring manifestations. Over the centuries, this ancient faith has undergone significant evolution, manifesting in diverse expressions that diverge from its earliest forms. A striking example of this can be observed in the island nation of Sri Lanka, where the Theravada Buddhist community annually observes the water-cutting ceremony. This event, while seemingly incongruous with the Buddha's teachings, holds deep spiritual significance for both monastic and lay practitioners. This dichotomy highlights the dynamic interplay between tradition and adaptation, as the Theravada community has had to navigate the complex interplay of internal and external influences.\n\nThroughout this discussion, key terms will be employed to facilitate a nuanced exploration of the subject. To clarify, internal forces refer to stimuli originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic affiliation. Conversely, external forces emanate from non-Buddhist sources. Hostile forces are characterized by a negative impact on the Buddhist community, often resulting from a distorted perception of the faith. By contrast, benign forces neither intend to harm nor help the community, although their effects may be unintended.\n\nTo establish a solid foundation for further analysis, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. Adherents seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts comprising three primary baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, delving into metaphysical concepts. Central to these teachings are the notions of Anatta (no self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Recognizing these principles is crucial to transcending Sansara, the cycle of birth and death, and ultimately liberating oneself from the bondage of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka provides a framework for monastic and lay practitioners alike, outlining rules for living a virtuous life. For laymen, the five precepts serve as a moral compass, while for monks, a more comprehensive set of discipline is observed. At the core of Buddhist doctrine lies the four noble truths: Dukkha (suffering as an inherent aspect of life), the causes of suffering (attachment), and the possibility of overcoming it.",
            "From 1836 to 1893, a protracted period of animosity existed between the United States and Mexico, spanning nearly six decades.  This prolonged rivalry peaked during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the U.S. ultimately prevailed, annexing Texas and the southwestern territories (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145).  A series of confrontations, including border skirmishes and disputes over territory, punctuated the relationship between the two nations, which began to subside just before the onset of World War I.  Initially, the rivalry was fueled by fundamental disagreements over issues such as faith, cultural identity, and tradition, as well as the clash of material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). \n\nThe dynamics at play in this bilateral rivalry bear resemblance to those found in other neighboring nations.  Shared borders often give rise to conflicting interests, which in turn contribute to the development of rival positions between the nations involved.  The U.S.-Mexico relationship is but one example of a long-standing rivalry between nations that share a common border.  In fact, according to Pletcher (1977), Mexico and Cuba are the only nations in the Americas to have consistently presented diplomatic challenges for the United States (p. 41).  Notably, both Mexico and Cuba are geographically proximate to the U.S. and have historically been rivals, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed positive relations with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also contributed to the tension between the two nations, a phenomenon that has occurred throughout history.  Frahm (2001) notes that, while the U.S. has historically opposed ideologies like fascism and communism, it was previously opposed to Catholicism and monarchical systems (p. 86).  Similar to the ideological underpinnings of the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the conflict between the U.S. and Mexico was rooted in a combination of ideological differences and competition over vital interests.  However, in this case, the ideological disparities were primarily driven by religious preferences, rather than differing political systems.  These underlying tensions were inherited from the historic rivalry between England and Spain, and continued to impede the establishment of amicable relations between the two nations.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) identified 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during the 57-year period of animosity (p. 145).  A significant proportion of these disputes involved territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into the U.S. and other frontier problems.  The problem of banditry and lawlessness along the U.S.-Mexico border persisted until both nations deployed military force to secure their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97). \n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry between the two nations began to ease as Mexico became increasingly dependent on the U.S. (p. 109), and ultimately subsided as the U.S.'s goals shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the latter half of the 19th century.",
            "It's been nearly two decades since my life took an unforeseen turn. At the time, I was a dedicated nurse, driven by a lifelong quest for stability and security. As I navigated adolescence, a recurring message echoed in my mind: \"You'll always find employment.\" This mantra, though well-intentioned, steered me away from my true aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist. Thus, I pursued a career in nursing, a field that offered a sense of predictability.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans. I found myself at 46, single, and financially strained, with a disabling condition that rendered me unable to work. Fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability benefits have left me with little to call my own. Each day is a struggle, testing my resilience and self-worth. It's a battle that I wouldn't have survived without the unwavering support of my loved ones and a handful of trusted friends. Their aid has been a beacon of hope in dark times, reminding me that even in the face of adversity, I'm not alone.\n\nThe experience has taught me a valuable lesson: life's unpredictability is undeniable. No matter how prepared we think we are, some challenges are too great to overcome solo. I firmly believe that we, as a nation, must acknowledge this reality and work towards a more cohesive, supportive community.\n\nWhile it's essential to be self-sufficient, I disagree with the notion that we should solely rely on individual efforts. America's resilience in the past wasn't built on isolationism, but rather on collective compassion, mutual respect, and resource sharing. The pioneers who braved the treacherous trails to the West Coast didn't achieve their goals alone; they relied on the help of their communities.\n\nPreparing for the unexpected is crucial. I've taken steps to ensure my preparedness, equipping myself with a disaster kit, first aid supplies, and a small cache of essential items. If possible, cultivating a self-sufficient lifestyle through gardening or preserving food can be a valuable asset. However, it's equally important to foster meaningful relationships with those around you, particularly your neighbors.\n\nBy acknowledging our vulnerabilities and embracing a spirit of mutual support, we can create a stronger, more resilient society.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a subject of ongoing inquiry. While D'Arcy Thompson's assertion in 1917 that the definition of organic forms in mathematical language is a distant goal still holds true today, recent advancements in mathematical modeling have led to the application of theoretical frameworks to mollusk skeletogenesis. A study currently underway is exploring the potential of mathematical modeling in combination with experimental research to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. This investigation employs X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative characteristics that can be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters are then fed into the computational program CerioShell, developed by Stone in 1995. Hypothetical shell morphologies are generated to inform the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum, which are subsequently integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to deepen our understanding of macroevolutionary events within this clade.\n\nA shell can be visualized as a toroidal structure that traverses a 360-degree arc through space over time. The whorls, or spiral turns of the shell, are considered to revolve around an imaginary axis, referred to as the columella, which passes through the central column of the shell. The rate at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated by a continuous line, or suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire, and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal emerges from its shell through the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The standard orientation is apertural, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves first observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn to divide the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this reference point, with estimates rounded to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be regarded as a series of openings that traverse space and time as the animal constructs its shell. By tracking the path of the aperture using coordinates of the center of each whorl's opening and the horizontal and vertical radius, it is possible to chart the shell's trajectory. This trajectory can be mathematically formulated and represented graphically. Once a mathematical model is established, parameters can be manipulated to alter the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "A stagnant neonatal and infant mortality rate has persisted in Indonesia for the past decade, despite progress in other Millennium Development Goals, such as water and sanitation targets. While the country has made strides in certain areas, including a notable increase in births attended by skilled health workers – now accounting for 72% – the related improvements are mitigated by the fact that traditional workers, like midwives, cannot provide medical interventions in complicated cases, resulting in a significant number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. The data also reveals a concerning trend of declining treatment rates for diarrheal cases in children under five by health professionals, as well as incomplete postnatal care data, suggesting a pressing need for improvement. Cesarean section rates are unacceptably low, at around 4%, and exacerbate a broader issue: unequal access to healthcare across the country, with a stark urban-rural divide. The healthcare access gap between the poorest and richest quintiles stands at 27%, underscoring the difficulties faced by the disadvantaged in accessing essential services, largely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nWhen considering solutions, the primary challenge lies in effectively addressing the shortage of healthcare services. Essentially, the question is whether Indonesia should focus on strengthening its overall health system, or adopt a more targeted approach by developing program-specific interventions. While the latter, known as vertical approaches, can yield faster results by targeting specific sectors and objectives, it also carries drawbacks. Significant investments in one area of the health sector can divert resources away from other crucial areas and lead to a brain drain towards the more resourced sectors. Furthermore, multiple parallel programs can result in duplication of services, uncoordinated efforts, and an excessive administrative burden.",
            "The distinctive hallmark of Victorian literature lies in its meticulous attention to minute details and a preoccupation with the nobility of the era.  However, two notable exceptions to this trend are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, which deviate from the norm by incorporating elements of enigma and a flair for the unconventional, unusual in the literature of the time.  This unusual approach lends depth to the characters, providing profound insight into their motivations and emotions.\n\nAs Oliver Twist navigates the labyrinthine world of Fagin's underworld, he becomes increasingly beset by a maelstrom of disorienting thoughts and visions.  His mind is assaulted by the cacophony of Sikes and Crackit's contentious argument, and he finds himself trapped in a surreal realm where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur.  The staccato bursts of gunfire and the eerie cries of the crowd serve to further disorient him, as an unseen force propels him through a nightmarish landscape of pain and despair.\n\nIn Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, the authors employ dream sequences and dreamlike states to heighten the sense of mystery and unease.  In the case of Oliver Twist, these episodes often serve as a window into the protagonist's inner world, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities that surround him.  The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28 is a prime example of this, as Oliver relives the traumatic event in vivid detail, his senses numbed by the sheer horror of it all.  The passage conveys Oliver's overwhelming sense of powerlessness in the face of his circumstances, as he is borne away by an unseen force, his emotions mired in a quagmire of fear and pain.\n\nThe shooting sequence serves to underscore the notion that Oliver is a pawn in a larger game, with forces beyond his control dictating the course of his life.  As he struggles to find solace in the face of his dire circumstances, Oliver's growing sense of defeat is palpable, as if he has been irreparably broken by the cruel hand of fate.  The passage implies that Oliver's inability to exert control over his own life is a hallmark of his character, a testament to the crushing power of his circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile, in Wuthering Heights, the author employs a similar technique to create a sense of disorientation and unease.  The passage from the novel reads: \"The day passed off – day!  There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A pivotal experience I had several years ago has had a lasting impact on my perspective on the challenges faced by students in elementary education. I was involved with an after-school program that provided academic support to students of varying skill levels, with a particular focus on those struggling in specific subjects. As an individual with strengths in English and reading, I was approached by one of the instructors to assist a young boy named Adrian, who was struggling with reading difficulties. Initially, I noticed that his reading issues were particularly puzzling, as he demonstrated a good understanding of certain letter pronunciation while struggling with others. This peculiar phenomenon was further complicated by the fact that Adrian's mother, who accompanied him to the program, communicated primarily in Spanish.\n\nDuring a moment of clarity, it became apparent that Adrian's difficulties stemmed from his lack of familiarity with the English alphabet, rather than any deficiency in reading comprehension. This realization sparked a sense of urgency to find a suitable solution. Although I am uncertain whether this epiphany had a lasting impact on Adrian's academic trajectory, I hope that he has made significant progress since then.\n\nThis anecdote serves as a poignant reminder of the language barrier that exists in educational settings, particularly in multicultural environments like California. It highlights the need for creative solutions to address this issue. While some may assume that students who speak English fluently are not affected by reading challenges, this is far from the truth. In fact, even for those who possess native-like proficiency in the language, reading can still pose a significant obstacle.\n\nIn the case of Adrian, a tailored approach involving targeted English reading instruction, specifically focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved to be an effective solution. However, for students who are non-native English speakers, the solution is far more complex. A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be successful, as each child's needs are unique. A combination of strategies, including bilingual education, mainstream immersion, private tutors, ESL classes, and others, is essential.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, holds great promise. Research has shown that children participating in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and the potential lack of benefits for majority-language students, these fears are unfounded. Implementing dual language programs as a standard practice, rather than an exception, would yield benefits for all students. The question remains, however, how to implement this in a practical manner. Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is unrealistic, but providing bilingual support staff, such as tutors or aides, is a viable solution. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and effective learning environment that meets the diverse needs of all students.",
            "The notion that there exists something beyond our mortal grasp has been a recurring theme throughout human history.  From early childhood, we are exposed to various belief systems that aim to fill the void left by our limited understanding.  For some, this involves formal instruction in places of worship, while others may seek answers within or adopt the faith of their forebears.  However, not everyone conforms to these preconceived notions, often rejecting them in favor of a more individualized worldview.  This existential search for meaning is a deeply personal journey, as individuals strive to define themselves through their unique perspectives on spirituality.  It is in these moments of introspection that we seek illumination, yearning to transcend the darkness and find solace in the light.\n\nMy father's gaze drifted aimlessly into the rain-soaked evening, a mixture of contemplation and reminiscence etched on his face.  We sat together on the worn porch, the rhythmic beat of the raindrops on the tin roof creating a melancholic melody.  His usually robust frame had thinned, and his hair had begun to recede, accentuating the gaunt lines of his face.  As we silently shared a cigarette, I felt an unspoken sense of unease, as if acknowledging the impending loss would only make it more poignant.  I reached out, embracing him in a gesture of affection, and we both became lost in the somber beauty of the June twilight.\n\nTragically, we lost him in December, just five days shy of my twenty-second birthday.  The treatments had prolonged his life, but at what cost?  I couldn't help but wonder whether such suffering had any redeeming value.  As the darkness closed in, I found myself questioning the existence of a higher power, wondering if it had abandoned me.  In the still of the night, I chose not to seek solace in prayer, instead leaving my thoughts unspoken.  If a deity existed, I reasoned, it had long since tuned out my pleas.\n\nI opted not to witness his final moments, unable to bear the thought of watching the man who had given me life slip away.  I wanted to remember him in the vibrant, living person he was, not in his final, fading breaths.  Besides, I knew him better than anyone, and I was confident that he would have wanted me to cherish the memories of our time together, rather than being by his side as he left this world.  For three days, I retreated into a cocoon of grief, waiting for the news that would change my life forever.  The silence was deafening, a stark reminder that, even in my darkest hour, I was left to confront my sorrow alone.",
            "The term \"Gothic Novel\" is often seen as an oxymoronic blend of the old and the new, as 18th-century literary critic Ian Watt noted in his work on the genre. Throughout the centuries, the Gothic mode has been subject to both scathing critique and fervent praise, with some viewing it as lacking depth and others seeing it as a masterclass in evoking the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). At its inception, the Gothic novel drew inspiration from a fusion of ancient romance and modern literary techniques. The pioneering \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, exemplified this merging of old and new by incorporating traditional theatrical elements and naturalistic narrative styles. Walpole's work, which he termed a \"Gothic Story,\" (Walpole 4) laid the groundwork for the genre, blending medieval themes, theatrical conventions, and architectural motifs with the emerging format of the novel. The term \"gothic\" itself was initially used to describe various cultures, styles, and eras, often with negative connotations, implying a lack of sophistication. The juxtaposition of the theatrical, antiquated \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative narrative structure allowed it to endure and remain relevant across time, simultaneously appearing both outdated and fresh to readers separated from the original work.\n\nA key element of the Gothic novel is the concept of chivalry, a medieval ideal of knighthood that Walpole's work preserves and reinterprets. Chivalry, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and competence, held significant cultural significance, particularly for writers like Walpole who perceived a decline in these values in their contemporary society. Through the use of chivalric motifs and ideals, the Gothic novel idealized and romanticized the past, foreshadowing the development of the Romantic movement. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's portrayal of characters like Frederic, a prince who embodies traditional chivalric virtues, serves as a prime example of this phenomenon. Frederic's description, which highlights his nobility, suffering, and gallantry, exemplifies the exaggerated chivalric ideal, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (Walpole 66).",
            "The concept of supply chain management is a multifaceted process that encompasses the logistical movement of goods from procurement to delivery, thereby ensuring seamless service to customers. This concept was first introduced in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, who described the intricacies of supply chain operations as a holistic process geared towards efficient and timely delivery. The six core components of supply chain management serve as the foundation for providing exceptional customer service.\n\nKey elements include production, supply, inventory management, distribution, transportation, and information management. By effectively utilizing these components, businesses can establish themselves as reliable service providers.\n\nThe production phase represents the initial stage of the supply chain, laying the groundwork for subsequent processes. To initiate production, it is essential for managers to comprehend customer demands, which can be gauged through market analysis. By understanding market trends, businesses can make informed decisions regarding product offerings and production quantities. The next step involves determining the optimal production location and facilities, taking into account factors such as product quality, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.\n\nOnce the production location has been established, managers focus on workload scheduling and equipment maintenance. A well-planned production process is crucial to avoiding potential delays and costs. Companies like Wal-Mart and Target have implemented detailed processes and procedures to ensure a smooth operational workflow, minimizing confusion and maintaining high productivity.\n\nSupply is the second critical element in supply chain management, encompassing strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. Businesses may choose to divide production into multiple divisions to cater to diverse product requirements. Managers must select the most suitable division for each process, considering factors such as equipment, personnel, and specialties. Outsourcing is another option, often employed to enhance velocity – the capacity to deliver quality products while minimizing costs.",
            "The claim that a notorious historical figure is alive in a Southeast Asian nation, now known as Myanmar, is nonsensically emblazoned on a makeshift sign held aloft by Ellen Page, a prominent actress known for her role in the film Juno. The stark contrast between her solitary figure on a street corner and the ominous message on her placard, scrawled in bold marker strokes, is a jarring juxtaposition. Myanmar, a country in the region, has been subject to a repressive military regime since 1962, following a coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests swept through the nation, driven in part by Buddhist monks and earning the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution,\" a nod to the distinctive robes worn by these monks. The protests, initially peaceful, eventually escalated into violent confrontations between the monks and the military junta, with the latter resorting to brutal suppression, including the ransacking of monasteries and the imprisonment of foreign journalists. The death toll, officially reported as 13, is disputed, with Colonel Hla Win, a former military officer, estimating that the true number of fatalities is in the thousands.\n\nThis disturbing phenomenon, however, is not unique to Myanmar. Throughout history, governments have consistently sought to maintain their authority and crush dissent, often with tragic consequences. Ancient Roman leaders, for instance, claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were revered as deities. In more recent times, we see parallels in the actions of authoritarian leaders, such as the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, where peaceful protesters were met with brutal force, and the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militia groups, backed by the government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderates. The persecution of Jews during World War II, orchestrated by the Nazi regime, is another egregious example.",
            "Duke Ellington's lasting impact on jazz can be attributed to his impressive career span and demonstrated ability to shape his ensemble's artistic direction. Although his piano playing is often understated in the selected pieces, as a master composer, Ellington excelled at crafting intricate and varied musical pieces that showcased the individual talents of his band members. By establishing a framework for improvisation and incorporating precisely orchestrated passages that highlighted the unique styles of each musician, Ellington successfully brought out the distinctive tone of his orchestra. His understanding of the unique timbres and interactions of his ensemble members enabled him to create some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary notes Ellington's pioneering use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" in his career, exemplified by Creole Love Call. This innovative approach involved incorporating voice as a textural element, free from the constraints of traditional lyrics. Creole Love Call, an early piece, exemplifies Ellington's ability to enhance the style of his soloists, a trait evident throughout his career. This twelve-bar blues piece, characterized by a slow and deliberate pace, features six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response pattern is established between the vocalist and reeds, with the voice transitioning from smooth to rougher textures towards the end.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo elaborates on the melody, emphasizing extended notes and chromaticism.\nChorus 3: A clarinet solo soars in the upper register, accompanied by a subtle piano ostinato.\nChorus 4: The full ensemble echoes the first chorus, replicating the call-and-response dialogue between brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climax of the piece occurs as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high range, backed by syncopated stop-time rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: The structure of the first chorus is revisited, with the vocalist adopting a growl technique, soloing as a virtuosic instrument.\nA brief tag features a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, rounding out the piece.\n\nEllington's use of voice as a means of adding tonal depth to Creole Love Call is reflective of a hallmark of his compositional style.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington skillfully combines his expertise in orchestration with his keen sense of timbre. The song features a call-and-response exchange between Bubber Miley's muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing, effectively blurring the lines between vocal and instrumental elements. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington showcases Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents in introducing the melody on muted trombone.",
            "A nagging void had always gnawed at her, a feeling that persisted despite her best efforts to satiate it. It began to manifest when she was 14, as she navigated the complexities of adolescence. Now, at 17, this unfulfilled longing still lingered, albeit with a subtle shift in focus - from an intangible something to a specific someone. Yet, her interactions with boys had yielded no spark, and she found herself bewildered by this peculiarity. As she pondered this enigma, theories began to surface, but none proved convincing enough to allay her doubts. As a result, she continued to live a life of introspection and questioning.\n\nOrdinarily, her days at home were marked by a sense of serenity, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. Her parents' relationship was characterized by a remarkable absence of conflict, and arguments with their daughter were rare. Their disagreements typically revolved around her strong will and independent nature, which often served as a counterpoint to their tranquil energies. Her unique blend of a lively personality and kind heart made her a likable and well-liked individual.\n\nHowever, today was an exception. As she roamed the house in search of inspiration, she was startled by a faint cry from the kitchen and the unmistakable timbre of her mother's voice. Her heart racing, she sprinted towards the source of the sound and found her mother lying on the floor, her face contorted in pain. \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" she exclaimed, her voice laced with alarm. Upon closer inspection, she noticed her mother's labored breathing and urgent entreaties to get her to the hospital. The daughter sprang into action, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's shoulder and asking for directions. \"Okay, Mom, where can I take you?\" she asked, trying to keep her composure. Her mother's instructions were hasty and pained, but she managed to decipher them. The daughter quickly lifted her mother and carried her to the car, carefully placing her in the back seat before driving off.\n\nUpon arriving at the hospital, the familiar scent of disinfectant and the hum of anxious chatter enveloped her. Yet, her focus remained fixed on her mother's well-being, and she darted into action, calling out for medical assistance. A team of worried faces soon gathered, and someone hastened to bring a gurney to the stricken woman. The doctors quickly took her in for evaluation, leaving her daughter to wait anxiously.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had taken a tumble while attempting to retrieve a vase from the top shelf of a step stool.",
            "This investigation aimed to examine the relationship between adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and the risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke mortality. The alternate Mediterranean diet score, a modified version of the Mediterranean diet, evaluates the consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as monounsaturated fats, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. The diet also permits moderate alcohol intake.\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and total and cardiovascular mortality. Moreover, a controlled trial found that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and reducing the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals. However, no prior research has specifically focused on the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis prospective cohort study followed 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Between 1984 and 2004, food frequency questionnaires, which assessed nutrient intake over the preceding year, were completed six times. The questionnaires were validated through medical record reviews and were found to be reliable. Self-reported cases of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified through medical records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, probable cases were included, accounting for approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarcts.\n\nTo reduce individual variability and better reflect long-term dietary habits, cumulative averages of the alternate Mediterranean diet score were calculated by averaging scores from the preceding two years. The analysis controlled for potential confounders, including age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nUsing Cox proportional-hazard modeling, the study examined the association between the alternate Mediterranean diet score and the risk of CHD and stroke, with separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke. The results showed that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher alternate Mediterranean diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 incident CHD cases, 1763 stroke cases, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest quintile of the alternate Mediterranean diet score had a lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "The financial downturn that beset the United States in 2007 was a catastrophic event with far-reaching implications for the nation's economy. Rising unemployment, a collapsed housing market, and the devastating consequences for several leading corporations exemplified the gravity of the situation. To prevent such a catastrophe from occurring again, it is essential to examine the factors that contributed to this economic downturn and identify potential solutions to mitigate its effects. The root cause of the crisis was a series of misguided policy decisions that led to the proliferation of sub-prime lending in a fragile financial system.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, under the Clinton administration, lending regulations were relaxed to increase homeownership rates among low- and moderate-income households. As reported by Steven Holmes of the New York Times, \"Fannie Mae, the nation's largest mortgage underwriter, faced pressure from the administration to expand its lending activities and from shareholders to maintain its impressive growth in profits.\" Holmes astutely predicted the potential consequences of these actions, stating, \"The government-subsidized corporation may struggle in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.\" Unfortunately, his forecast proved accurate.\n\nThe complex web of mortgage products that emerged in the years leading up to the crisis played a significant role in exacerbating the situation. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were widely used, intertwining various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This led to a situation in which U.S. households and financial markets became increasingly vulnerable to even minor fluctuations in housing prices.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had invested in mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. The top five U.S. investment banks collectively held $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. The consequences were severe: Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at deeply discounted prices, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to undergo significant regulatory reforms. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "The perils of exposition: a writer's nemesis, a reader's barrier.  It's the moment when the author's wings spread wide, only to find themselves stuck in the quicksand of unnecessary detail, suffocating the very story they sought to tell.  Even the most seasoned wordsmiths, like Dr. Merlin, can fall prey to the temptation of Too Much Information, their frustration evident in the muttered curses at their screens.\n\nWhile we've all heard the advice to \"Show, don't tell,\" it's a mantra that's easier to preach than practice.  Exposition can be a seductive siren, luring the author into the waters of tedious description and exposition, where the story's momentum falters and the reader's attention wanes.\n\nIn essence, exposition is the act of conveying information directly to the audience, often through straightforward prose.  In film, it manifests as the \"info dump,\" a cinematic cliche exemplified by \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In literature, it's the author's equivalent, where the narrative is bogged down by unnecessary explanations.\n\nConsider a hypothetical example: a heroine meets her love interest, they get married, and he's brutally murdered in front of her.  A two-page summary of this sequence would likely leave readers uninvested, with both characters relegated to mere footnotes.  A more effective approach would be to delve into the husband's character, revealing his depth through his words and actions.  This would allow readers to connect with his fate and, by extension, the heroine's emotional response.  By fleshing out the narrative, you create a richer, more immersive experience for the reader.\n\nIn other words, a good story needs more substance than its bare bones.  A simple \"They met, they married, he died\" won't cut it.  As a writer, it's your job to add the meat to the bones, to make the narrative more relatable and engaging.  Sometimes, it's easy to get carried away with the details, but it's crucial to resist the urge to info-dump.  Consider the example of a character with a military background, now working as a gas station manager.  Rather than listing his entire backstory, you could subtly weave these details into the narrative, revealing his personality and motivations through his actions and dialogue.  By doing so, you'll create a more nuanced character and a more engaging story.",
            "This morning, I watched a pair of news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, dated August 13, 2011. The first was a live NBC 4 broadcast. The lead story focused on a violent incident in Ashley, Ohio, in which a man named Shad Hostettler allegedly stabbed his wife; her identity was not disclosed. The news team displayed his mug shot, which appeared to convey a sense of foreboding. Given the developing nature of the story, the coverage was relatively brief, lasting around two minutes. I believe the time allocated was suitable.\n\nThe second story reported on an early morning shooting that occurred in the Sharon Woods area, involving an 18-year-old man named Travis Buyers. He was shot and critically injured, but no arrests had been made at the time of the broadcast. The SWAT Team was investigating the incident. This story seemed concise, and it's possible that the brevity was due to the fact that it involved a young black man from a predominantly black neighborhood. It's worth noting that crime stories involving minority victims often receive limited media attention, whereas high-profile cases involving white victims tend to dominate the headlines.\n\nThe following story addressed a mysterious gunshot wound that damaged a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided details about the incident's location and concluded that a .22 caliber rifle bullet was responsible. Crime-Stoppers offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the shooter's apprehension.\n\nAnother story highlighted the impending severe weather, including thunderstorms forecasted for Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to remain in the mid to low 80s throughout the weekend. While the segment was brief, it served as a teaser to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAdditionally, the broadcast covered a robbery at a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned man wearing a hoodie, was reported to be approximately 6 feet tall and 150 pounds. The news team devoted an unexpected amount of airtime to highlighting the perpetrator's skin color.\n\nLastly, the broadcast featured a report on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation between Texas and Ohio. He was sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana. While it's not clear why the news team chose to specify the sentence in this manner, it's worth noting that mentioning his Hispanic heritage seemed tangential to the story.",
            "In the complex web of relationships between siblings, a unique dynamic unfolds. The bond between brothers is multifaceted, encompassing a range of emotions that often contradict one another. These contrasting feelings of love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty can be palpable, as brothers come to understand each other in a way that transcends the connections they share with others. When the stakes are high, the true nature of this bond is revealed, often in its most profound and unsettling forms. The consequences of this complex emotional landscape can be far-reaching, requiring those who navigate it to confront the costs of their actions.\n\nA poignant example of this dynamic can be seen in the novel \"The Scarlet Ibis.\" Set against the backdrop of a lush, vivid landscape, the story follows two brothers on a journey marked by both hope and heartbreak. In a climactic scene, the tension between bitter disappointment and intense pride comes to a head, resulting in a tragic outcome. Through the protagonist's character and his interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's perspective, the novel skillfully conveys the intricate emotions that shape the protagonist's world.\n\nAt its core, the protagonist's actions are driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From the outset, his relationship with his younger brother, Doodle, is marked by a sense of disillusionment and frustration. The protagonist had envisioned a different kind of brotherhood, one in which he could share his skills and experiences with someone who could keep pace with him. However, Doodle's health issues render such a partnership impossible, forcing the protagonist to confront the harsh reality of his brother's limitations. This sense of disappointment and anger eventually gives way to a more profound recognition of his brother's value, as evidenced by his conflicted thoughts about Doodle's well-being. The complexity of his emotions is particularly evident in his recollections of considering a tragic act, which ultimately reveals the depth of his love and compassion for his brother. The episode serves as a powerful reminder that even the most contradictory emotions can coexist within us, and that our true character is often revealed in the choices we make.",
            "The human brain is a complex, dynamic information-processing entity that has been the subject of various analogies and comparisons as technology has evolved. Initially, it was likened to a primitive recording surface, followed by a scroll, and more recently, to a sophisticated processing system. It is essential to recognize the limitations of these analogies, which can lead to oversimplification and inaccuracies in understanding the brain's functionality.\n\nInformation processing commences with sensory input from organs, which transmute physical stimuli such as tactile sensations, thermal fluctuations, sound waves, or light particles into electrical signals. This sensory information is repeatedly reconfigured through both ascending and descending processing pathways. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black rectangle on a white background, ascending processing assembles basic information like color, orientation, and the object's borders – where the color changes notably over a short distance – to conclude that you are perceiving a rectangle. Descending processing utilizes the decisions made at intermediate stages of the ascending process to expedite your recognition of the rectangle. Descending processing in this example might facilitate identifying the object as a black rectangle rather than a rectangular void in the white background.\n\nAs information is processed to a certain degree, a selective filter determines its significance and allocates it to pertinent cognitive processes. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance down at your shoes, a healthy selective filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy environment. There are multiple stages of processing, and the results of processing are subject to modulation by selective attention repeatedly.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first be stored. There exist various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with encoding methods specific to each type of sensory stimulus. For instance, verbal input can be encoded in terms of its visual appearance, phonetic structure, or semantic meaning. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Certain animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained by an electrical signal circulating through a particular series of neurons for a brief period. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained in the arrangement of specific types of proteins.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized within the brain, some grounded in human subjects' memory retrieval patterns, others based on computer science principles, and others rooted in neurophysiological considerations. The conceptual network model posits that there are nodes representing abstract concepts, and that these nodes are connected based on their relatedness. For example, in a conceptual network, \"furniture\" might be linked to \"chair,\" which can be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, Brave New World, presents a thought-provoking critique of the intersecting threats of emerging technology and capitalist ideologies. The novel's society, driven by a relentless pursuit of instant gratification, prioritizes communal harmony over individual freedom and autonomy. From a young age, its citizens are conditioned to conform to societal norms, perpetuating a cycle of consumption and obedience.\n\nBy examining the text through the lens of Marxist theory, it becomes evident that Huxley is cautioning against the dangers of systemic control and manipulation. Key concepts like homogenization and reification are woven throughout the narrative, underscoring the author's concerns about the burgeoning capitalist system of his time. The novel's satirical portrayal of consumer culture and the exploitation of the working class is particularly striking, as exemplified by the use of Marxist notions such as false consciousness.\n\nThe concept of false consciousness is exemplified in the novel's portrayal of the lower classes, who are kept in a state of ignorance regarding their true relationships with the ruling elite. This is achieved through the use of hypnopædia, which reinforces a desire for consumption and indulgence above all else. The ruling class, meanwhile, exercises hegemony over the lower classes, maintaining their dominance through a complex web of social and economic control.\n\nThe novel's exploration of social relationships is also telling, as it reveals a society devoid of genuine connections and emotional depth. Interactions between characters are superficial, with a focus on physical appearance and material possessions rather than meaningful human experience. This is particularly evident in the way men discuss women, reducing them to mere objects of admiration, while women's conversations revolve around their physical encounters.\n\nThe characters' complacency with their assigned roles in society serves as a poignant commentary on the effects of capitalist ideology. Their unwavering obedience to the status quo is a testament to the ways in which systemic control can erode individual autonomy and freedom. In this sense, Huxley's novel can be seen as a scathing critique of the ways in which capitalist systems can perpetuate social and economic inequality.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, navigating the campus terrain has proven to be a consistent challenge. For many, myself included, traversing the grounds can be a time-consuming endeavor. Initially residing in an East Halls dorm, situated towards the eastern fringes of the campus, I would often find myself trekking to classes in more centrally located buildings like the Willard complex, a journey that could take up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when inclement weather made the conditions unfavorable. In speaking with an alumnus of similar age, I discovered that the East Halls residence halls were once physically separated from the main campus by extensive vacant land. Subsequently, the now-congested area has been transformed with the addition of sports facilities, new buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and surrounding apartment complexes. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly complicated. The most practical solution to this issue is the bicycle, yet its efficacy relies on not only its presence but also the campus's infrastructure and student participation.\n\nA conversation with a friend who had resumed cycling after a few years of hiatus shed light on the benefits of this mode of transportation. He reflected, \"Bikes are excellent, it wasn't cool to ride them for a period, but they're the best way to get around.\" In addition to providing physical benefits, cycling is an efficient means of transportation, allowing one to cover significant distances on a minimal amount of energy. Like many of my peers, I now reside off-campus, which is just as far from the central campus area as some dorms. Acquiring a bike was one of the most intelligent decisions I made this year. With daily classes in Thomas building, easily a 25-minute walk from my home, cycling can reduce the travel time to just 5 minutes if I pedal at a moderate pace. However, navigating Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my residence, can be hazardous, regardless of the mode of transportation. While walking has its merits, I barely have enough time to attend to my academic responsibilities, let alone walk to classes. If I didn't own a bike, walking would be my sole reliable means of transportation, which would entail an additional 2.5 hours of walking time each week. Considering the time required to walk to and from classes, appointments, and other obligations, this time commitment is unsustainable for me."
