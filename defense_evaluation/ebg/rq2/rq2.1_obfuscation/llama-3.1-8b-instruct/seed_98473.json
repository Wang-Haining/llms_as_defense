            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Through my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to forge a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a meaningful impact on the lives of vulnerable children who have experienced abuse or neglect, as well as provide essential support to troubled families. The guiding principles I plan to uphold in this field include: a commitment to service, respect for individuals and their unique experiences, a strong sense of ethics, and a dedication to fostering positive relationships and personal growth. These core values not only resonate deeply with the social work profession, but are also essential to my own personal growth and development.\n\nPrior to discovering my passion for social work, I grappled with defining my career path. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed individuals struggling to cope with challenges, often relying on unhealthy mechanisms to escape their problems. This exposure led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, yet I still felt uncertain about my long-term career goals. Following my graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to explore my options. It was during this time that I had a pivotal experience that altered my perspective. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was facing a difficult home life. His story touched my heart, and I felt compelled to help. I reached out to the authorities, leveraging my recent graduation in Psychology to facilitate a conversation with the boy's parents. Their dismissive responses and lack of accountability for their actions sparked a realization within me: the need for compassionate, informed support systems in situations like these. This experience solidified my interest in social work, driving me to pursue a career that would enable me to support children and families in crisis.\n\nAnother essential value in the field of social work is social justice. Our society often extols the importance of individuality, yet frequently restricts self-expression and conformity. This paradoxical dynamic has long fascinated me, and I believe that social work offers a unique opportunity to challenge these norms. Throughout my educational journey, I have actively advocated for social justice, embracing individuality and self-expression in my own life. From expressing my personal style through unconventional fashion choices to participating in social justice movements, I have consistently sought to challenge societal expectations and promote inclusivity.",
            "The following dissertation undertakes an in-depth examination of the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in relation to the complex phenomenon of insomnia. The biological paradigm centres around the genetic and physiological determinants of sleep disturbances, while the sociocultural model delves into the environmental and demographic influences that shape our understanding of sleep patterns. This comprehensive review synthesizes existing research to elucidate the intricacies of both models, highlighting key findings and evaluating their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorised into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders comorbid with mental health conditions, or sleep disorders precipitated by medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssonmias, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other related conditions, which are characterised by disturbances in sleep initiation, maintenance, or duration. Conversely, Parasomnias are sleep disorders manifesting as behavioural or physiological abnormalities, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models, with a particular emphasis on the primary sleep disorders.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders posits that genetic and heritable factors, as well as physiological mechanisms, contribute to sleep disturbances. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles. A study employing mice as a model found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for modulating sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, whereas inhibition of this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and enhanced sleep. The administration of the GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This research suggests that animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, revealing a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor may compromise an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are far-reaching, as the inheritance of the phenotype could regulate sleep patterns, and any alterations to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, ultimately affecting various aspects of daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks.",
            "The complexities of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) are multifaceted, encompassing three distinct areas of examination. Initially, a concise overview of this condition is provided, followed by an in-depth exploration of diagnosis, including key indicators or 'red flags.' The paper concludes with practical suggestions for educators in mainstreamed classrooms to support students affected by CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to process auditory information. This entails the efficacious utilization of auditory cues by the central nervous system (CNS), which is responsible for processing and interpreting sound. In essence, individuals afflicted with CAPD can hear sounds within the normal range, yet their brain struggles to decipher and separate distinct auditory inputs, such as speech from background noise (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Consequently, the brain's auditory processing centers fail to function as intended, hindering the ability to comprehend and analyze auditory information.\n\nHistorically, CAPD has been recognized since the mid-1950s under the term 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers during this period, including the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing assessments for children with communication disorders in 1954. Subsequently, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception in 1961 (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The 1977 national conference further catalyzed research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, the ability to distinguish between multiple auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may experience challenges in filtering out background noises, synthesizing sound patterns, and determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre). Moreover, they may struggle to recognize subtle differences in speech, such as detecting sarcasm through changes in tone.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted, encompassing systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists utilize a range of assessments to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally reliable diagnostic tool or test, and the underlying causes of CAPD remain unknown. Diagnostic approaches often involve presenting patients with multiple auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the concept of deception is portrayed as a double-edged sword, capable of both facilitating deception and ultimately leading to self-discovery.  On one hand, adopting a disguise can be a means to achieve temporary protection or gain, as exemplified by Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man. This ruse allows her to survive in a foreign land and secure her safety. However, this disguise also leads to the alienation of her support system, particularly her female peers, thereby rendering her isolated in a setting where she is in need of solace.\n\nFurthermore, Viola's successful impersonation as a man creates a complex situation, where she inadvertently incites romantic feelings in both Olivia and Orsino. Olivia's infatuation with Cesario, Viola's disguise, raises questions about the nature of her true desires, with some speculating that her affections may be rooted in societal expectations rather than genuine attraction. Conversely, Orsino's suppressed emotions towards women are laid bare through his interactions with Cesario, a dynamic that may be seen as a progressive exploration of repressed desires.\n\nThe portrayal of deception in Twelfth Night highlights the intricate relationship between identities, relationships, and deception. By exploring the complexities of disguise, Shakespeare raises fundamental questions about the human need for self-preservation versus the preservation of social bonds. In the end, the play suggests that deception can be a catalyst for self-discovery, but it also underscores the importance of authenticity in our interactions with others.\n\nIn this sense, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on the fluidity of identity and the complexities of human relationships. The play's exploration of deception as a tool for self-discovery challenges the audience to consider the consequences of adopting a false persona and the repercussions on one's relationships and sense of self.",
            "The German colonial administration has been characterized by several notable aspects, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, the colonial empire's multifaceted nature, encompassing diverse policies and governance styles, defies a simplistic characterization. The provision of education across the colonies displayed a similar degree of diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a sizable population of educated and literate Africans, a testament to the effectiveness of German educational initiatives in certain regions. Conversely, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary observers for their quality.\n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a striking disparity. Unlike in East Africa, where the colonial government actively invested in the establishment of state schools and played a significant role in the education of the native population, in South West Africa the responsibility for native education fell largely to missionary organizations that received limited official support. Nevertheless, the government did allocate significant resources towards the education of European settlers in the colony, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation to missionary institutions. The long-term consequences of these educational policies in South West Africa were far-reaching, persisting even after the conclusion of German rule. In contrast, other German colonies boasted a notable number of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. A combination of social, economic, and political factors contributed to this divergent experience, warranting further investigation.\n\nExisting research on education in the German colonial empire is extensive and has been conducted by scholars from a range of backgrounds. The majority of these studies were written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule, with a primary focus on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the scope of inquiry through comparative analyses of education in different German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems of distinct colonies. One of the most notable works is Cohen's comparative study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which sheds light on the factors contributing to the differences between the two colonies. Cohen attributes many of the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to its relatively large settler population.\n\nIn contrast to other German colonies, South West Africa presented a moderately temperate climate, despite being largely dominated by arid desert terrain. The European population in South West Africa capitalized on these relatively favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 settlers residing in the colony by 1913. This figure surpassed the settler population in the colony with the next largest number of European residents, East Africa, which boasted approximately 5,336 settlers at the same time.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has been marked by an explosion of diverse genres, making it increasingly challenging to catalog them comprehensively. Furthermore, many of these genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into numerous sub-genres, further complicating the classification process. One of the most dynamic and expressive genres to emerge in recent decades is heavy metal, which has undergone an extraordinary transformation in the past 40 years.\n\nCharacterized by its emotional depth, heavy metal music tends to explore the darker aspects of the human experience, often with a sense of raw intensity. This genre's versatility has been its hallmark, as artists have continually pushed the boundaries of what is possible, giving rise to an astonishing array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. As a result, the heavy metal movement has become increasingly fragmented, with numerous niches and styles emerging, making it difficult to define its core essence.\n\nTo grasp the complexities of modern metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the factors that have shaped it. Metal is, at its core, a genre that embodies the counterculture ethos of the late 1960s and 1970s, marked by a rejection of mainstream values and a quest for creative freedom. The influence of psychedelic substances during this era contributed to a shift towards more experimental and avant-garde sounds, as artists sought to push the limits of their art. This experimentation led to the development of metal's distinctive sonic characteristics, including its emphasis on volume, intensity, and theatricality.\n\nThe genre's affinity for the darker aspects of human experience has been fueled by its ability to tap into the Romantic Era's fascination with the sublime and the unknown. This is evident in the lyrics of many metal songs, which often explore themes of mortality, existential crises, and the human condition. The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" for example, is often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, and its lyrics reflect the darker, more intense atmosphere that characterized the genre's early days.",
            "A remarkable French artist, Henri Rousseau, predated the surrealist movement by several decades, yet his own artistic explorations of the subconscious were already taking shape in the early 20th century. His 1910 masterpiece, 'The Dream', serves as a poignant reflection of the artist's own aspirations and internal conflicts. Confronted with the daunting task of gaining recognition from the art community, Rousseau found himself torn between the desire for creative autonomy and the pressure to conform to established styles. This dichotomy is perhaps the most prominent theme in 'The Dream', a painting that encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle to reconcile his unique artistic vision with the expectations of the art world.\n\nTo understand the significance of 'The Dream', it is essential to delve into Rousseau's personal history. Born in Laval, a small town in northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau was born into a family with a modest background. His father was a successful tinsmith and hardware merchant, and Rousseau's upbringing was marked by a relatively comfortable upbringing. Despite a lack of formal artistic training, Rousseau began his working life at a young age, eventually finding employment with the French municipal toll service. His role as a gabelou, or toll collector, would later be rebranded as a douanier, or customs inspector, a moniker that would become synonymous with his artistic persona.\n\nThe loss of his first wife, Clémence, who died alongside eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one daughter, Julia, and a profound sense of grief. As a means of coping with his emotional pain, Rousseau turned to painting, seeking solace in the creative process. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's artwork was rooted in his own experiences and the realities of everyday life. His desire for recognition and acceptance from the art world is all the more understandable given his late start in life and the presence of more established artists, such as Matisse, who was gaining recognition during the same period.\n\nJan Gordon, author of Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse and Rousseau were technically competitors in the art world, they differed fundamentally in their approaches and motivations. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to create works that were so conventional that they would earn him a place within the Artiste Français circle.",
            "In the realm of human understanding, a profound interplay exists between the realms of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. This intricate connection has long been acknowledged by some of the most discerning minds, including John Keats, who, in his celebrated \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" poignantly captures the essence of this relationship, stating, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While education and experience shape our comprehension of the world, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics often transcends these conventional bounds, echoing Keats' words.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics aim to elucidate rather than dictate, striving to explain the underlying qualities that render a work of art or literature beautiful or an action morally sound, rather than prescribing a set of rigid guidelines. A closer examination of art and morality reveals that our interpretations often meander around the periphery, discussing aspects like composition, cultural context, or historical significance, yet somehow fall short of capturing the quintessence of what makes something truly remarkable. When discussing a favorite work, it's common to hear a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth analysis. This phenomenon suggests that both art and morality possess an intrinsic quality that cannot be fully encapsulated by description.\n\nAs Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" This notion resonates with the notion that ethics, too, has a transcendent quality that defies complete articulation. Ludwig Wittgenstein's assertion, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental,\" underscores the elusive nature of ethics. I propose that this enigmatic aspect is, in fact, the most potent characteristic of both ethics and aesthetics, serving as a unifying thread between the two.\n\nThis profound connection is particularly evident in literature, where the intersection of art and morality is most pronounced. As McKean astutely notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" While moral standards may be less relevant in other art forms, such as music, they seem to be an intrinsic aspect of literature, speaking to the very fabric of human existence. As McKean further remarks, \"Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern identity is marked by a unique blend of cultural influences, spanning from the Alpine foothills of southern Germany to the Baltic coast in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is woven together across various cities, including München, Köln, and Dresden, each with its distinct character shaped by its geographical location. Despite its contemporary unity, Germany's rich cultural heritage stems from a diverse array of historical sources and tribal influences.\n\nThe origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians offering various explanations. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested that the name might be derived from the Tungrian tribe, which was known to the Romans as \"Germans\" prior to their crossing of the Rhine River and their conflict with Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98 AD). In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germanic tribes that remained beyond the Rhine. Caesar's use of the term was likely inspired by the Gauls themselves, who may have referred to their Germanic neighbors by this name. In his account of the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes that the Germans, who lived beyond the Rhine, were engaged in almost daily battles with the Gauls (Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nAlternative etymologies propose that the term \"German\" might be connected to the spear, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which could imply that the Germans were known for their loud or boisterous nature. \n\nTacitus' work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in 98 AD, provides valuable insights into the early history of the Germanic peoples. In this treatise, Tacitus describes the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences through immigration or cultural exchange. He notes that those who would venture to Germany would have been drawn by its harsh climate, rugged terrain, and unique cultural landscape. While the Romans did engage in military campaigns in Germania, they generally did not settle there permanently, preferring to maintain a presence on the periphery of the Roman Empire. Instead, the Germanic tribes interacted with the Romans through trade and by serving in the Roman military, bringing their skills and goods to the Roman world (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "As I gazed down, my mind temporarily blanketed itself against the visual stimuli before me. I observed without emotional attachment or speculation, adopting an almost detached awareness of the scene unfolding before my eyes. My thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness at a pace that left little room for reflection. In this state, I seemed to exist solely as a conduit for the sensory information I was processing.\n\nI had long been fascinated with the idea of creating visual representations of the world, a curiosity that began when I was six years old. The discovery of 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' by an artist I had the opportunity to work with reignited this passion. This book delves into the fundamental principles of drawing, from understanding the basic tools to processing visual information. One technique that particularly resonated with me was the exercise of framing a subject with a square boundary, allowing the complex to be distilled into its most essential elements.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I was overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of the visual data. I failed to mentally impose the artist's frame, and my mind was flooded with the intricate details of the scene. I stood transfixed, my thoughts in a state of suspended animation.\n\nAs I reflect on the artistic process, I am reminded of the unique styles of masters like Picasso, Monet, and the Italian Renaissance artists. If I were to consider myself an artist, I would view this moment as the inception of my creative journey, the beginning of my artistic odyssey, titled 'Work in Brown'.\n\nI tentatively reached for my chosen medium, my hand instinctively guiding it through the air. My muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand connected with the object, giving shape and form to my creative expression. Water, serene and smooth, seemed to flow through my thoughts, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me. But then, my hand jerked back, and I found myself violently gripping the toilet handle once more. The stubborn brown package refused to budge, stuck fast like a slug on the toilet's surface.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, my feet shoulder-width apart, I frowned in distaste as I gazed at the unappealing remnants of human waste left behind for the janitorial staff to clean up. The need for a solution was clear, and with a few more deliberate movements, I managed to dislodge the offending item. With the crisis averted, I turned my attention to the wall to my right and grasped the sheet of toilet paper, began to unravel it, and eventually formed it into a makeshift mitt. Standing up straight, I then bent at the waist, and my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, much like a mother carefully placing a turkey into the oven on Thanksgiving Day.",
            "The alarming trend of youthful fatalities behind the wheel is a pressing concern in the United States. A multifaceted analysis reveals that a combination of factors contributes to this daunting statistic. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that the adolescent brain is not yet fully equipped to handle the complexities of driving, underscoring the significance of inexperience in this context. Novice drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents, as well as vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a noteworthy correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. It is a well-documented phenomenon that teenagers often engage in peer-driven activities, which only exacerbates the situation.\n\nTo address this issue, several states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit underage passengers. However, this measure is merely a temporary solution, as the root problem lies in the inherent limitations of young drivers. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that the desire for risk-taking among adolescents, particularly those under the age of 20, is a significant factor in the high accident rate. This propensity for thrill-seeking makes it prudent to delay the issuance of full driver's licenses until this tendency has diminished.\n\nIf we continue to grant licenses to young teens, we can expect a significant increase in fatalities. With the Baby Boomer generation's offspring approaching driving age, the number of new teen drivers will surge, potentially leading to a staggering death toll in the coming years.\n\nLegislative action on this matter would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education courses as a precursor to obtaining a full license, while restricting access to motor vehicles for those under 18. A provisional permit could still be issued, accompanied by a set number of practical driving hours, which could be based on existing state requirements (e.g., California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice).\n\nGiven the nationwide scope of the issue, uniform federal legislation would be a logical and effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country. This proposal is not a novel concept, but rather a much-needed step towards mitigating the risks associated with teenage driving.",
            "During an investigation of the early cinematic archive at the Library of Congress, I opted to analyze the collection of trick films produced by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. A total of fifteen films were examined, showcasing the creative use of editing techniques to craft illusions. My research primarily focused on dissecting the aesthetic principles governing trick films and identifying the anomalies evident in several later productions. Notably, these early trick films were largely confined to a static setting with a frontal presentation, adhering to a strict convention of stationary camera shots and adhering to a one-to-one shot ratio. However, a few pioneering films at the turn of the century deviated from these conventions, introducing novel elements such as multiple shot compositions.\n\nOne common thread among the trick films was their filming within a contained, proscenium-framed set. The camera remained fixed in its position, refraining from panning or following subjects. This visual approach drew inspiration from theatre and vaudeville traditions, as well as the aesthetics of magic performances. One limitation inherent in this format was that characters generally moved horizontally, never approaching or receding from the camera. A prime example can be seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right side and traverse the stage, occasionally disappearing from view without the camera tracking their movement.\n\nThe proscenium-style composition also resulted in predominantly long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were entirely absent from the Edison catalog of trick films, echoing the conventions of live theatre and vaudeville, where the entire performance was presented within a framed space. As a result, characters rarely moved towards the camera, precluding the use of close-ups. The majority of trick films conformed to a pattern of one conceptual shot equating to one physical shot, which imposed a time constraint of approximately one minute or less, contingent on the frame rate. This linear narrative structure often confined trick films to short, vaudeville-inspired tricks, such as illusions, disappearances, and quick-change sequences with minimal storytelling. Notably, however, this apparent unity often belies a more complex construction, where a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple physical shots combined to create an illusion. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, exemplifies this technique, where a closer examination reveals the onset of the physical shot depicting Mary's beheaded body, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the principles of Republicanism, which guided his views on governance and individual freedom. As an agriculturalist, he forged a unique perspective that blended his profession's emphasis on self-sufficiency with his limited experience in politics. This distinct blend of outlooks earned him a reputation as a steadfast champion of personal liberties and a vocal critic of government overreach.\n\nTaylor's agrarian ideals served as the foundation for his opinions on state sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary. He believed that a well-structured agrarian society was the key to a harmonious and thriving community, and that this ideal should be the guiding force behind government policy.\n\nThe notion that the United States had a clean slate, untainted by existing power structures, presented a remarkable opportunity to establish a truly self-governing system. Taylor firmly believed in the inherent value of natural rights, which he saw as interconnected and mutually dependent. He argued that the erosion of one right would imperil the entire system, thereby diminishing the worth of those remaining. Consequently, these rights should remain beyond the reach of government intervention.\n\nIn his vision for an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must balance the innate duality of human nature – encompassing both goodness and malevolence. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to conclude that governments, like their constituents, are inherently flawed. He famously observed, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., p. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agricultural prosperity, and harness the power of capitalism for the greater good. Conversely, a government founded on such principles would operate equitably, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration.\n\nTaylor's stance on self-interest was nuanced: while it was a fundamental driver of human action, it became pernicious only when it led to the exploitation of others. A responsible government, he believed, must acknowledge and manage the darker aspects of human nature to prevent the introduction of pernicious principles.\n\nSimilar to many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, one that limited the federal government's authority to the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be costly and prone to despotism, yet he cautioned that a literal interpretation devoid of context could prove equally hazardous. Moreover, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more eloquently articulated the nation's status as a confederation of sovereign states.",
            "Upon examining the data presented in Figure 17, a notable decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project is evident. This trend may be attributed to several factors. The onset of winter at a New England institution likely resulted in a reduction in biking and walking commutes. Furthermore, the conclusion of the fall semester, coupled with the subsequent holiday season, may have diverted individuals' attention away from the project. The typical December break also presents a challenge, as students and faculty often take time off during this period, potentially reducing the need for campus visits. Following the winter break, the resumption of classes in late January might have contributed to a brief uptick in activity. However, the relatively low number of submissions in February remains a puzzle. It is also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, a phenomenon that can be mitigated through targeted initiatives. \n\nTo counteract this decline, the Carpool Challenge Week campaign was implemented in March, yielding a significant increase in log submissions for that month. This experience highlights the importance of maintaining momentum and addressing the unique challenges posed by academic breaks. Additionally, the project's reliance on alternative modes of transportation is hindered by cultural preferences for personal transportation. To overcome this obstacle, incentives such as gift certificates to local businesses were provided. While these proved effective, it would be intriguing to explore the impact of more substantial prizes, including eco-friendly vehicles, on participation levels. Adjusting the value and variety of incentives throughout the project's duration may have helped sustain engagement and prevent the observed dip in activity. For instance, announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, during the winter break or at the beginning of the spring semester, could have potentially boosted participation and enthusiasm.",
            "The investment landscape is home to a variety of financial instruments, among which exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a unique blend of characteristics. By tracking an index, commodity, or a curated basket of assets, ETFs strike a balance between the diversification of index funds and the flexibility of individual stock ownership. This hybrid model allows for the benefits of short selling, margin buying, and the purchase of minimal shares in any transaction, often at a lower expense ratio compared to the average mutual fund. However, investors should be aware that ETF trading incurs commission fees, similar to those associated with stock transactions. Moreover, the availability of numerous ETF options can be a double-edged sword, as it may lead to information overload and decision paralysis.\n\nIn this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF and scrutinize its top 10 holdings, which collectively comprise 63.58% of the fund's assets. By examining the constituent stocks, we can assess whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. Additionally, we will investigate whether a tailored configuration of these stocks could potentially yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we will concentrate on the top 10 holdings, which account for a significant proportion of the ETF's assets. By normalizing the current percentage of assets to 100%, we can estimate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming the portfolio is comprised entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The accompanying chart provides the calculated values for beta and return.\n\nA cursory examination of the data reveals that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a return approximately 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Conversely, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer a more advantageous risk-return profile. Nevertheless, it is crucial to verify whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of these findings, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF. This will enable us to assess whether the accumulated volatility of the top 10 holdings is meaningfully different from that of the ETF.",
            "In a notable work, Poe has demonstrated mastery of the poetic craft. His poem \"Dream-Land\" showcases his ability to weave together disparate elements in a rich tapestry of sound and symbolism. Notably, in lines 6 and 56, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference that can be traced back to the Roman poet Virgil. However, a more nuanced understanding of this allusion is warranted. While Virgil's use of the term is well-documented, it is also indebted to a more recent literary influence. Poe's fascination with German literature is well-documented, and his exposure to the works of Goethe would have been a significant factor in shaping his writing.\n\nA key aspect of Poe's relationship with Goethe is highlighted by the similarity between their respective poems. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" observes that Poe's work exhibits a clear debt to Goethe's style. This observation is reinforced by the fact that Goethe's magnum opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" was widely disseminated in the early 19th century. The second part of this work, published in 1832, contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, following the death of his wife, succumbs to despair and ultimately takes his own life.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the speaker of \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Both characters are haunted by loss and driven to the brink of madness by their circumstances. The King's descent into darkness and despair serves as a poignant commentary on the human condition, one that Poe likely drew upon in his own work. The fact that both poems share a similar thematic preoccupation with the abyss of human suffering suggests a deep engagement with Goethe's ideas.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" serves as a testament to the interconnectedness of his oeuvre. In both poems, the term functions as a bookend, framing the speaker's journey into the unknown. The landscape of Thulé, with its dark and lonely expanse, serves as a bleak counterpoint to the vibrant world of the speaker's imagination. This dichotomy is echoed in \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's descent into madness is precipitated by his loss and isolation.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is also evident in his admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe's respect for Tennyson, a fellow poet of great renown, would have likely exposed him to Goethe's work. Furthermore, the widespread dissemination of Goethe's writings in the early 19th century would have ensured that his ideas and themes were widely available to poets like Poe.",
            "A shopper who tripped and fell on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store might potentially be awarded punitive damages if the store manager's actions were deemed reckless and intentional, given that he was informed twice of the spill but failed to clean it up for a half-hour because he was taking a break to eat dinner.\n\nA court is unlikely to entirely dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To be eligible for punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result, as well as show that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer will likely argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had already slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident. Furthermore, despite this knowledge, he still failed to take action to address the spill. Palmer's assertion that Martin's actions were reprehensible might not be as persuasive, but it is still a valid argument, considering the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, alerted his manager, Paul Martin, to an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on a break and unable to address the issue at that time. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, but he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California Civil Code Section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it involves a conscious disregard of a plaintiff's rights when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.

            "My interest in Islam was initially sparked by a college course I took about four years ago at the CBC.  The class engaged in a lively discussion about the nature of Islam, with some students questioning whether it's inherently a hostile religion.  As I reflect on the intervening years, I've observed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam in the United States, moving from a predominantly negative to a more tolerant perspective.  This transformation is particularly striking when considering the candidacy of Barack Obama, whose family background includes Muslim heritage, and who rose to prominence in the early 2000s.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad is a subject that fascinates me.  Learning more about his biography has led me to reevaluate my initial understanding of his character.  I was under the impression that Muhammad was a figure who coerced conversions and expanded his influence through conquest.  However, the biography paints a different picture – one of a humble individual who embodied a sense of self-awareness and compassion.  According to the narrative, people were drawn to his teachings as they came to appreciate his message and character.\n\nInterestingly, I've noticed parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying food to feed a group of men.  This style of storytelling may suggest that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble figure who didn't need to prove himself, but rather allowed his message and actions to speak for themselves.  I find this approach problematic, as it downplays the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThe biography also includes anecdotes that appear to serve as testimony to the validity of Muhammad's message.  These accounts often originate from secondary sources, making it challenging to verify their accuracy.  While the intention behind these stories may have been to provide evidence, I felt they diminished the authenticity of the narrative and made it harder to discern fact from fiction.\n\nWhat I find most unsettling about this work is its attempt to depict Muhammad as an exemplary figure, emphasizing his humility, kindness, and wisdom.  However, historical records raise questions about the accuracy of this portrayal.  I'm left wondering whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A thread of divergence can be observed in the Christian narrative as it evolved beyond the life of Jesus.  If we examine the trajectory of Christian thought, we notice a gradual drift from its foundational roots.  The trajectory suggests an increasing awareness of history and a growing inclination towards progressive ideas.  While traditionalists remain steadfast in their convictions, their influence may not be sufficient to sway the broader movement.  As the years unfold, a heightened awareness of historical context is likely to emerge.  There will be a growing desire to distinguish between the accumulated doctrines of Christianity and the original intent of its namesake.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  the trend in Christian history will reverse, leading to a return to the original form.  A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of dogma, much like a reversal of time, until only the essence of Jesus' teachings remains.  As this shift gains traction in the United States and Europe, it will spread, influencing the masses to adopt a more authentic, Jesus-centric approach to faith.  The institutional church will continue to play a guiding role, but the theological landscape will undergo a significant transformation.  The proliferation of diversity within Christendom will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  Regional and denominational differences will diminish, replaced by a growing sense of shared understanding.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the Roman Empire's transition from persecution to Christian dominance, and the transformation of the United States from a society that enslaved to one that empowered African Americans.  A similar reversal is imminent in the Christian faith, one that will seek to reclaim the origins of the religion and reduce diversity in the process.  A key factor in this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal.  If we look back in time, we find the theological underpinnings of Christianity rooted in Judaism.  By the time the Romans seized control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish faith had already developed a strong foundation, centered on monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  The Jewish population was not homogeneous, with various sects like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people each holding distinct beliefs and practices.",
            "One of the underlying themes in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle is the inherent self-interest and callousness of individuals when it comes to the well-being of others. This is exemplified by the factory owners and managers who prioritize their own success and the growth of their businesses above all else, disregarding the potential consequences for the environment and their employees. The vivid description of the factories, as seen in the passage, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" effectively captures the devastating impact of industrialization on the environment and the community. Sinclair highlights the owners' disregard for the harm caused by pollution and the poor conditions surrounding the factories, such as the animal waste and runoff from the pens.\n\nFurthermore, Sinclair illustrates the exploitative nature of the factory owners and managers through their treatment of employees. They are willing to push their workers to their limits, forcing them to work long hours without adequate compensation or concern for their well-being. The quote \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\" effectively conveys the toxic atmosphere of the factories. The lack of regulation and safety measures during the time period allowed the owners to take advantage of their employees, often laying them off without warning or support.\n\nThe novel portrays the workers as being trapped in a system with limited options for escape. They were often forced to live in squalid conditions and work in hazardous environments, with no access to resources or support to improve their situation. The formation of unions, often seen as a means of empowerment for workers, was instead exploited by those in power, further entrenching the problems faced by the working class. The comparison to slavery, as seen in the statement \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\" is a powerful indictment of the system and the treatment of workers during this time.",
            "In the realm of literary technique, authors often employ various methods to elicit a specific emotional response from their readers. While some methods prove more effective than others, F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. One such approach involves juxtaposing an adjective with a noun in an unconventional manner to create a particular aura around a subject. Alternatively, Fitzgerald assigns meaning to a symbol, which he later leverages to evoke a particular emotional response.\n\nFitzgerald's use of symbolism, particularly with regards to colors, is a prime example of this technique. In The Great Gatsby, he establishes a rich tapestry of meanings surrounding several hues, including white, gray, and the reddish-pink spectrum. By consistently associating these colors with specific emotions and connotations, Fitzgerald crafts a nuanced narrative that resonates with readers. In the novel, Fitzgerald skillfully employs the symbolism of white and gray to convey the themes of uniformity, exclusivity, and the passage of time.\n\nThroughout the novel, Fitzgerald sets the tone for these colors by repeatedly depicting them in everyday contexts. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are frequently clad in white, while Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's party. Even the narrator's descriptions of the cityscape and social gatherings reinforce this association, as evidenced by the \"gaudy primary colors\" that pervade Gatsby's party. By assigning these colors to mundane subjects, Fitzgerald reinforces their significance and establishes a sense of unity. This becomes particularly evident in Nick's descriptions of his daily commute and the \"uniform\" facades of apartment buildings.\n\nHowever, Fitzgerald also employs these colors to convey a sense of uniformity and monotony, particularly in relation to Daisy. After establishing the symbolic meaning of white and gray, he begins to associate them with Daisy's character, depicting her as a uniform, almost interchangeable part of Gatsby's world. Her appearance in a \"little white roadster\" serves as a turning point, where readers begin to perceive her as a mere accessory, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. This technique is further reinforced by other instances, such as the \"gray haze\" surrounding her fur collar and her repeated appearances in white dresses.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural industry thrives due to the region's pleasant, sunny climate. The local agricultural scene encompasses a diverse array of crops, including but not limited to tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits such as peaches and lemons, as well as berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for locally produced, organic community-supported agriculture products is substantial, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such sustainable agricultural endeavors allow landowners to capitalize on government programs while fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between land use and habitat conservation, thereby creating opportunities for educational programs, farm tours, and revenue generation.\n\nIn addition to addressing a potentially lucrative market niche, organic farming often yields numerous ecological benefits, including increased biodiversity in local plant and animal species due to the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. Nevertheless, organic farming comes with some drawbacks. It typically demands more manual labor and specialized management to control pests and weeds and to maintain soil health without synthetic chemicals. Losses can be higher than those experienced with conventional farming methods, and small-scale organic farms often face operational inefficiencies compared to larger operations. Furthermore, other beneficial land management practices unrelated to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats or open spaces, can also incur greater labor costs.\n\nThe specific parcel chosen for this scenario is situated near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and encompasses 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This land is located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including several endangered species such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as species that are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, such as the burrowing owl.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native American communities for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood vendors in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of a historic homestead patent and likely served as a grazing area and/or a woodlot for many decades.\n\nTo illustrate the potential challenges and opportunities for a small farmer operating in this region, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched relevant government programs that could help mitigate costs and support wildlife-friendly agricultural practices. I then identified an organic farm in the same area to serve as a model for a hypothetical farm operation.",
            "The dynamics of cultural influence are profound in the negotiation process. However, it's essential to acknowledge that culture can be multifaceted and far-reaching, encompassing not only what it represents but also what it omits. A culture's characteristics cannot be distilled into a single, monolithic entity. Stereotypical assertions such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"the Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the complexities of cultural identity. While general understandings can provide a foundation, it's more productive for negotiators to delve deeper into the nuances of a culture's significance and how it impacts the negotiation. By contextualizing a culture's influence within the specific context of the negotiation, one can better navigate potential challenges.\n\nEngaging with a foreign culture requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing aspects such as historical context, societal norms, and inherent biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's crucial to accept and respect its distinctiveness, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where power dynamics are at play. In foreign territories, embracing local customs and traditions can facilitate smoother negotiations and foster a more collaborative environment.\n\nIt's worth noting that cultural identity extends beyond national or international boundaries. Corporate cultures within a nation can be just as distinct as national cultures. For example, organizational cultures may prioritize long working hours or a more relaxed work-life balance. Observable signs of a corporate culture include dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The varying approaches to philanthropy among companies – some encouraging individual initiative, while others restrict it to approved channels – illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Even within the United States, company cultures can differ significantly, with regional and urban-rural variations adding to the complexity. A uniform exterior can belie a rich tapestry of values and practices waiting to be explored.\n\nUnderstanding values is essential, as they provide the underlying motivations that drive cultural behavior. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony are paramount, a negotiator will likely avoid public embarrassment or conflict to achieve a successful outcome. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize hard-driving negotiations, settlement at the earliest opportunity may not be the primary goal. By considering these general characteristics, negotiators can better prepare for the negotiation table. Nevertheless, gaining insight into an opponent's personal values can significantly enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "In a foundational passage of the Christian Bible, Psalm 14, a profound notion is articulated: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This passage serves as the starting point for the philosophical inquiry of St. Anselm, who also grapples with the concept of the divine in his own work. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas, another prominent thinker, shares similarities with Anselm in his arguments for the existence of a higher power. Given that both authors are advocating for the same theological position, it is essential to acknowledge, for the sake of comparison, that they are both operating within the framework of a monotheistic deity – one that aligns with the traditional understanding of the Christian God. By assuming this common ground, we can effectively examine their arguments without introducing variables that might skew the comparison. Nevertheless, I would contend that, despite the merits of each author's reasoning, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in the divine.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's consider Anselm's central argument. His philosophical approach involves a introspective exploration of the human mind, seeking to uncover evidence of the divine within oneself. Anselm argues that the concept of God's existence is inherent to our understanding, and therefore, we cannot negate it. This idea, while articulated in Anselm's unique terminology, essentially suggests that the proof for God lies in the depths of our own consciousness. He posits that an individual need not rely on external validation, as the truth of God's existence is self-evident within the human mind. This perspective is rooted in the notion of faith, which, within Christian theology, refers to the acceptance of truths that transcend empirical verification.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a reasoning that relies exclusively on logical and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach has significant implications for the practice of evangelism in Christianity, as it would enable the conversion of new adherents without relying on their willingness to accept the unknowable. Aquinas develops five distinct rational arguments – involving change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate the logical necessity of God's existence. Each argument presents a compelling case for the existence of a higher power, one that can be discerned through the logical assembly of observable phenomena. By examining the characteristics of a puzzle, we can infer the presence of a missing piece, even if we have not directly observed it.",
            "Emerging in the distant past, circa the 5th or 6th century BCE, an individual destined for greatness would come to be known as the Buddha. As the years unfolded, he would renounce worldly life and attain profound enlightenment, laying the groundwork for Buddhism—a faith that has evolved significantly over the centuries. Approximately 2,500 years have elapsed since its inception, and its current manifestations bear little resemblance to the original teachings. This phenomenon can be observed in various forms, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. This celebration, while devoid of direct scriptural endorsement, serves as a testament to the dynamic nature of the faith. From the most superficial customs to the fundamental principles of the religion, the Theravada Buddhist community has undergone transformations both from internal and external influences, some benevolent and others hostile.\n\nA critical understanding of the subject necessitates the clarification of certain key terms. The dichotomy between internal and external forces will be a recurring theme in this discussion. An internal force refers to a change originating from within the Buddhist community, irrespective of monastic status. Conversely, an external force denotes any influence exerted by non-Buddhists. A hostile force is characterized by its intent to harm or undermine the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of the faith. In contrast, a benign force is one that neither actively seeks to harm nor assist the community, though its consequences may vary.\n\nTo establish a solid foundation for this analysis, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. The core principles of the faith revolve around the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, comprising the Tripitaka, is the collection of sacred texts that form the basis of Buddhist thought. The Tripitaka consists of three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining the disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, encompassing the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central to these notions are the concepts of Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all phenomena). The recognition of these principles is crucial for transcending the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and for ultimately overcoming the afflictions of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) that accompany enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for laymen, including the five precepts: refraining from harming, lying, stealing, causing harm through illicit behavior, and consuming intoxicating substances. Monks, on the other hand, are subject to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the Four Noble Truths: 1) the existence of Dukkha; 2) the role of attachment in perpetuating suffering; and 3) the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "Bilateral tensions between the United States and Mexico exemplify a long-standing rivalry that persisted for over five decades. From 1836 to 1893, the two nations engaged in a series of confrontations that would eventually subside before the onset of World War I (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The conflict reached its zenith during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States secure Texas and the American Southwest as new territories following a decisive victory over Mexico. The rivalry's trajectory was marked by recurring clashes, including territorial disputes, cultural differences, and competing interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis phenomenon is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship. Neighboring countries often experience rivalries stemming from conflicting interests, cultural disparities, and historical animosities. The United States and Mexico are situated in a comparable context, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations that have posed long-standing diplomatic challenges for the United States (p. 41). Both countries' geographical proximity to the US has contributed to their rivalry, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed more cordial relationships with the US.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations, a recurring theme in international conflicts throughout history (Frahm 2001, p. 86). The ideological underpinnings of the rivalry were rooted in the US's historical opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, which was inherited from the English and Spanish colonial powers. This legacy of mistrust hindered the establishment of a harmonious foreign relationship between the US and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 instances of disputes between the US and Mexico during the 57-year period of rivalry, with the majority of these incidents revolving around territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems (p. 145). The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge, which was eventually mitigated through joint military efforts by both nations (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry between the US and Mexico began to subside as Mexico's economic dependence on the US increased (Schmitt 1974, p. 109), and eventually dissipated as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been a monumental fifteen years since I was suddenly struck down by an illness that shook the very foundations of my existence. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession as a means of securing a sense of stability and comfort that had long eluded me during my tumultuous childhood. The notion that I would always have a steady means of income proved to be a comforting mantra, one that led me to forgo my initial aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist, opting instead for the relative security of a traditional nursing career.\n\nHowever, life had other plans. At the age of 46, I found myself single, financially strained, and unable to work. The years that followed have been a grueling struggle, with Social Security Disability serving as my primary lifeline. Despite my resilience, each day presents a daunting challenge to my well-being, self-esteem, and sense of security. The uncertainty that pervades my life is a harsh reality, one that I have come to accept.\n\nYet, amidst this turmoil, there is one constant that has sustained me: the unwavering support of my loved ones and a handful of close friends. These individuals have been my rock, providing a sense of security and stability that I thought I had left behind. Their selflessness has taught me that true strength lies not in individual resilience, but in the bonds we form with others.\n\nMy experience has instilled in me a profound appreciation for the importance of community and mutual support. In a world where uncertainty is an ever-present reality, it is essential that we learn to rely on one another, to trust in the goodness of those around us. This is a lesson that our nation would do well to remember, particularly in the face of adversity.\n\nWhile it is wise to be prepared for the unexpected, I firmly believe that our society's emphasis on rugged individualism is misguided. The pioneers who settled our great nation did not succeed through self-reliance alone; it was their ability to come together, to share resources and offer support that ultimately led them to their destinations.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, I have taken steps to ensure my preparedness for potential emergencies. I possess a well-stocked disaster kit, complete with essential supplies and a plan for self-sufficiency. However, I firmly believe that the most critical component of any disaster plan is the relationships we nurture with those around us. By fostering a sense of community and trust, we can create a network of support that will see us through even the most trying times.\n\nIn a world where uncertainty reigns, it is essential that we recognize the value of interdependence. By embracing this concept, we can build stronger, more resilient communities that are better equipped to weather the storms of life. So, let us not merely focus on individual preparedness, but also on cultivating the relationships that will ultimately be our greatest source of strength.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a subject of ongoing inquiry. While D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that biologists struggle to define even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms still resonates today, recent advances in mathematical modeling have expanded our understanding of mollusk development. Specifically, researchers have applied statistical models to the development and evolution of shell morphology in mollusks, as exemplified by the work of Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur study aims to investigate the role of mathematical modeling in elucidating the mechanisms governing evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. By combining mathematical modeling with experimental and descriptive studies, we seek to better comprehend the constraints that shape the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change. To achieve this, we employed X-radiographic imaging of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then incorporated into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995) to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change.\n\nThe shell of a mollusk can be conceptualized as a spiral structure that traverses a three-dimensional space over time, comprising a series of whorls that spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated from the next by a continuous line, or suture. In most shells, the final whorl, or body whorl, is the largest, while the spire consists of all whorls except the final one. The apex and base of the shell are defined by the tip of the spire and the opposite end, respectively, and the animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views, with the conventional orientation being apertural, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, one should first observe the shell from the apical view and determine the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nBy tracing the path of the aperture through time and space as the animal constructs its shell, it is possible to represent the shell's development graphically and mathematically. This enables the formulation of a mathematical model, which can then be used to investigate the effects of varying parameters on the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The stagnation of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia over the past decade stands in stark contrast to the country's progress in achieving other Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets.  Despite this, the slow pace of improvement in child and maternal health indicators suggests that additional efforts are necessary to meet the 2015 targets.  A closer examination of the factors contributing to these sluggish advancements reveals a pressing need to bolster the country's overall health infrastructure, rather than solely focusing on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in increasing the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% currently meeting this benchmark.  However, this metric includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the medical expertise to respond to complications during pregnancy, resulting in a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhaging.  Consequently, the apparent progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and further work is required to address the underlying issues.  Moreover, a notable decline in the number of children under five treated by a health professional for diarrheal diseases is a cause for concern.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, the current rates across the country are alarmingly low.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate in Indonesia remains below the expected threshold, at approximately 4%.  This figure is particularly striking in light of the considerable disparity between urban and rural areas, with cesarean rates of 7% in urban settings and a paltry 2% in rural regions.  This stark contrast highlights the unequal distribution of healthcare services, with a clear bias towards urban areas.  Furthermore, the significant gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest quintiles, amounting to 27%, underscores the issue of vertical equity.  The poor are disproportionately hindered in accessing healthcare services, largely due to the financial burden of out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn charting a course for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question arises: how to most effectively address the dearth of services.  Specifically, should Indonesia adopt targeted programmatic approaches or prioritize strengthening its overall health system, without compromising on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and infants.  While program-specific initiatives may offer a tempting solution, they come with significant drawbacks.  One major concern is that investing heavily in a particular area can divert resources away from other vital sectors, leading to a brain drain of skilled personnel towards more resource-rich areas, as seen in the case of the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on the family planning sector.  Moreover, the proliferation of parallel programs for a single area can result in duplication of services, inefficiencies, and an overwhelming burden of paperwork and administrative tasks.",
            "The Victorian era is marked by its fastidious attention to minute particulars and its preoccupation with the upper echelons of society.  However, two novels that diverge from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, both of which incorporate elements of enigma and a penchant for the unconventional, characteristics that deviate from the standard expectations of the period. These unconventional aspects serve to heighten the depth of character within each narrative, providing a more nuanced understanding of their motivations and emotional landscapes.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is underscored by vivid and unsettling visions that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. A telling example of this is evident in the following passage from the novel, where the protagonist's thoughts are consumed by a maelstrom of disorienting ideas:\n\n\"As he walked, the din of argument between Sikes and Crackit receded into the background, their words echoing in his mind. But when he focused his attention, he found himself locked in a heated conversation with them. Sudden gunfire shattered the air, and a cacophony of cries and shouts erupted around him. He felt an unseen force propelling him through the chaos, as his senses reeled from the proximity of pain.\"\n\nThis technique is often employed through the use of dream sequences or dreamlike states in both novels, though the specific purpose and execution differ in each. In Oliver Twist, such visions frequently offer insights into Oliver's inner world, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of Oliver's shooting in chapter 28 is a poignant example of this, where the traumatic event is relived in vivid detail, underscoring the protagonist's lack of agency in the face of adversity. The passage highlights Oliver's disorientation and despair, as his senses are overwhelmed by the shock of pain, which has become a constant and debilitating presence in his life.\n\nThe question of culpability for Oliver's misfortune is thus raised, as it is clear that his fate is not entirely his own. The passage implies a sense of powerlessness on Oliver's part, as if he is unable to exert control over the events unfolding around him, even when his very life is at stake. Furthermore, the narrative suggests a growing sense of resignation in Oliver, as if he has been worn down by the relentless pressures of his circumstances, rendering him increasingly unable to resist or react to his environment.\n\nIn this same vein, another passage from the novel captures the disorienting quality of time, where the protagonist's perceptions of day and night are distorted:\n\n\"The day had passed – or rather, it had not. Time seemed to be in a state of flux, with day and night blurring into one another in an endless cycle of darkness and light.\"",
            "My experience as an after-school program tutor for elementary students has given me a unique perspective on the challenges of language barriers in education, particularly in California. I recall a particular case that still resonates with me – a student named Adrian, who was experiencing reading difficulties despite speaking perfect English. What struck me was the irregularity of his reading struggles, which hinted at an underlying issue. As it turned out, Adrian was familiar with the English language but lacked a solid grasp of the alphabet and pronunciation. This experience has stuck with me, and I've come to realize that even native English speakers can face substantial obstacles when it comes to reading.\n\nThis experience serves as a testament to the complexities of addressing language barriers in schools. It's not always immediately apparent, even in students who seem to have a strong command of the language. In Adrian's case, targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no one-size-fits-all approach; a combination of strategies is necessary.\n\nOne potential solution is the dual language education system. Research has shown that students participating in two-way bilingual programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and limited benefits, the benefits of these programs extend to all students, not just those with Spanish as their first language. By implementing these programs as the norm rather than the exception, we can unlock academic success for all students.\n\nTo make this a reality, we don't need to require every teacher to be bilingual. That would be impractical and unrealistic. Instead, we can utilize bilingual support staff, such as tutors or instructional aids, to complement the instruction. This approach would allow us to provide students with the support they need to succeed, regardless of their linguistic background. By combining effective teaching methods, bilingual support, and a commitment to inclusivity, we can create a more equitable educational environment for all students.",
            "The notion that there exists something greater than ourselves has been an enduring theme in human perception from an early age. This concept is often explored through various forms of spiritual inquiry, whether it's a Sunday school education, a temple visit, or introspective contemplation. Many adhere to the faith passed down from their ancestors, while others reject it altogether, convinced that their personal universe is the only truth. People frequently oscillate between different value systems as they navigate their own spiritual journeys. Ultimately, we are all searching for a guiding light to illuminate our path, dispelling the shadows that surround us.\n\nI recall a conversation with my father, who shared with me his fondness for cardinals. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain pelt against the roof, the sound muffled by the tin exterior. The downspouts funneled the rain onto the plants, drowning them in a small, desolate pool. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes a mixture of introspection and reminiscence. His appearance had changed – his hair thinned, his clothes hung loosely from his frame. I sensed a deep sadness emanating from him, and our conversation was tinged with an unspoken awareness that this might be our last moment together. I chose not to confront the impending reality, instead opting to share a moment of quiet companionship with him.\n\nMy father's battle with illness ended just five days after my 22nd birthday in December. The treatments had prolonged his life, but at what cost, I couldn't fathom. I wondered about the nature of a benevolent deity, one that would allow such suffering. That night, I chose not to pray, and instead, I questioned the existence of a higher power that seemed indifferent to my pleas.\n\nI had decided not to witness his passing, unable to bear the thought of watching the person who brought me into this world slip away. I opted to remember my father through the memories of his life, rather than the circumstances of his death. I knew him better than others, and I believed he would have preferred it that way. For three days, I stayed hidden in my bed, waiting for news that would confirm the inevitable.\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.",
            "The Gothic Novel, a genre often perceived as an incongruous blend of the old and the new, was, as Ian Watt astutely observed, 'the epitome of dualities,' where anachronistic elements commingled with modern literary sensibilities. Since its inception, the Gothic genre has been subject to a wide range of reactions, from scathing criticism to effusive praise, with some dismissing it as a shallow exercise in sensationalism, while others extolled its capacity to evoke a sense of 'the terrible sublime' (Burke). The pioneering work, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the rich tapestry of medieval romances and modern novelistic conventions to create a new literary paradigm. By juxtaposing antiquated theatrical elements with the nascent novel's capacity for psychological insight, Walpole initiated a genre that would endure through the ages, paradoxically, both antiquated and innovative in its appeal.\n\nThe Gothic genre's affinity for medieval motifs, derived from theatre, architecture, and tradition, added to its aura of mystique. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term 'Gothic' was employed to describe a range of disparate cultural and artistic movements, often connoting an air of antiquity or rustic simplicity in the face of modernity's triumphant march. The confluence of the theatrical and the novelistic, with its capacity to convey the inner lives of characters, helped to ensure the Gothic genre's longevity, rendering it simultaneously a relic of the past and a fresh, exciting discovery for readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic concepts is the ideal of chivalry, a medieval notion that underwent significant transformations in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry's emphasis on the virtuous knight, epitomized by bravery, honor, and competence, resonated deeply with Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, who lamented the decline of this ideal in his own society. By invoking the chivalric code, Gothic authors created a sanitized, romanticized representation of the past, which would eventually influence the development of Romanticism. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's character Frederic embodies this ideal, as described in the following passage:\n\nFrederic, a prince of noble lineage, has suffered the slings of fate and emerged scarred, his character tempered by adversity. His gallant and courteous demeanor, although exaggerated for effect, introduces the theme of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre. This image of the 'gallant and courteous Knight' prefigures the trope of the overwrought, which would come to characterize the genre.",
            "The logistical orchestration of goods, from initial raw materials to final customer delivery, encompasses the multifaceted processes of supply chain management. This concept, first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, involves strategically planning, implementing, and controlling the entire sequence to meet customer demands efficiently. The six core components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory management, geographical positioning, transportation, and data integration.\n\nEffective supply chain management relies on a thorough understanding of these components. Production forms the foundational stage of the process, where manufacturers outline the production timeline, including the 'when,' 'why,' 'where,' and 'how' of production. To inform these decisions, managers must first analyze market trends and customer preferences. By considering the market's pulse, manufacturers can determine the most sought-after products and quantities to produce. This market-driven approach enables managers to allocate production resources efficiently and maximize customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce the production plan is established, the next step is to decide on the production location and facility, taking into account factors such as volume, quality, and customer demand. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment is also crucial to ensuring a smooth production process. Every detail, no matter how seemingly minor, plays a vital role in the supply chain's success, as inconsistencies can lead to significant losses in time and resources in the long run. For instance, retailers like Wal-Mart and Target employ detailed blueprints and protocols for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, to minimize confusion and ensure seamless execution.\n\nSupply, the second critical element in supply chain management, involves making strategic decisions regarding a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. This may involve identifying the optimal internal divisions for various production processes or deciding to outsource specific tasks to external companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while minimizing costs and maintaining flexibility. By leveraging these strategic choices, companies can optimize their supply chain operations and stay competitive in the market.",
            "In a striking visual statement, Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a sign with a provocative message in her hand in Burma, a Southeast Asian nation currently governed by a military junta that seized power in 1962. The sign, scribbled with a Sharpie, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, officially known as Myanmar, has a complex and tumultuous history marked by periods of authoritarian rule and public protests. In 2007, a wave of street protests, dubbed the Saffron Revolution, swept the country after a decade of relative calm. Led by a large number of Buddhist monks, the protests drew international attention, albeit briefly, before escalating into violence, with reports of military crackdowns and ransacking of monasteries. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed while covering a protest in September 2007. Officially, 13 deaths were reported, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the military, estimated that the true toll was much higher, with thousands of bodies left uncounted.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. The desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain control over their populations is a recurring theme throughout history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority to govern, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people. In modern times, the actions of leaders have been no less concerning. The Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, for instance, saw intellectuals, activists, and students gather in Beijing to demand greater freedoms, resulting in a disputed death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militias and government forces targeted Tutsis and moderates, is another stark example. The Holocaust, during which millions of Jews were systematically persecuted and killed, is a harrowing reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed to a unique combination of his remarkable longevity and compositional prowess. His remarkable ability to cultivate a cohesive ensemble identity lent itself to numerous iconic works that harmoniously integrated the talents of individual band members. While Ellington's piano presence may be understated in certain compositions, his skill as a composer lies in crafting intricate, layered pieces that showcased the distinctive strengths of each musician. By skillfully blending soloistic freedom with tightly woven orchestration, he created a musical landscape where each player could shine, whether through improvisation or carefully calibrated phrasing. This masterful approach enabled Ellington to craft some of the most innovative and groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nThe esteemed Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a melodic instrument, evident in his early work, Creole Love Call. By incorporating vocal elements throughout his career, Ellington successfully added depth and nuance to his compositions without the confines of traditional lyrics. This 12-bar blues piece exemplifies his ability to complement the unique styles of his soloists, which remained a hallmark of his career. The structure of Creole Love Call consists of six distinct choruses:\n\n1. A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, commencing with a smooth, melodic tone that gradually gives way to a more rugged timbre.\n2. A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the core melody, emphasizing elongated notes and subtle nuances.\n3. A soaring clarinet solo, elevated by a syncopated piano accompaniment in a high register.\n4. The full ensemble recreates the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between brass and reed sections.\n5. A climactic finale, as the reeds now initiate the call-and-response, backed by staccato stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the initial structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds; in this final chorus, the vocalist adopts a \"growl\" technique, soloing as a true instrumental voice.\n\nThe piece concludes with a concise tag, featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, striking conclusion courtesy of a trombone.\n\nEllington's strategic incorporation of vocal elements to enhance his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his oeuvre, as seen in his subsequent works. Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, showcases Ellington's deft orchestration and keen ear for tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing masterfully blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, yielding a rich and complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further exemplifying his ability to harness the unique strengths of each musician.",
            "A sense of emptiness had been prevalent in her life for what felt like an eternity. This unfulfilled longing had begun to manifest itself around the age of fourteen, as she navigated the challenges of adolescence. Several years later, at the age of seventeen, this feeling persisted, but her perspective had shifted. She now yearned for human connection rather than mere material possessions. However, her lack of interest in the opposite sex had left her puzzled and introspective. Some individuals had attempted to woo her, but none had sparked her genuine interest. She frequently questioned her own desires, seeking to comprehend the root cause of this unusual phenomenon.\n\nHer home life was generally tranquil, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. They rarely argued with each other, and disagreements with their daughter were infrequent. Their infrequent disagreements revolved around her strong will and independent nature, which often created a delightful contrast to her parents' more reserved personalities. Her unique blend of warmth and kindness made her well-liked by those around her.\n\nOn this particular day, however, the atmosphere was far from peaceful. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was startled by a faint cry of distress coming from the kitchen. Her mother's voice, typically melodious, was now tinged with pain. She rushed into the room, alarm etched on her face, and frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing in agony as she took short, labored breaths. Her daughter hastened to her side, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's arm. \"Ow... sweetheart, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother replied, her words rushed and laced with distress. Her daughter quickly assessed the situation and sprang into action. \"Okay, Mom, where am I picking you up?\" she asked, trying to stay calm. Her mother directed her, and her daughter was grateful for the physical training she had received. With a sense of resolve, she carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and the air of anxiety that accompanied it were palpable, but her daughter's focus remained solely on her mother's well-being. She swiftly escorted her mother into the hospital and alerted the medical staff, who quickly gathered around. A gurney was brought, and her mother was gently placed on it. The doctors and nurses quickly attended to her, while her daughter was left to anxiously wait.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the top shelf.",
            "A large-scale observational study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (Med Diet) and the incidence of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke in women. The study used a modified version of the Med Diet, known as the Alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet, which emphasizes a higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as moderate intake of fish and low consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption was also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have consistently shown an inverse association between adherence to the Med Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. Notably, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated the Med Diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles among obese individuals. However, prior research had not specifically examined the relationship between the Med Diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study drew upon the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term cohort study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The study enrolled 74,886 women aged 38-63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, participants completed six self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to assess their nutrient intake. The FFQs were validated through independent review of medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions were classified as \"probable\" cases due to lack of documentation.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and better capture long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. The analysis controlled for potential confounding factors, including age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. Separate models were used to analyze fatal and non-fatal CHD and stroke events.\n\nThe results showed a significant association between higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed score, and lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2,391 incident CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths were documented. Women with the highest aMed scores exhibited a lower risk of CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "A pivotal moment in American financial history occurred in 2007, when the nation's economic stability began to unravel. The consequences of this crisis remain evident, with unemployment rates on the rise and several prominent corporations struggling to recover. It is essential to examine the underlying causes of this economic downturn and explore potential solutions to prevent future catastrophes.\n\nA critical examination of the events leading up to the crisis reveals a pattern of poor decision-making and inadequate regulatory oversight. Financial institutions, under pressure from both government policies and investors, extended large sums of credit to borrowers who lacked the means to repay. This reckless lending strategy, coupled with an inadequate financial infrastructure, created a perfect storm that eventually collapsed. The proliferation of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and other complex financial instruments only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nHistorical records indicate that the seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, when the Clinton administration relaxed lending standards in an effort to boost public support. Fannie Mae, a leading provider of mortgage financing, was under pressure to expand its lending activities and maintain its growth trajectory. A 1999 article by Steven Holmes of the New York Times noted that Fannie Mae was driven to increase its mortgage lending among low-income borrowers, despite concerns about the potential risks. Holmes astutely predicted that such actions could lead to a government bailout, similar to the one implemented in the 1980s for the savings and loan industry.\n\nThe crisis was further fueled by the widespread adoption of complex financial products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These instruments allowed households and financial institutions to take on excessive risk, leaving them vulnerable to even minor market fluctuations. The consequences were catastrophic, as the housing market bubble burst, and financial institutions were left reeling. The top U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. In the aftermath, several major financial institutions were forced to restructure or face intense regulatory scrutiny, while Fannie and Freddie were placed under government control, with a combined mortgage debt of $5 trillion.",
            "The dreaded exposition. A narrative device that can either elevate your writing to new heights or induce a collective yawn from your readers. Dr. Thompson has been known to mutter under her breath when faced with a lengthy passage of backstory, the words \"Show, don't tell\" echoing in her mind.\n\nWhile the adage is well-worn, Dr. Thompson still finds herself slipping into the trap of excessive narration. It's as if the critic within her voice whispers, \"Get the groundwork out of the way, get to the good stuff.\" This inner dialogue is not to be confused with the more persuasive voice urging her to reveal the intricacies of each character's past.\n\nExposition, in essence, is the act of telling rather than showing. It's the cinematic equivalent of a character dumping a wealth of information on another character, à la a filmic rendition of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, the author takes on this role.\n\nConsider a common scenario: a heroine meets her love interest at a specific time and place, they exchange vows in a grand ceremony, and tragically, he meets a violent end. One wouldn't expect this sequence to occupy an extended period, during which the husband and wife barely exchange a few lines of dialogue. A more effective approach would be to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his devotion through his words and actions. Similarly, the heroine's transformation in the wake of his loss should be palpable, conveyed through her thoughts, behaviors, and interactions. This nuanced portrayal would allow readers to form an emotional connection with the couple and the heroine, ultimately making her grief more relatable and impactful.\n\nIn other words, a compelling narrative requires more than just the skeletal framework of \"They met, they married, he died.\" It demands the meat that brings the story to life.\n\nAs a writer, one must resist the temptation to rush past key details, such as a character's background. Take, for instance, a character who has a rich history – serving in the military, working as a night manager at a gas station, having been married twice, and harboring dreams of entrepreneurship. A brief summary of these facts might seem convenient, but it would only serve to leave readers with a vague impression. A more effective approach would be to seamlessly integrate these details into the narrative, allowing the character to emerge as a fully fleshed-out individual.",
            "I recently watched multiple broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first live segment caught my attention, which was a story about a violent incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was arrested for allegedly stabbing his wife, although her name was not disclosed. The news team presented his mug shot, which was striking. Despite its developing nature, the story received around two minutes of coverage. I believe this was a reasonable allocation of time.\n\nThe second report focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, where an 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, was critically injured. At the time, there were no suspects or arrests. The SWAT team was involved in the investigation. I noticed a relatively brief coverage, which might have been due to the fact that the incident occurred in a predominantly minority neighborhood. I have observed a pattern, which suggests that minority victims often receive less media attention than those from other backgrounds. This disparity in coverage is a concern I have been aware of for some time.\n\nThe subsequent story highlighted a gunshot wound discovered on a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided information about the suspected location and circumstances of the incident. Authorities believe a .22 caliber rifle was used, firing a bullet that hit the aircraft. A $5,000 reward was announced for tips that lead to the identification of the shooter.\n\nThe next segment addressed a weather forecast for the upcoming weekend, predicting rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to range from the mid to low eighties. This story was likely included as a \"preview\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAnother report focused on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie and standing at around six feet tall and 150 pounds. The news team emphasized his racial characteristics, which seemed unusual.\n\nFinally, a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual from Texas, was presented. He had been involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation, conspiring to distribute the substance from Texas to Ohio. I found it intriguing that instead of stating his prison sentence as 25 years, the news team mentioned \"300 months.\" It's unclear whether this was intended to convey a harsher punishment or not. Additionally, the mention of his Hispanic heritage seemed unnecessary.",
            "An intriguing aspect of human relationships is the profound connection that exists between siblings, particularly brothers. This bond is multifaceted and can encompass a range of complex emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and the capacity for cruelty. Brothers often possess an uncanny understanding of one another, which can be attributed to their unique bond. In times of crisis, the true nature of this connection is revealed, often showcasing both positive and negative traits. When these emotions become apparent, they can have far-reaching consequences.\n\nOne notable literary work, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" explores this theme in depth. Set against the backdrop of a vibrant and detailed landscape, the narrative follows two brothers as they embark on a perilous journey. The story reaches its climax as bitter disappointment and intense pride collide, resulting in a tragic outcome where only one brother survives. The author masterfully conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his brother through direct characterization and the narrator's perspective.\n\nThe protagonist's actions throughout the story can be largely attributed to his fixation on a single emotion: pride. From their initial outings to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had envisioned having a partner with whom he could share his interests and skills, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's physical limitations, a result of his weak heart, made these aspirations unattainable. The protagonist's disappointment and frustration are palpable, and he even grapples with the idea of suffocating his brother, a notion that raises questions about the depths of his emotions. Nevertheless, the brother's simple smile brings a glimmer of hope, revealing a more nuanced aspect of the protagonist's character.",
            "The cerebral cortex is a multifaceted, adaptive information-processing apparatus. As technological advancements unfold, the analogies employed to describe its functioning have undergone significant evolution. Initially, the brain was likened to a parchment, then to a scroll, and subsequently to a codex. Presently, the computer analogy has gained widespread acceptance. It's essential to acknowledge that these metaphors, although useful, have limitations and can lead to misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing commences with the reception of sensory data from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli, such as tactile sensations, thermal cues, acoustic waves, or photons, into electrochemical impulses. The processed sensory information undergoes iterative transformations through a combination of bottom-up and top-down processing mechanisms. For instance, when perceiving an image of a black square on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles fundamental components like color, orientation, and spatial boundaries – where color transitions significantly over a short distance – to infer the presence of a rectangular object. Top-down processing employs the decisions generated at intermediate stages of the bottom-up process to expedite recognition of the object. Top-down processing in this example might facilitate the identification of the object as a black square rather than a square-shaped recess in the white background.\n\nUpon achieving a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines the signal's priority and allocates access to relevant cognitive processes. For example, although the brain processes every individual blade of grass when gazing downwards, a healthy attention filter prevents conscious awareness of these details. Conversely, you might readily identify your name even in a noisy environment. There are numerous stages of processing, and the outcomes are modulated by attention at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first be stored within its internal frameworks. Various types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods tailored to specific types of sensory stimuli. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic characteristics, or semantic meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained through a series of mechanisms. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on a transient electrical signal propagated through a sequence of neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained through the structural organization of certain types of proteins.\n\nSeveral models have been proposed to describe the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing from various disciplines such as human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits the existence of nodes representing concepts, which are interconnected based on their semantic relationships. For example, in a semantic network, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In his dystopian novel, Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a scathing critique of the emerging technocratic and capitalist systems of his time. The novel's citizens are conditioned to prioritize collective well-being over individuality, with their desires manipulated by the ruling World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, the work can be seen as a commentary on the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the exploitation of the masses. The novel's use of terms such as homogeny and reification suggests that Huxley was concerned about the homogenization of society and the reduction of people to mere commodities.\n\nThe novel also satirizes capitalism by illustrating the concept of false consciousness, where the working class is kept ignorant of their true relationship to the ruling elite. The conditioning of the population through hypnopædia ensures that they are driven by a desire for consumption and indulgence, rather than critical thinking or independent decision-making. This is a classic example of ideological control, where the ruling class maintains its power by manipulating the perceptions and desires of the masses.\n\nThe social hierarchy in Brave New World is also a clear illustration of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over the rest of society. The lower classes are unaware of their oppression, while the upper classes are complicit in their own subjugation. This is evident in the interactions between characters, which are superficial and lacking in depth. The novel suggests that the pursuit of material wealth and status has eroded the capacity for genuine human connection and emotion, leaving individuals feeling isolated and disconnected.\n\nFurthermore, the novel's portrayal of relationships between characters highlights the effects of capitalism on human relationships. The emphasis on physical appearance and superficial interactions is a commentary on the ways in which capitalism reduces people to commodities and objects of desire. The complacency of the lower classes in their assigned roles within the social hierarchy is also a reflection of Marxist ideas about the proletariat, who are manipulated into believing they are superior to others as long as they conform to societal expectations and continue to consume and obey.\n\nBy examining Brave New World through a Marxist framework, it becomes clear that Huxley was warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the exploitation of the masses by capitalist systems. His novel remains a powerful commentary on the consequences of a society that prioritizes material wealth and status over individual freedom and human connection.",
            "I've been a part of the University Park community for a little over two and a half years now. One of the challenges many of us face is navigating the campus. During my first year, I was housed in an East Halls dorm, situated at the eastern edge of campus. Commuting from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, situated near the heart of campus, often took around 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. A conversation with an alumnus roughly my age shed light on the campus's past development. In the not-so-distant past, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by a significant expanse of undeveloped land. This vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new facilities like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly complicated. To effectively address the issue, I believe the bicycle offers a viable solution. However, owning a bike is merely the first step – students must also take advantage of it, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with cyclists' needs in mind.\n\nDiscussing the benefits of cycling with a friend who resumed riding after a hiatus highlighted its appeal. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. After a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise, one can cover significant distances. Given that I reside off-campus, about the same distance from the campus center as some dorms, acquiring a bike has been one of the best decisions I've made. Daily classes in the Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, can now be reached in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a decent pace. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, presents some challenges, regardless of the mode of transportation. In my opinion, cycling is the most suitable option, considering my busy schedule. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation, which would not only be time-consuming but also impractical given my daily commitments. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, translating to over two and a half hours per week. When factoring in other walking time for classes, appointments, and other activities, this becomes unsustainable."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",

Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind.

Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day!

            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Through my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to forge a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a meaningful impact on the lives of vulnerable children who have experienced abuse or neglect, as well as provide essential support to troubled families. The guiding principles I plan to uphold in this field include: a commitment to service, respect for individuals and their unique experiences, a strong sense of ethics, and a dedication to fostering positive relationships and personal growth. These core values not only resonate deeply with the social work profession, but are also essential to my own personal growth and development.\n\nPrior to discovering my passion for social work, I grappled with defining my career path. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed individuals struggling to cope with challenges, often relying on unhealthy mechanisms to escape their problems. This exposure led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, yet I still felt uncertain about my long-term career goals. Following my graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to explore my options. It was during this time that I had a pivotal experience that altered my perspective. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was facing a difficult home life. His story touched my heart, and I felt compelled to help. I reached out to the authorities, leveraging my recent graduation in Psychology to facilitate a conversation with the boy's parents. Their dismissive responses and lack of accountability for their actions sparked a realization within me: the need for compassionate, informed support systems in situations like these. This experience solidified my interest in social work, driving me to pursue a career that would enable me to support children and families in crisis.\n\nAnother essential value in the field of social work is social justice. Our society often extols the importance of individuality, yet frequently restricts self-expression and conformity. This paradoxical dynamic has long fascinated me, and I believe that social work offers a unique opportunity to challenge these norms. Throughout my educational journey, I have actively advocated for social justice, embracing individuality and self-expression in my own life. From expressing my personal style through unconventional fashion choices to participating in social justice movements, I have consistently sought to challenge societal expectations and promote inclusivity.",
            "The following dissertation undertakes an in-depth examination of the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in relation to the complex phenomenon of insomnia. The biological paradigm centres around the genetic and physiological determinants of sleep disturbances, while the sociocultural model delves into the environmental and demographic influences that shape our understanding of sleep patterns. This comprehensive review synthesizes existing research to elucidate the intricacies of both models, highlighting key findings and evaluating their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorised into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders comorbid with mental health conditions, or sleep disorders precipitated by medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssonmias, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other related conditions, which are characterised by disturbances in sleep initiation, maintenance, or duration. Conversely, Parasomnias are sleep disorders manifesting as behavioural or physiological abnormalities, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models, with a particular emphasis on the primary sleep disorders.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders posits that genetic and heritable factors, as well as physiological mechanisms, contribute to sleep disturbances. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles. A study employing mice as a model found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for modulating sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, whereas inhibition of this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and enhanced sleep. The administration of the GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This research suggests that animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, revealing a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor may compromise an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are far-reaching, as the inheritance of the phenotype could regulate sleep patterns, and any alterations to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, ultimately affecting various aspects of daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks.",
            "The complexities of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) are multifaceted, encompassing three distinct areas of examination. Initially, a concise overview of this condition is provided, followed by an in-depth exploration of diagnosis, including key indicators or 'red flags.' The paper concludes with practical suggestions for educators in mainstreamed classrooms to support students affected by CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to process auditory information. This entails the efficacious utilization of auditory cues by the central nervous system (CNS), which is responsible for processing and interpreting sound. In essence, individuals afflicted with CAPD can hear sounds within the normal range, yet their brain struggles to decipher and separate distinct auditory inputs, such as speech from background noise (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Consequently, the brain's auditory processing centers fail to function as intended, hindering the ability to comprehend and analyze auditory information.\n\nHistorically, CAPD has been recognized since the mid-1950s under the term 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers during this period, including the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing assessments for children with communication disorders in 1954. Subsequently, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception in 1961 (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The 1977 national conference further catalyzed research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, the ability to distinguish between multiple auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may experience challenges in filtering out background noises, synthesizing sound patterns, and determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre). Moreover, they may struggle to recognize subtle differences in speech, such as detecting sarcasm through changes in tone.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted, encompassing systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists utilize a range of assessments to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally reliable diagnostic tool or test, and the underlying causes of CAPD remain unknown. Diagnostic approaches often involve presenting patients with multiple auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the concept of deception is portrayed as a double-edged sword, capable of both facilitating deception and ultimately leading to self-discovery.  On one hand, adopting a disguise can be a means to achieve temporary protection or gain, as exemplified by Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man. This ruse allows her to survive in a foreign land and secure her safety. However, this disguise also leads to the alienation of her support system, particularly her female peers, thereby rendering her isolated in a setting where she is in need of solace.\n\nFurthermore, Viola's successful impersonation as a man creates a complex situation, where she inadvertently incites romantic feelings in both Olivia and Orsino. Olivia's infatuation with Cesario, Viola's disguise, raises questions about the nature of her true desires, with some speculating that her affections may be rooted in societal expectations rather than genuine attraction. Conversely, Orsino's suppressed emotions towards women are laid bare through his interactions with Cesario, a dynamic that may be seen as a progressive exploration of repressed desires.\n\nThe portrayal of deception in Twelfth Night highlights the intricate relationship between identities, relationships, and deception. By exploring the complexities of disguise, Shakespeare raises fundamental questions about the human need for self-preservation versus the preservation of social bonds. In the end, the play suggests that deception can be a catalyst for self-discovery, but it also underscores the importance of authenticity in our interactions with others.\n\nIn this sense, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on the fluidity of identity and the complexities of human relationships. The play's exploration of deception as a tool for self-discovery challenges the audience to consider the consequences of adopting a false persona and the repercussions on one's relationships and sense of self.",
            "The German colonial administration has been characterized by several notable aspects, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, the colonial empire's multifaceted nature, encompassing diverse policies and governance styles, defies a simplistic characterization. The provision of education across the colonies displayed a similar degree of diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a sizable population of educated and literate Africans, a testament to the effectiveness of German educational initiatives in certain regions. Conversely, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary observers for their quality.\n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a striking disparity. Unlike in East Africa, where the colonial government actively invested in the establishment of state schools and played a significant role in the education of the native population, in South West Africa the responsibility for native education fell largely to missionary organizations that received limited official support. Nevertheless, the government did allocate significant resources towards the education of European settlers in the colony, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation to missionary institutions. The long-term consequences of these educational policies in South West Africa were far-reaching, persisting even after the conclusion of German rule. In contrast, other German colonies boasted a notable number of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. A combination of social, economic, and political factors contributed to this divergent experience, warranting further investigation.\n\nExisting research on education in the German colonial empire is extensive and has been conducted by scholars from a range of backgrounds. The majority of these studies were written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule, with a primary focus on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the scope of inquiry through comparative analyses of education in different German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems of distinct colonies. One of the most notable works is Cohen's comparative study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which sheds light on the factors contributing to the differences between the two colonies. Cohen attributes many of the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to its relatively large settler population.\n\nIn contrast to other German colonies, South West Africa presented a moderately temperate climate, despite being largely dominated by arid desert terrain. The European population in South West Africa capitalized on these relatively favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 settlers residing in the colony by 1913. This figure surpassed the settler population in the colony with the next largest number of European residents, East Africa, which boasted approximately 5,336 settlers at the same time.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has been marked by an explosion of diverse genres, making it increasingly challenging to catalog them comprehensively. Furthermore, many of these genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into numerous sub-genres, further complicating the classification process. One of the most dynamic and expressive genres to emerge in recent decades is heavy metal, which has undergone an extraordinary transformation in the past 40 years.\n\nCharacterized by its emotional depth, heavy metal music tends to explore the darker aspects of the human experience, often with a sense of raw intensity. This genre's versatility has been its hallmark, as artists have continually pushed the boundaries of what is possible, giving rise to an astonishing array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. As a result, the heavy metal movement has become increasingly fragmented, with numerous niches and styles emerging, making it difficult to define its core essence.\n\nTo grasp the complexities of modern metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the factors that have shaped it. Metal is, at its core, a genre that embodies the counterculture ethos of the late 1960s and 1970s, marked by a rejection of mainstream values and a quest for creative freedom. The influence of psychedelic substances during this era contributed to a shift towards more experimental and avant-garde sounds, as artists sought to push the limits of their art. This experimentation led to the development of metal's distinctive sonic characteristics, including its emphasis on volume, intensity, and theatricality.\n\nThe genre's affinity for the darker aspects of human experience has been fueled by its ability to tap into the Romantic Era's fascination with the sublime and the unknown. This is evident in the lyrics of many metal songs, which often explore themes of mortality, existential crises, and the human condition. The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" for example, is often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, and its lyrics reflect the darker, more intense atmosphere that characterized the genre's early days.",
            "A remarkable French artist, Henri Rousseau, predated the surrealist movement by several decades, yet his own artistic explorations of the subconscious were already taking shape in the early 20th century. His 1910 masterpiece, 'The Dream', serves as a poignant reflection of the artist's own aspirations and internal conflicts. Confronted with the daunting task of gaining recognition from the art community, Rousseau found himself torn between the desire for creative autonomy and the pressure to conform to established styles. This dichotomy is perhaps the most prominent theme in 'The Dream', a painting that encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle to reconcile his unique artistic vision with the expectations of the art world.\n\nTo understand the significance of 'The Dream', it is essential to delve into Rousseau's personal history. Born in Laval, a small town in northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau was born into a family with a modest background. His father was a successful tinsmith and hardware merchant, and Rousseau's upbringing was marked by a relatively comfortable upbringing. Despite a lack of formal artistic training, Rousseau began his working life at a young age, eventually finding employment with the French municipal toll service. His role as a gabelou, or toll collector, would later be rebranded as a douanier, or customs inspector, a moniker that would become synonymous with his artistic persona.\n\nThe loss of his first wife, Clémence, who died alongside eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one daughter, Julia, and a profound sense of grief. As a means of coping with his emotional pain, Rousseau turned to painting, seeking solace in the creative process. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's artwork was rooted in his own experiences and the realities of everyday life. His desire for recognition and acceptance from the art world is all the more understandable given his late start in life and the presence of more established artists, such as Matisse, who was gaining recognition during the same period.\n\nJan Gordon, author of Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse and Rousseau were technically competitors in the art world, they differed fundamentally in their approaches and motivations. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to create works that were so conventional that they would earn him a place within the Artiste Français circle.",
            "In the realm of human understanding, a profound interplay exists between the realms of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. This intricate connection has long been acknowledged by some of the most discerning minds, including John Keats, who, in his celebrated \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" poignantly captures the essence of this relationship, stating, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While education and experience shape our comprehension of the world, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics often transcends these conventional bounds, echoing Keats' words.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics aim to elucidate rather than dictate, striving to explain the underlying qualities that render a work of art or literature beautiful or an action morally sound, rather than prescribing a set of rigid guidelines. A closer examination of art and morality reveals that our interpretations often meander around the periphery, discussing aspects like composition, cultural context, or historical significance, yet somehow fall short of capturing the quintessence of what makes something truly remarkable. When discussing a favorite work, it's common to hear a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth analysis. This phenomenon suggests that both art and morality possess an intrinsic quality that cannot be fully encapsulated by description.\n\nAs Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" This notion resonates with the notion that ethics, too, has a transcendent quality that defies complete articulation. Ludwig Wittgenstein's assertion, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental,\" underscores the elusive nature of ethics. I propose that this enigmatic aspect is, in fact, the most potent characteristic of both ethics and aesthetics, serving as a unifying thread between the two.\n\nThis profound connection is particularly evident in literature, where the intersection of art and morality is most pronounced. As McKean astutely notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" While moral standards may be less relevant in other art forms, such as music, they seem to be an intrinsic aspect of literature, speaking to the very fabric of human existence. As McKean further remarks, \"Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern identity is marked by a unique blend of cultural influences, spanning from the Alpine foothills of southern Germany to the Baltic coast in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is woven together across various cities, including München, Köln, and Dresden, each with its distinct character shaped by its geographical location. Despite its contemporary unity, Germany's rich cultural heritage stems from a diverse array of historical sources and tribal influences.\n\nThe origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians offering various explanations. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested that the name might be derived from the Tungrian tribe, which was known to the Romans as \"Germans\" prior to their crossing of the Rhine River and their conflict with Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98 AD). In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germanic tribes that remained beyond the Rhine. Caesar's use of the term was likely inspired by the Gauls themselves, who may have referred to their Germanic neighbors by this name. In his account of the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes that the Germans, who lived beyond the Rhine, were engaged in almost daily battles with the Gauls (Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nAlternative etymologies propose that the term \"German\" might be connected to the spear, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which could imply that the Germans were known for their loud or boisterous nature. \n\nTacitus' work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in 98 AD, provides valuable insights into the early history of the Germanic peoples. In this treatise, Tacitus describes the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences through immigration or cultural exchange. He notes that those who would venture to Germany would have been drawn by its harsh climate, rugged terrain, and unique cultural landscape. While the Romans did engage in military campaigns in Germania, they generally did not settle there permanently, preferring to maintain a presence on the periphery of the Roman Empire. Instead, the Germanic tribes interacted with the Romans through trade and by serving in the Roman military, bringing their skills and goods to the Roman world (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "As I gazed down, my mind temporarily blanketed itself against the visual stimuli before me. I observed without emotional attachment or speculation, adopting an almost detached awareness of the scene unfolding before my eyes. My thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness at a pace that left little room for reflection. In this state, I seemed to exist solely as a conduit for the sensory information I was processing.\n\nI had long been fascinated with the idea of creating visual representations of the world, a curiosity that began when I was six years old. The discovery of 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' by an artist I had the opportunity to work with reignited this passion. This book delves into the fundamental principles of drawing, from understanding the basic tools to processing visual information. One technique that particularly resonated with me was the exercise of framing a subject with a square boundary, allowing the complex to be distilled into its most essential elements.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I was overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of the visual data. I failed to mentally impose the artist's frame, and my mind was flooded with the intricate details of the scene. I stood transfixed, my thoughts in a state of suspended animation.\n\nAs I reflect on the artistic process, I am reminded of the unique styles of masters like Picasso, Monet, and the Italian Renaissance artists. If I were to consider myself an artist, I would view this moment as the inception of my creative journey, the beginning of my artistic odyssey, titled 'Work in Brown'.\n\nI tentatively reached for my chosen medium, my hand instinctively guiding it through the air. My muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand connected with the object, giving shape and form to my creative expression. Water, serene and smooth, seemed to flow through my thoughts, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me. But then, my hand jerked back, and I found myself violently gripping the toilet handle once more. The stubborn brown package refused to budge, stuck fast like a slug on the toilet's surface.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, my feet shoulder-width apart, I frowned in distaste as I gazed at the unappealing remnants of human waste left behind for the janitorial staff to clean up. The need for a solution was clear, and with a few more deliberate movements, I managed to dislodge the offending item. With the crisis averted, I turned my attention to the wall to my right and grasped the sheet of toilet paper, began to unravel it, and eventually formed it into a makeshift mitt. Standing up straight, I then bent at the waist, and my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, much like a mother carefully placing a turkey into the oven on Thanksgiving Day.",
            "The alarming trend of youthful fatalities behind the wheel is a pressing concern in the United States. A multifaceted analysis reveals that a combination of factors contributes to this daunting statistic. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that the adolescent brain is not yet fully equipped to handle the complexities of driving, underscoring the significance of inexperience in this context. Novice drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents, as well as vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a noteworthy correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. It is a well-documented phenomenon that teenagers often engage in peer-driven activities, which only exacerbates the situation.\n\nTo address this issue, several states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit underage passengers. However, this measure is merely a temporary solution, as the root problem lies in the inherent limitations of young drivers. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that the desire for risk-taking among adolescents, particularly those under the age of 20, is a significant factor in the high accident rate. This propensity for thrill-seeking makes it prudent to delay the issuance of full driver's licenses until this tendency has diminished.\n\nIf we continue to grant licenses to young teens, we can expect a significant increase in fatalities. With the Baby Boomer generation's offspring approaching driving age, the number of new teen drivers will surge, potentially leading to a staggering death toll in the coming years.\n\nLegislative action on this matter would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education courses as a precursor to obtaining a full license, while restricting access to motor vehicles for those under 18. A provisional permit could still be issued, accompanied by a set number of practical driving hours, which could be based on existing state requirements (e.g., California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice).\n\nGiven the nationwide scope of the issue, uniform federal legislation would be a logical and effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country. This proposal is not a novel concept, but rather a much-needed step towards mitigating the risks associated with teenage driving.",
            "During an investigation of the early cinematic archive at the Library of Congress, I opted to analyze the collection of trick films produced by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. A total of fifteen films were examined, showcasing the creative use of editing techniques to craft illusions. My research primarily focused on dissecting the aesthetic principles governing trick films and identifying the anomalies evident in several later productions. Notably, these early trick films were largely confined to a static setting with a frontal presentation, adhering to a strict convention of stationary camera shots and adhering to a one-to-one shot ratio. However, a few pioneering films at the turn of the century deviated from these conventions, introducing novel elements such as multiple shot compositions.\n\nOne common thread among the trick films was their filming within a contained, proscenium-framed set. The camera remained fixed in its position, refraining from panning or following subjects. This visual approach drew inspiration from theatre and vaudeville traditions, as well as the aesthetics of magic performances. One limitation inherent in this format was that characters generally moved horizontally, never approaching or receding from the camera. A prime example can be seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right side and traverse the stage, occasionally disappearing from view without the camera tracking their movement.\n\nThe proscenium-style composition also resulted in predominantly long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were entirely absent from the Edison catalog of trick films, echoing the conventions of live theatre and vaudeville, where the entire performance was presented within a framed space. As a result, characters rarely moved towards the camera, precluding the use of close-ups. The majority of trick films conformed to a pattern of one conceptual shot equating to one physical shot, which imposed a time constraint of approximately one minute or less, contingent on the frame rate. This linear narrative structure often confined trick films to short, vaudeville-inspired tricks, such as illusions, disappearances, and quick-change sequences with minimal storytelling. Notably, however, this apparent unity often belies a more complex construction, where a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple physical shots combined to create an illusion. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, exemplifies this technique, where a closer examination reveals the onset of the physical shot depicting Mary's beheaded body, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the principles of Republicanism, which guided his views on governance and individual freedom. As an agriculturalist, he forged a unique perspective that blended his profession's emphasis on self-sufficiency with his limited experience in politics. This distinct blend of outlooks earned him a reputation as a steadfast champion of personal liberties and a vocal critic of government overreach.\n\nTaylor's agrarian ideals served as the foundation for his opinions on state sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary. He believed that a well-structured agrarian society was the key to a harmonious and thriving community, and that this ideal should be the guiding force behind government policy.\n\nThe notion that the United States had a clean slate, untainted by existing power structures, presented a remarkable opportunity to establish a truly self-governing system. Taylor firmly believed in the inherent value of natural rights, which he saw as interconnected and mutually dependent. He argued that the erosion of one right would imperil the entire system, thereby diminishing the worth of those remaining. Consequently, these rights should remain beyond the reach of government intervention.\n\nIn his vision for an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must balance the innate duality of human nature – encompassing both goodness and malevolence. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to conclude that governments, like their constituents, are inherently flawed. He famously observed, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., p. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agricultural prosperity, and harness the power of capitalism for the greater good. Conversely, a government founded on such principles would operate equitably, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration.\n\nTaylor's stance on self-interest was nuanced: while it was a fundamental driver of human action, it became pernicious only when it led to the exploitation of others. A responsible government, he believed, must acknowledge and manage the darker aspects of human nature to prevent the introduction of pernicious principles.\n\nSimilar to many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, one that limited the federal government's authority to the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be costly and prone to despotism, yet he cautioned that a literal interpretation devoid of context could prove equally hazardous. Moreover, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more eloquently articulated the nation's status as a confederation of sovereign states.",
            "Upon examining the data presented in Figure 17, a notable decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project is evident. This trend may be attributed to several factors. The onset of winter at a New England institution likely resulted in a reduction in biking and walking commutes. Furthermore, the conclusion of the fall semester, coupled with the subsequent holiday season, may have diverted individuals' attention away from the project. The typical December break also presents a challenge, as students and faculty often take time off during this period, potentially reducing the need for campus visits. Following the winter break, the resumption of classes in late January might have contributed to a brief uptick in activity. However, the relatively low number of submissions in February remains a puzzle. It is also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, a phenomenon that can be mitigated through targeted initiatives. \n\nTo counteract this decline, the Carpool Challenge Week campaign was implemented in March, yielding a significant increase in log submissions for that month. This experience highlights the importance of maintaining momentum and addressing the unique challenges posed by academic breaks. Additionally, the project's reliance on alternative modes of transportation is hindered by cultural preferences for personal transportation. To overcome this obstacle, incentives such as gift certificates to local businesses were provided. While these proved effective, it would be intriguing to explore the impact of more substantial prizes, including eco-friendly vehicles, on participation levels. Adjusting the value and variety of incentives throughout the project's duration may have helped sustain engagement and prevent the observed dip in activity. For instance, announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, during the winter break or at the beginning of the spring semester, could have potentially boosted participation and enthusiasm.",
            "The investment landscape is home to a variety of financial instruments, among which exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a unique blend of characteristics. By tracking an index, commodity, or a curated basket of assets, ETFs strike a balance between the diversification of index funds and the flexibility of individual stock ownership. This hybrid model allows for the benefits of short selling, margin buying, and the purchase of minimal shares in any transaction, often at a lower expense ratio compared to the average mutual fund. However, investors should be aware that ETF trading incurs commission fees, similar to those associated with stock transactions. Moreover, the availability of numerous ETF options can be a double-edged sword, as it may lead to information overload and decision paralysis.\n\nIn this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF and scrutinize its top 10 holdings, which collectively comprise 63.58% of the fund's assets. By examining the constituent stocks, we can assess whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. Additionally, we will investigate whether a tailored configuration of these stocks could potentially yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we will concentrate on the top 10 holdings, which account for a significant proportion of the ETF's assets. By normalizing the current percentage of assets to 100%, we can estimate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming the portfolio is comprised entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The accompanying chart provides the calculated values for beta and return.\n\nA cursory examination of the data reveals that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a return approximately 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Conversely, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer a more advantageous risk-return profile. Nevertheless, it is crucial to verify whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of these findings, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF. This will enable us to assess whether the accumulated volatility of the top 10 holdings is meaningfully different from that of the ETF.",
            "In a notable work, Poe has demonstrated mastery of the poetic craft. His poem \"Dream-Land\" showcases his ability to weave together disparate elements in a rich tapestry of sound and symbolism. Notably, in lines 6 and 56, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference that can be traced back to the Roman poet Virgil. However, a more nuanced understanding of this allusion is warranted. While Virgil's use of the term is well-documented, it is also indebted to a more recent literary influence. Poe's fascination with German literature is well-documented, and his exposure to the works of Goethe would have been a significant factor in shaping his writing.\n\nA key aspect of Poe's relationship with Goethe is highlighted by the similarity between their respective poems. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" observes that Poe's work exhibits a clear debt to Goethe's style. This observation is reinforced by the fact that Goethe's magnum opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" was widely disseminated in the early 19th century. The second part of this work, published in 1832, contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, following the death of his wife, succumbs to despair and ultimately takes his own life.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the speaker of \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Both characters are haunted by loss and driven to the brink of madness by their circumstances. The King's descent into darkness and despair serves as a poignant commentary on the human condition, one that Poe likely drew upon in his own work. The fact that both poems share a similar thematic preoccupation with the abyss of human suffering suggests a deep engagement with Goethe's ideas.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" serves as a testament to the interconnectedness of his oeuvre. In both poems, the term functions as a bookend, framing the speaker's journey into the unknown. The landscape of Thulé, with its dark and lonely expanse, serves as a bleak counterpoint to the vibrant world of the speaker's imagination. This dichotomy is echoed in \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's descent into madness is precipitated by his loss and isolation.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is also evident in his admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe's respect for Tennyson, a fellow poet of great renown, would have likely exposed him to Goethe's work. Furthermore, the widespread dissemination of Goethe's writings in the early 19th century would have ensured that his ideas and themes were widely available to poets like Poe.",
            "A shopper who tripped and fell on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store might potentially be awarded punitive damages if the store manager's actions were deemed reckless and intentional, given that he was informed twice of the spill but failed to clean it up for a half-hour because he was taking a break to eat dinner.\n\nA court is unlikely to entirely dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To be eligible for punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result, as well as show that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer will likely argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had already slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident. Furthermore, despite this knowledge, he still failed to take action to address the spill. Palmer's assertion that Martin's actions were reprehensible might not be as persuasive, but it is still a valid argument, considering the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, alerted his manager, Paul Martin, to an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on a break and unable to address the issue at that time. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, but he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California Civil Code Section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it involves a conscious disregard of a plaintiff's rights when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.

            "My interest in Islam was initially sparked by a college course I took about four years ago at the CBC.  The class engaged in a lively discussion about the nature of Islam, with some students questioning whether it's inherently a hostile religion.  As I reflect on the intervening years, I've observed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam in the United States, moving from a predominantly negative to a more tolerant perspective.  This transformation is particularly striking when considering the candidacy of Barack Obama, whose family background includes Muslim heritage, and who rose to prominence in the early 2000s.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad is a subject that fascinates me.  Learning more about his biography has led me to reevaluate my initial understanding of his character.  I was under the impression that Muhammad was a figure who coerced conversions and expanded his influence through conquest.  However, the biography paints a different picture – one of a humble individual who embodied a sense of self-awareness and compassion.  According to the narrative, people were drawn to his teachings as they came to appreciate his message and character.\n\nInterestingly, I've noticed parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying food to feed a group of men.  This style of storytelling may suggest that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble figure who didn't need to prove himself, but rather allowed his message and actions to speak for themselves.  I find this approach problematic, as it downplays the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThe biography also includes anecdotes that appear to serve as testimony to the validity of Muhammad's message.  These accounts often originate from secondary sources, making it challenging to verify their accuracy.  While the intention behind these stories may have been to provide evidence, I felt they diminished the authenticity of the narrative and made it harder to discern fact from fiction.\n\nWhat I find most unsettling about this work is its attempt to depict Muhammad as an exemplary figure, emphasizing his humility, kindness, and wisdom.  However, historical records raise questions about the accuracy of this portrayal.  I'm left wondering whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A thread of divergence can be observed in the Christian narrative as it evolved beyond the life of Jesus.  If we examine the trajectory of Christian thought, we notice a gradual drift from its foundational roots.  The trajectory suggests an increasing awareness of history and a growing inclination towards progressive ideas.  While traditionalists remain steadfast in their convictions, their influence may not be sufficient to sway the broader movement.  As the years unfold, a heightened awareness of historical context is likely to emerge.  There will be a growing desire to distinguish between the accumulated doctrines of Christianity and the original intent of its namesake.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  the trend in Christian history will reverse, leading to a return to the original form.  A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of dogma, much like a reversal of time, until only the essence of Jesus' teachings remains.  As this shift gains traction in the United States and Europe, it will spread, influencing the masses to adopt a more authentic, Jesus-centric approach to faith.  The institutional church will continue to play a guiding role, but the theological landscape will undergo a significant transformation.  The proliferation of diversity within Christendom will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  Regional and denominational differences will diminish, replaced by a growing sense of shared understanding.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the Roman Empire's transition from persecution to Christian dominance, and the transformation of the United States from a society that enslaved to one that empowered African Americans.  A similar reversal is imminent in the Christian faith, one that will seek to reclaim the origins of the religion and reduce diversity in the process.  A key factor in this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal.  If we look back in time, we find the theological underpinnings of Christianity rooted in Judaism.  By the time the Romans seized control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish faith had already developed a strong foundation, centered on monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  The Jewish population was not homogeneous, with various sects like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people each holding distinct beliefs and practices.",
            "One of the underlying themes in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle is the inherent self-interest and callousness of individuals when it comes to the well-being of others. This is exemplified by the factory owners and managers who prioritize their own success and the growth of their businesses above all else, disregarding the potential consequences for the environment and their employees. The vivid description of the factories, as seen in the passage, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" effectively captures the devastating impact of industrialization on the environment and the community. Sinclair highlights the owners' disregard for the harm caused by pollution and the poor conditions surrounding the factories, such as the animal waste and runoff from the pens.\n\nFurthermore, Sinclair illustrates the exploitative nature of the factory owners and managers through their treatment of employees. They are willing to push their workers to their limits, forcing them to work long hours without adequate compensation or concern for their well-being. The quote \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\" effectively conveys the toxic atmosphere of the factories. The lack of regulation and safety measures during the time period allowed the owners to take advantage of their employees, often laying them off without warning or support.\n\nThe novel portrays the workers as being trapped in a system with limited options for escape. They were often forced to live in squalid conditions and work in hazardous environments, with no access to resources or support to improve their situation. The formation of unions, often seen as a means of empowerment for workers, was instead exploited by those in power, further entrenching the problems faced by the working class. The comparison to slavery, as seen in the statement \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\" is a powerful indictment of the system and the treatment of workers during this time.",
            "In the realm of literary technique, authors often employ various methods to elicit a specific emotional response from their readers. While some methods prove more effective than others, F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. One such approach involves juxtaposing an adjective with a noun in an unconventional manner to create a particular aura around a subject. Alternatively, Fitzgerald assigns meaning to a symbol, which he later leverages to evoke a particular emotional response.\n\nFitzgerald's use of symbolism, particularly with regards to colors, is a prime example of this technique. In The Great Gatsby, he establishes a rich tapestry of meanings surrounding several hues, including white, gray, and the reddish-pink spectrum. By consistently associating these colors with specific emotions and connotations, Fitzgerald crafts a nuanced narrative that resonates with readers. In the novel, Fitzgerald skillfully employs the symbolism of white and gray to convey the themes of uniformity, exclusivity, and the passage of time.\n\nThroughout the novel, Fitzgerald sets the tone for these colors by repeatedly depicting them in everyday contexts. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are frequently clad in white, while Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's party. Even the narrator's descriptions of the cityscape and social gatherings reinforce this association, as evidenced by the \"gaudy primary colors\" that pervade Gatsby's party. By assigning these colors to mundane subjects, Fitzgerald reinforces their significance and establishes a sense of unity. This becomes particularly evident in Nick's descriptions of his daily commute and the \"uniform\" facades of apartment buildings.\n\nHowever, Fitzgerald also employs these colors to convey a sense of uniformity and monotony, particularly in relation to Daisy. After establishing the symbolic meaning of white and gray, he begins to associate them with Daisy's character, depicting her as a uniform, almost interchangeable part of Gatsby's world. Her appearance in a \"little white roadster\" serves as a turning point, where readers begin to perceive her as a mere accessory, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. This technique is further reinforced by other instances, such as the \"gray haze\" surrounding her fur collar and her repeated appearances in white dresses.",

The local agricultural scene encompasses a diverse array of crops, including but not limited to tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits such as peaches and lemons, as well as berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for locally produced, organic community-supported agriculture products is substantial, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such sustainable agricultural endeavors allow landowners to capitalize on government programs while fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between land use and habitat conservation, thereby creating opportunities for educational programs, farm tours, and revenue generation.\n\nIn addition to addressing a potentially lucrative market niche, organic farming often yields numerous ecological benefits, including increased biodiversity in local plant and animal species due to the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. Nevertheless, organic farming comes with some drawbacks. It typically demands more manual labor and specialized management to control pests and weeds and to maintain soil health without synthetic chemicals. Losses can be higher than those experienced with conventional farming methods, and small-scale organic farms often face operational inefficiencies compared to larger operations. Furthermore, other beneficial land management practices unrelated to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats or open spaces, can also incur greater labor costs.\n\nThe specific parcel chosen for this scenario is situated near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and encompasses 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This land is located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including several endangered species such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as species that are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, such as the burrowing owl.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native American communities for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood vendors in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of a historic homestead patent and likely served as a grazing area and/or a woodlot for many decades.\n\nTo illustrate the potential challenges and opportunities for a small farmer operating in this region, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched relevant government programs that could help mitigate costs and support wildlife-friendly agricultural practices. I then identified an organic farm in the same area to serve as a model for a hypothetical farm operation.",
            "The dynamics of cultural influence are profound in the negotiation process. However, it's essential to acknowledge that culture can be multifaceted and far-reaching, encompassing not only what it represents but also what it omits. A culture's characteristics cannot be distilled into a single, monolithic entity. Stereotypical assertions such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"the Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the complexities of cultural identity. While general understandings can provide a foundation, it's more productive for negotiators to delve deeper into the nuances of a culture's significance and how it impacts the negotiation. By contextualizing a culture's influence within the specific context of the negotiation, one can better navigate potential challenges.\n\nEngaging with a foreign culture requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing aspects such as historical context, societal norms, and inherent biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's crucial to accept and respect its distinctiveness, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where power dynamics are at play. In foreign territories, embracing local customs and traditions can facilitate smoother negotiations and foster a more collaborative environment.\n\nIt's worth noting that cultural identity extends beyond national or international boundaries. Corporate cultures within a nation can be just as distinct as national cultures. For example, organizational cultures may prioritize long working hours or a more relaxed work-life balance. Observable signs of a corporate culture include dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The varying approaches to philanthropy among companies – some encouraging individual initiative, while others restrict it to approved channels – illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Even within the United States, company cultures can differ significantly, with regional and urban-rural variations adding to the complexity. A uniform exterior can belie a rich tapestry of values and practices waiting to be explored.\n\nUnderstanding values is essential, as they provide the underlying motivations that drive cultural behavior. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony are paramount, a negotiator will likely avoid public embarrassment or conflict to achieve a successful outcome. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize hard-driving negotiations, settlement at the earliest opportunity may not be the primary goal. By considering these general characteristics, negotiators can better prepare for the negotiation table. Nevertheless, gaining insight into an opponent's personal values can significantly enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "In a foundational passage of the Christian Bible, Psalm 14, a profound notion is articulated: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This passage serves as the starting point for the philosophical inquiry of St. Anselm, who also grapples with the concept of the divine in his own work. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas, another prominent thinker, shares similarities with Anselm in his arguments for the existence of a higher power. Given that both authors are advocating for the same theological position, it is essential to acknowledge, for the sake of comparison, that they are both operating within the framework of a monotheistic deity – one that aligns with the traditional understanding of the Christian God. By assuming this common ground, we can effectively examine their arguments without introducing variables that might skew the comparison. Nevertheless, I would contend that, despite the merits of each author's reasoning, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in the divine.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's consider Anselm's central argument. His philosophical approach involves a introspective exploration of the human mind, seeking to uncover evidence of the divine within oneself. Anselm argues that the concept of God's existence is inherent to our understanding, and therefore, we cannot negate it. This idea, while articulated in Anselm's unique terminology, essentially suggests that the proof for God lies in the depths of our own consciousness. He posits that an individual need not rely on external validation, as the truth of God's existence is self-evident within the human mind. This perspective is rooted in the notion of faith, which, within Christian theology, refers to the acceptance of truths that transcend empirical verification.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a reasoning that relies exclusively on logical and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach has significant implications for the practice of evangelism in Christianity, as it would enable the conversion of new adherents without relying on their willingness to accept the unknowable. Aquinas develops five distinct rational arguments – involving change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate the logical necessity of God's existence. Each argument presents a compelling case for the existence of a higher power, one that can be discerned through the logical assembly of observable phenomena. By examining the characteristics of a puzzle, we can infer the presence of a missing piece, even if we have not directly observed it.",
            "Emerging in the distant past, circa the 5th or 6th century BCE, an individual destined for greatness would come to be known as the Buddha. As the years unfolded, he would renounce worldly life and attain profound enlightenment, laying the groundwork for Buddhism—a faith that has evolved significantly over the centuries. Approximately 2,500 years have elapsed since its inception, and its current manifestations bear little resemblance to the original teachings. This phenomenon can be observed in various forms, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. This celebration, while devoid of direct scriptural endorsement, serves as a testament to the dynamic nature of the faith. From the most superficial customs to the fundamental principles of the religion, the Theravada Buddhist community has undergone transformations both from internal and external influences, some benevolent and others hostile.\n\nA critical understanding of the subject necessitates the clarification of certain key terms. The dichotomy between internal and external forces will be a recurring theme in this discussion. An internal force refers to a change originating from within the Buddhist community, irrespective of monastic status. Conversely, an external force denotes any influence exerted by non-Buddhists. A hostile force is characterized by its intent to harm or undermine the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of the faith. In contrast, a benign force is one that neither actively seeks to harm nor assist the community, though its consequences may vary.\n\nTo establish a solid foundation for this analysis, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. The core principles of the faith revolve around the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, comprising the Tripitaka, is the collection of sacred texts that form the basis of Buddhist thought. The Tripitaka consists of three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining the disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, encompassing the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central to these notions are the concepts of Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all phenomena). The recognition of these principles is crucial for transcending the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and for ultimately overcoming the afflictions of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) that accompany enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for laymen, including the five precepts: refraining from harming, lying, stealing, causing harm through illicit behavior, and consuming intoxicating substances. Monks, on the other hand, are subject to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the Four Noble Truths: 1) the existence of Dukkha; 2) the role of attachment in perpetuating suffering; and 3) the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "Bilateral tensions between the United States and Mexico exemplify a long-standing rivalry that persisted for over five decades. From 1836 to 1893, the two nations engaged in a series of confrontations that would eventually subside before the onset of World War I (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The conflict reached its zenith during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States secure Texas and the American Southwest as new territories following a decisive victory over Mexico. The rivalry's trajectory was marked by recurring clashes, including territorial disputes, cultural differences, and competing interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis phenomenon is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship. Neighboring countries often experience rivalries stemming from conflicting interests, cultural disparities, and historical animosities. The United States and Mexico are situated in a comparable context, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations that have posed long-standing diplomatic challenges for the United States (p. 41). Both countries' geographical proximity to the US has contributed to their rivalry, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed more cordial relationships with the US.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations, a recurring theme in international conflicts throughout history (Frahm 2001, p. 86). The ideological underpinnings of the rivalry were rooted in the US's historical opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, which was inherited from the English and Spanish colonial powers. This legacy of mistrust hindered the establishment of a harmonious foreign relationship between the US and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 instances of disputes between the US and Mexico during the 57-year period of rivalry, with the majority of these incidents revolving around territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems (p. 145). The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge, which was eventually mitigated through joint military efforts by both nations (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry between the US and Mexico began to subside as Mexico's economic dependence on the US increased (Schmitt 1974, p. 109), and eventually dissipated as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been a monumental fifteen years since I was suddenly struck down by an illness that shook the very foundations of my existence. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession as a means of securing a sense of stability and comfort that had long eluded me during my tumultuous childhood. The notion that I would always have a steady means of income proved to be a comforting mantra, one that led me to forgo my initial aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist, opting instead for the relative security of a traditional nursing career.\n\nHowever, life had other plans. At the age of 46, I found myself single, financially strained, and unable to work. The years that followed have been a grueling struggle, with Social Security Disability serving as my primary lifeline. Despite my resilience, each day presents a daunting challenge to my well-being, self-esteem, and sense of security. The uncertainty that pervades my life is a harsh reality, one that I have come to accept.\n\nYet, amidst this turmoil, there is one constant that has sustained me: the unwavering support of my loved ones and a handful of close friends. These individuals have been my rock, providing a sense of security and stability that I thought I had left behind. Their selflessness has taught me that true strength lies not in individual resilience, but in the bonds we form with others.\n\nMy experience has instilled in me a profound appreciation for the importance of community and mutual support. In a world where uncertainty is an ever-present reality, it is essential that we learn to rely on one another, to trust in the goodness of those around us. This is a lesson that our nation would do well to remember, particularly in the face of adversity.\n\nWhile it is wise to be prepared for the unexpected, I firmly believe that our society's emphasis on rugged individualism is misguided. The pioneers who settled our great nation did not succeed through self-reliance alone; it was their ability to come together, to share resources and offer support that ultimately led them to their destinations.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, I have taken steps to ensure my preparedness for potential emergencies. I possess a well-stocked disaster kit, complete with essential supplies and a plan for self-sufficiency. However, I firmly believe that the most critical component of any disaster plan is the relationships we nurture with those around us. By fostering a sense of community and trust, we can create a network of support that will see us through even the most trying times.\n\nIn a world where uncertainty reigns, it is essential that we recognize the value of interdependence. By embracing this concept, we can build stronger, more resilient communities that are better equipped to weather the storms of life. So, let us not merely focus on individual preparedness, but also on cultivating the relationships that will ultimately be our greatest source of strength.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a subject of ongoing inquiry. While D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that biologists struggle to define even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms still resonates today, recent advances in mathematical modeling have expanded our understanding of mollusk development. Specifically, researchers have applied statistical models to the development and evolution of shell morphology in mollusks, as exemplified by the work of Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur study aims to investigate the role of mathematical modeling in elucidating the mechanisms governing evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. By combining mathematical modeling with experimental and descriptive studies, we seek to better comprehend the constraints that shape the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change. To achieve this, we employed X-radiographic imaging of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then incorporated into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995) to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change.\n\nThe shell of a mollusk can be conceptualized as a spiral structure that traverses a three-dimensional space over time, comprising a series of whorls that spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated from the next by a continuous line, or suture. In most shells, the final whorl, or body whorl, is the largest, while the spire consists of all whorls except the final one. The apex and base of the shell are defined by the tip of the spire and the opposite end, respectively, and the animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views, with the conventional orientation being apertural, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, one should first observe the shell from the apical view and determine the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nBy tracing the path of the aperture through time and space as the animal constructs its shell, it is possible to represent the shell's development graphically and mathematically. This enables the formulation of a mathematical model, which can then be used to investigate the effects of varying parameters on the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The stagnation of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia over the past decade stands in stark contrast to the country's progress in achieving other Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets.  Despite this, the slow pace of improvement in child and maternal health indicators suggests that additional efforts are necessary to meet the 2015 targets.  A closer examination of the factors contributing to these sluggish advancements reveals a pressing need to bolster the country's overall health infrastructure, rather than solely focusing on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in increasing the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% currently meeting this benchmark.  However, this metric includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the medical expertise to respond to complications during pregnancy, resulting in a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhaging.  Consequently, the apparent progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and further work is required to address the underlying issues.  Moreover, a notable decline in the number of children under five treated by a health professional for diarrheal diseases is a cause for concern.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, the current rates across the country are alarmingly low.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate in Indonesia remains below the expected threshold, at approximately 4%.  This figure is particularly striking in light of the considerable disparity between urban and rural areas, with cesarean rates of 7% in urban settings and a paltry 2% in rural regions.  This stark contrast highlights the unequal distribution of healthcare services, with a clear bias towards urban areas.  Furthermore, the significant gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest quintiles, amounting to 27%, underscores the issue of vertical equity.  The poor are disproportionately hindered in accessing healthcare services, largely due to the financial burden of out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn charting a course for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question arises: how to most effectively address the dearth of services.  Specifically, should Indonesia adopt targeted programmatic approaches or prioritize strengthening its overall health system, without compromising on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and infants.  While program-specific initiatives may offer a tempting solution, they come with significant drawbacks.  One major concern is that investing heavily in a particular area can divert resources away from other vital sectors, leading to a brain drain of skilled personnel towards more resource-rich areas, as seen in the case of the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on the family planning sector.  Moreover, the proliferation of parallel programs for a single area can result in duplication of services, inefficiencies, and an overwhelming burden of paperwork and administrative tasks.",
            "The Victorian era is marked by its fastidious attention to minute particulars and its preoccupation with the upper echelons of society.  However, two novels that diverge from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, both of which incorporate elements of enigma and a penchant for the unconventional, characteristics that deviate from the standard expectations of the period. These unconventional aspects serve to heighten the depth of character within each narrative, providing a more nuanced understanding of their motivations and emotional landscapes.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is underscored by vivid and unsettling visions that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. A telling example of this is evident in the following passage from the novel, where the protagonist's thoughts are consumed by a maelstrom of disorienting ideas:\n\n\"As he walked, the din of argument between Sikes and Crackit receded into the background, their words echoing in his mind. But when he focused his attention, he found himself locked in a heated conversation with them. Sudden gunfire shattered the air, and a cacophony of cries and shouts erupted around him. He felt an unseen force propelling him through the chaos, as his senses reeled from the proximity of pain.\"\n\nThis technique is often employed through the use of dream sequences or dreamlike states in both novels, though the specific purpose and execution differ in each. In Oliver Twist, such visions frequently offer insights into Oliver's inner world, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of Oliver's shooting in chapter 28 is a poignant example of this, where the traumatic event is relived in vivid detail, underscoring the protagonist's lack of agency in the face of adversity. The passage highlights Oliver's disorientation and despair, as his senses are overwhelmed by the shock of pain, which has become a constant and debilitating presence in his life.\n\nThe question of culpability for Oliver's misfortune is thus raised, as it is clear that his fate is not entirely his own. The passage implies a sense of powerlessness on Oliver's part, as if he is unable to exert control over the events unfolding around him, even when his very life is at stake. Furthermore, the narrative suggests a growing sense of resignation in Oliver, as if he has been worn down by the relentless pressures of his circumstances, rendering him increasingly unable to resist or react to his environment.\n\nIn this same vein, another passage from the novel captures the disorienting quality of time, where the protagonist's perceptions of day and night are distorted:\n\n\"The day had passed – or rather, it had not. Time seemed to be in a state of flux, with day and night blurring into one another in an endless cycle of darkness and light.\"",
            "My experience as an after-school program tutor for elementary students has given me a unique perspective on the challenges of language barriers in education, particularly in California. I recall a particular case that still resonates with me – a student named Adrian, who was experiencing reading difficulties despite speaking perfect English. What struck me was the irregularity of his reading struggles, which hinted at an underlying issue. As it turned out, Adrian was familiar with the English language but lacked a solid grasp of the alphabet and pronunciation. This experience has stuck with me, and I've come to realize that even native English speakers can face substantial obstacles when it comes to reading.\n\nThis experience serves as a testament to the complexities of addressing language barriers in schools. It's not always immediately apparent, even in students who seem to have a strong command of the language. In Adrian's case, targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no one-size-fits-all approach; a combination of strategies is necessary.\n\nOne potential solution is the dual language education system. Research has shown that students participating in two-way bilingual programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and limited benefits, the benefits of these programs extend to all students, not just those with Spanish as their first language. By implementing these programs as the norm rather than the exception, we can unlock academic success for all students.\n\nTo make this a reality, we don't need to require every teacher to be bilingual. That would be impractical and unrealistic. Instead, we can utilize bilingual support staff, such as tutors or instructional aids, to complement the instruction. This approach would allow us to provide students with the support they need to succeed, regardless of their linguistic background. By combining effective teaching methods, bilingual support, and a commitment to inclusivity, we can create a more equitable educational environment for all students.",
            "The notion that there exists something greater than ourselves has been an enduring theme in human perception from an early age. This concept is often explored through various forms of spiritual inquiry, whether it's a Sunday school education, a temple visit, or introspective contemplation. Many adhere to the faith passed down from their ancestors, while others reject it altogether, convinced that their personal universe is the only truth. People frequently oscillate between different value systems as they navigate their own spiritual journeys. Ultimately, we are all searching for a guiding light to illuminate our path, dispelling the shadows that surround us.\n\nI recall a conversation with my father, who shared with me his fondness for cardinals. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain pelt against the roof, the sound muffled by the tin exterior. The downspouts funneled the rain onto the plants, drowning them in a small, desolate pool. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes a mixture of introspection and reminiscence. His appearance had changed – his hair thinned, his clothes hung loosely from his frame. I sensed a deep sadness emanating from him, and our conversation was tinged with an unspoken awareness that this might be our last moment together. I chose not to confront the impending reality, instead opting to share a moment of quiet companionship with him.\n\nMy father's battle with illness ended just five days after my 22nd birthday in December. The treatments had prolonged his life, but at what cost, I couldn't fathom. I wondered about the nature of a benevolent deity, one that would allow such suffering. That night, I chose not to pray, and instead, I questioned the existence of a higher power that seemed indifferent to my pleas.\n\nI had decided not to witness his passing, unable to bear the thought of watching the person who brought me into this world slip away. I opted to remember my father through the memories of his life, rather than the circumstances of his death. I knew him better than others, and I believed he would have preferred it that way. For three days, I stayed hidden in my bed, waiting for news that would confirm the inevitable.\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.",
            "The Gothic Novel, a genre often perceived as an incongruous blend of the old and the new, was, as Ian Watt astutely observed, 'the epitome of dualities,' where anachronistic elements commingled with modern literary sensibilities. Since its inception, the Gothic genre has been subject to a wide range of reactions, from scathing criticism to effusive praise, with some dismissing it as a shallow exercise in sensationalism, while others extolled its capacity to evoke a sense of 'the terrible sublime' (Burke). The pioneering work, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the rich tapestry of medieval romances and modern novelistic conventions to create a new literary paradigm. By juxtaposing antiquated theatrical elements with the nascent novel's capacity for psychological insight, Walpole initiated a genre that would endure through the ages, paradoxically, both antiquated and innovative in its appeal.\n\nThe Gothic genre's affinity for medieval motifs, derived from theatre, architecture, and tradition, added to its aura of mystique. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term 'Gothic' was employed to describe a range of disparate cultural and artistic movements, often connoting an air of antiquity or rustic simplicity in the face of modernity's triumphant march. The confluence of the theatrical and the novelistic, with its capacity to convey the inner lives of characters, helped to ensure the Gothic genre's longevity, rendering it simultaneously a relic of the past and a fresh, exciting discovery for readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic concepts is the ideal of chivalry, a medieval notion that underwent significant transformations in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry's emphasis on the virtuous knight, epitomized by bravery, honor, and competence, resonated deeply with Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, who lamented the decline of this ideal in his own society. By invoking the chivalric code, Gothic authors created a sanitized, romanticized representation of the past, which would eventually influence the development of Romanticism. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's character Frederic embodies this ideal, as described in the following passage:\n\nFrederic, a prince of noble lineage, has suffered the slings of fate and emerged scarred, his character tempered by adversity. His gallant and courteous demeanor, although exaggerated for effect, introduces the theme of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre. This image of the 'gallant and courteous Knight' prefigures the trope of the overwrought, which would come to characterize the genre.",
            "The logistical orchestration of goods, from initial raw materials to final customer delivery, encompasses the multifaceted processes of supply chain management. This concept, first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, involves strategically planning, implementing, and controlling the entire sequence to meet customer demands efficiently. The six core components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory management, geographical positioning, transportation, and data integration.\n\nEffective supply chain management relies on a thorough understanding of these components. Production forms the foundational stage of the process, where manufacturers outline the production timeline, including the 'when,' 'why,' 'where,' and 'how' of production. To inform these decisions, managers must first analyze market trends and customer preferences. By considering the market's pulse, manufacturers can determine the most sought-after products and quantities to produce. This market-driven approach enables managers to allocate production resources efficiently and maximize customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce the production plan is established, the next step is to decide on the production location and facility, taking into account factors such as volume, quality, and customer demand. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment is also crucial to ensuring a smooth production process. Every detail, no matter how seemingly minor, plays a vital role in the supply chain's success, as inconsistencies can lead to significant losses in time and resources in the long run. For instance, retailers like Wal-Mart and Target employ detailed blueprints and protocols for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, to minimize confusion and ensure seamless execution.\n\nSupply, the second critical element in supply chain management, involves making strategic decisions regarding a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. This may involve identifying the optimal internal divisions for various production processes or deciding to outsource specific tasks to external companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while minimizing costs and maintaining flexibility. By leveraging these strategic choices, companies can optimize their supply chain operations and stay competitive in the market.",
            "In a striking visual statement, Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a sign with a provocative message in her hand in Burma, a Southeast Asian nation currently governed by a military junta that seized power in 1962. The sign, scribbled with a Sharpie, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, officially known as Myanmar, has a complex and tumultuous history marked by periods of authoritarian rule and public protests. In 2007, a wave of street protests, dubbed the Saffron Revolution, swept the country after a decade of relative calm. Led by a large number of Buddhist monks, the protests drew international attention, albeit briefly, before escalating into violence, with reports of military crackdowns and ransacking of monasteries. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed while covering a protest in September 2007. Officially, 13 deaths were reported, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the military, estimated that the true toll was much higher, with thousands of bodies left uncounted.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. The desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain control over their populations is a recurring theme throughout history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority to govern, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people. In modern times, the actions of leaders have been no less concerning. The Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, for instance, saw intellectuals, activists, and students gather in Beijing to demand greater freedoms, resulting in a disputed death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militias and government forces targeted Tutsis and moderates, is another stark example. The Holocaust, during which millions of Jews were systematically persecuted and killed, is a harrowing reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed to a unique combination of his remarkable longevity and compositional prowess. His remarkable ability to cultivate a cohesive ensemble identity lent itself to numerous iconic works that harmoniously integrated the talents of individual band members. While Ellington's piano presence may be understated in certain compositions, his skill as a composer lies in crafting intricate, layered pieces that showcased the distinctive strengths of each musician. By skillfully blending soloistic freedom with tightly woven orchestration, he created a musical landscape where each player could shine, whether through improvisation or carefully calibrated phrasing. This masterful approach enabled Ellington to craft some of the most innovative and groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nThe esteemed Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a melodic instrument, evident in his early work, Creole Love Call. By incorporating vocal elements throughout his career, Ellington successfully added depth and nuance to his compositions without the confines of traditional lyrics. This 12-bar blues piece exemplifies his ability to complement the unique styles of his soloists, which remained a hallmark of his career. The structure of Creole Love Call consists of six distinct choruses:\n\n1. A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, commencing with a smooth, melodic tone that gradually gives way to a more rugged timbre.\n2. A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the core melody, emphasizing elongated notes and subtle nuances.\n3. A soaring clarinet solo, elevated by a syncopated piano accompaniment in a high register.\n4. The full ensemble recreates the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between brass and reed sections.\n5. A climactic finale, as the reeds now initiate the call-and-response, backed by staccato stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the initial structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds; in this final chorus, the vocalist adopts a \"growl\" technique, soloing as a true instrumental voice.\n\nThe piece concludes with a concise tag, featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, striking conclusion courtesy of a trombone.\n\nEllington's strategic incorporation of vocal elements to enhance his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his oeuvre, as seen in his subsequent works. Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, showcases Ellington's deft orchestration and keen ear for tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing masterfully blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, yielding a rich and complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further exemplifying his ability to harness the unique strengths of each musician.",
            "A sense of emptiness had been prevalent in her life for what felt like an eternity. This unfulfilled longing had begun to manifest itself around the age of fourteen, as she navigated the challenges of adolescence. Several years later, at the age of seventeen, this feeling persisted, but her perspective had shifted. She now yearned for human connection rather than mere material possessions. However, her lack of interest in the opposite sex had left her puzzled and introspective. Some individuals had attempted to woo her, but none had sparked her genuine interest. She frequently questioned her own desires, seeking to comprehend the root cause of this unusual phenomenon.\n\nHer home life was generally tranquil, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. They rarely argued with each other, and disagreements with their daughter were infrequent. Their infrequent disagreements revolved around her strong will and independent nature, which often created a delightful contrast to her parents' more reserved personalities. Her unique blend of warmth and kindness made her well-liked by those around her.\n\nOn this particular day, however, the atmosphere was far from peaceful. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was startled by a faint cry of distress coming from the kitchen. Her mother's voice, typically melodious, was now tinged with pain. She rushed into the room, alarm etched on her face, and frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing in agony as she took short, labored breaths. Her daughter hastened to her side, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's arm. \"Ow... sweetheart, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother replied, her words rushed and laced with distress. Her daughter quickly assessed the situation and sprang into action. \"Okay, Mom, where am I picking you up?\" she asked, trying to stay calm. Her mother directed her, and her daughter was grateful for the physical training she had received. With a sense of resolve, she carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and the air of anxiety that accompanied it were palpable, but her daughter's focus remained solely on her mother's well-being. She swiftly escorted her mother into the hospital and alerted the medical staff, who quickly gathered around. A gurney was brought, and her mother was gently placed on it. The doctors and nurses quickly attended to her, while her daughter was left to anxiously wait.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the top shelf.",
            "A large-scale observational study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (Med Diet) and the incidence of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke in women. The study used a modified version of the Med Diet, known as the Alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet, which emphasizes a higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as moderate intake of fish and low consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption was also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have consistently shown an inverse association between adherence to the Med Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. Notably, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated the Med Diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles among obese individuals. However, prior research had not specifically examined the relationship between the Med Diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study drew upon the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term cohort study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The study enrolled 74,886 women aged 38-63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, participants completed six self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to assess their nutrient intake. The FFQs were validated through independent review of medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions were classified as \"probable\" cases due to lack of documentation.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and better capture long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. The analysis controlled for potential confounding factors, including age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. Separate models were used to analyze fatal and non-fatal CHD and stroke events.\n\nThe results showed a significant association between higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed score, and lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2,391 incident CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths were documented. Women with the highest aMed scores exhibited a lower risk of CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "A pivotal moment in American financial history occurred in 2007, when the nation's economic stability began to unravel. The consequences of this crisis remain evident, with unemployment rates on the rise and several prominent corporations struggling to recover. It is essential to examine the underlying causes of this economic downturn and explore potential solutions to prevent future catastrophes.\n\nA critical examination of the events leading up to the crisis reveals a pattern of poor decision-making and inadequate regulatory oversight. Financial institutions, under pressure from both government policies and investors, extended large sums of credit to borrowers who lacked the means to repay. This reckless lending strategy, coupled with an inadequate financial infrastructure, created a perfect storm that eventually collapsed. The proliferation of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and other complex financial instruments only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nHistorical records indicate that the seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, when the Clinton administration relaxed lending standards in an effort to boost public support. Fannie Mae, a leading provider of mortgage financing, was under pressure to expand its lending activities and maintain its growth trajectory. A 1999 article by Steven Holmes of the New York Times noted that Fannie Mae was driven to increase its mortgage lending among low-income borrowers, despite concerns about the potential risks. Holmes astutely predicted that such actions could lead to a government bailout, similar to the one implemented in the 1980s for the savings and loan industry.\n\nThe crisis was further fueled by the widespread adoption of complex financial products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These instruments allowed households and financial institutions to take on excessive risk, leaving them vulnerable to even minor market fluctuations. The consequences were catastrophic, as the housing market bubble burst, and financial institutions were left reeling. The top U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. In the aftermath, several major financial institutions were forced to restructure or face intense regulatory scrutiny, while Fannie and Freddie were placed under government control, with a combined mortgage debt of $5 trillion.",
            "The dreaded exposition. A narrative device that can either elevate your writing to new heights or induce a collective yawn from your readers. Dr. Thompson has been known to mutter under her breath when faced with a lengthy passage of backstory, the words \"Show, don't tell\" echoing in her mind.\n\nWhile the adage is well-worn, Dr. Thompson still finds herself slipping into the trap of excessive narration. It's as if the critic within her voice whispers, \"Get the groundwork out of the way, get to the good stuff.\" This inner dialogue is not to be confused with the more persuasive voice urging her to reveal the intricacies of each character's past.\n\nExposition, in essence, is the act of telling rather than showing. It's the cinematic equivalent of a character dumping a wealth of information on another character, à la a filmic rendition of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, the author takes on this role.\n\nConsider a common scenario: a heroine meets her love interest at a specific time and place, they exchange vows in a grand ceremony, and tragically, he meets a violent end. One wouldn't expect this sequence to occupy an extended period, during which the husband and wife barely exchange a few lines of dialogue. A more effective approach would be to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his devotion through his words and actions. Similarly, the heroine's transformation in the wake of his loss should be palpable, conveyed through her thoughts, behaviors, and interactions. This nuanced portrayal would allow readers to form an emotional connection with the couple and the heroine, ultimately making her grief more relatable and impactful.\n\nIn other words, a compelling narrative requires more than just the skeletal framework of \"They met, they married, he died.\" It demands the meat that brings the story to life.\n\nAs a writer, one must resist the temptation to rush past key details, such as a character's background. Take, for instance, a character who has a rich history – serving in the military, working as a night manager at a gas station, having been married twice, and harboring dreams of entrepreneurship. A brief summary of these facts might seem convenient, but it would only serve to leave readers with a vague impression. A more effective approach would be to seamlessly integrate these details into the narrative, allowing the character to emerge as a fully fleshed-out individual.",
            "I recently watched multiple broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first live segment caught my attention, which was a story about a violent incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was arrested for allegedly stabbing his wife, although her name was not disclosed. The news team presented his mug shot, which was striking. Despite its developing nature, the story received around two minutes of coverage. I believe this was a reasonable allocation of time.\n\nThe second report focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, where an 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, was critically injured. At the time, there were no suspects or arrests. The SWAT team was involved in the investigation. I noticed a relatively brief coverage, which might have been due to the fact that the incident occurred in a predominantly minority neighborhood. I have observed a pattern, which suggests that minority victims often receive less media attention than those from other backgrounds. This disparity in coverage is a concern I have been aware of for some time.\n\nThe subsequent story highlighted a gunshot wound discovered on a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided information about the suspected location and circumstances of the incident. Authorities believe a .22 caliber rifle was used, firing a bullet that hit the aircraft. A $5,000 reward was announced for tips that lead to the identification of the shooter.\n\nThe next segment addressed a weather forecast for the upcoming weekend, predicting rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to range from the mid to low eighties. This story was likely included as a \"preview\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAnother report focused on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie and standing at around six feet tall and 150 pounds. The news team emphasized his racial characteristics, which seemed unusual.\n\nFinally, a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual from Texas, was presented. He had been involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation, conspiring to distribute the substance from Texas to Ohio. I found it intriguing that instead of stating his prison sentence as 25 years, the news team mentioned \"300 months.\" It's unclear whether this was intended to convey a harsher punishment or not. Additionally, the mention of his Hispanic heritage seemed unnecessary.",
            "An intriguing aspect of human relationships is the profound connection that exists between siblings, particularly brothers. This bond is multifaceted and can encompass a range of complex emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and the capacity for cruelty. Brothers often possess an uncanny understanding of one another, which can be attributed to their unique bond. In times of crisis, the true nature of this connection is revealed, often showcasing both positive and negative traits. When these emotions become apparent, they can have far-reaching consequences.\n\nOne notable literary work, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" explores this theme in depth. Set against the backdrop of a vibrant and detailed landscape, the narrative follows two brothers as they embark on a perilous journey. The story reaches its climax as bitter disappointment and intense pride collide, resulting in a tragic outcome where only one brother survives. The author masterfully conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his brother through direct characterization and the narrator's perspective.\n\nThe protagonist's actions throughout the story can be largely attributed to his fixation on a single emotion: pride. From their initial outings to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had envisioned having a partner with whom he could share his interests and skills, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's physical limitations, a result of his weak heart, made these aspirations unattainable. The protagonist's disappointment and frustration are palpable, and he even grapples with the idea of suffocating his brother, a notion that raises questions about the depths of his emotions. Nevertheless, the brother's simple smile brings a glimmer of hope, revealing a more nuanced aspect of the protagonist's character.",
            "The cerebral cortex is a multifaceted, adaptive information-processing apparatus. As technological advancements unfold, the analogies employed to describe its functioning have undergone significant evolution. Initially, the brain was likened to a parchment, then to a scroll, and subsequently to a codex. Presently, the computer analogy has gained widespread acceptance. It's essential to acknowledge that these metaphors, although useful, have limitations and can lead to misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing commences with the reception of sensory data from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli, such as tactile sensations, thermal cues, acoustic waves, or photons, into electrochemical impulses. The processed sensory information undergoes iterative transformations through a combination of bottom-up and top-down processing mechanisms. For instance, when perceiving an image of a black square on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles fundamental components like color, orientation, and spatial boundaries – where color transitions significantly over a short distance – to infer the presence of a rectangular object. Top-down processing employs the decisions generated at intermediate stages of the bottom-up process to expedite recognition of the object. Top-down processing in this example might facilitate the identification of the object as a black square rather than a square-shaped recess in the white background.\n\nUpon achieving a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines the signal's priority and allocates access to relevant cognitive processes. For example, although the brain processes every individual blade of grass when gazing downwards, a healthy attention filter prevents conscious awareness of these details. Conversely, you might readily identify your name even in a noisy environment. There are numerous stages of processing, and the outcomes are modulated by attention at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first be stored within its internal frameworks. Various types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods tailored to specific types of sensory stimuli. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic characteristics, or semantic meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained through a series of mechanisms. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on a transient electrical signal propagated through a sequence of neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained through the structural organization of certain types of proteins.\n\nSeveral models have been proposed to describe the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing from various disciplines such as human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits the existence of nodes representing concepts, which are interconnected based on their semantic relationships. For example, in a semantic network, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In his dystopian novel, Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a scathing critique of the emerging technocratic and capitalist systems of his time. The novel's citizens are conditioned to prioritize collective well-being over individuality, with their desires manipulated by the ruling World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, the work can be seen as a commentary on the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the exploitation of the masses. The novel's use of terms such as homogeny and reification suggests that Huxley was concerned about the homogenization of society and the reduction of people to mere commodities.\n\nThe novel also satirizes capitalism by illustrating the concept of false consciousness, where the working class is kept ignorant of their true relationship to the ruling elite. The conditioning of the population through hypnopædia ensures that they are driven by a desire for consumption and indulgence, rather than critical thinking or independent decision-making. This is a classic example of ideological control, where the ruling class maintains its power by manipulating the perceptions and desires of the masses.\n\nThe social hierarchy in Brave New World is also a clear illustration of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over the rest of society. The lower classes are unaware of their oppression, while the upper classes are complicit in their own subjugation. This is evident in the interactions between characters, which are superficial and lacking in depth. The novel suggests that the pursuit of material wealth and status has eroded the capacity for genuine human connection and emotion, leaving individuals feeling isolated and disconnected.\n\nFurthermore, the novel's portrayal of relationships between characters highlights the effects of capitalism on human relationships. The emphasis on physical appearance and superficial interactions is a commentary on the ways in which capitalism reduces people to commodities and objects of desire. The complacency of the lower classes in their assigned roles within the social hierarchy is also a reflection of Marxist ideas about the proletariat, who are manipulated into believing they are superior to others as long as they conform to societal expectations and continue to consume and obey.\n\nBy examining Brave New World through a Marxist framework, it becomes clear that Huxley was warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the exploitation of the masses by capitalist systems. His novel remains a powerful commentary on the consequences of a society that prioritizes material wealth and status over individual freedom and human connection.",
            "I've been a part of the University Park community for a little over two and a half years now. One of the challenges many of us face is navigating the campus. During my first year, I was housed in an East Halls dorm, situated at the eastern edge of campus. Commuting from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, situated near the heart of campus, often took around 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. A conversation with an alumnus roughly my age shed light on the campus's past development. In the not-so-distant past, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by a significant expanse of undeveloped land. This vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new facilities like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly complicated. To effectively address the issue, I believe the bicycle offers a viable solution. However, owning a bike is merely the first step – students must also take advantage of it, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with cyclists' needs in mind.\n\nDiscussing the benefits of cycling with a friend who resumed riding after a hiatus highlighted its appeal. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. After a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise, one can cover significant distances. Given that I reside off-campus, about the same distance from the campus center as some dorms, acquiring a bike has been one of the best decisions I've made. Daily classes in the Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, can now be reached in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a decent pace. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, presents some challenges, regardless of the mode of transportation. In my opinion, cycling is the most suitable option, considering my busy schedule. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation, which would not only be time-consuming but also impractical given my daily commitments. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, translating to over two and a half hours per week. When factoring in other walking time for classes, appointments, and other activities, this becomes unsustainable."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",

Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.

We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.

            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.

This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.

Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "Through my pursuit of a social work education, I aim to forge a career with the Division of Family and Children Services, where I can make a meaningful impact on the lives of vulnerable children who have experienced abuse or neglect, as well as provide essential support to troubled families. The guiding principles I plan to uphold in this field include: a commitment to service, respect for individuals and their unique experiences, a strong sense of ethics, and a dedication to fostering positive relationships and personal growth. These core values not only resonate deeply with the social work profession, but are also essential to my own personal growth and development.\n\nPrior to discovering my passion for social work, I grappled with defining my career path. Throughout my high school and college years, I witnessed individuals struggling to cope with challenges, often relying on unhealthy mechanisms to escape their problems. This exposure led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, yet I still felt uncertain about my long-term career goals. Following my graduation from Piedmont College in 2009, I took a break to explore my options. It was during this time that I had a pivotal experience that altered my perspective. A friend introduced me to a 16-year-old boy who was facing a difficult home life. His story touched my heart, and I felt compelled to help. I reached out to the authorities, leveraging my recent graduation in Psychology to facilitate a conversation with the boy's parents. Their dismissive responses and lack of accountability for their actions sparked a realization within me: the need for compassionate, informed support systems in situations like these. This experience solidified my interest in social work, driving me to pursue a career that would enable me to support children and families in crisis.\n\nAnother essential value in the field of social work is social justice. Our society often extols the importance of individuality, yet frequently restricts self-expression and conformity. This paradoxical dynamic has long fascinated me, and I believe that social work offers a unique opportunity to challenge these norms. Throughout my educational journey, I have actively advocated for social justice, embracing individuality and self-expression in my own life. From expressing my personal style through unconventional fashion choices to participating in social justice movements, I have consistently sought to challenge societal expectations and promote inclusivity.",
            "The following dissertation undertakes an in-depth examination of the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in relation to the complex phenomenon of insomnia. The biological paradigm centres around the genetic and physiological determinants of sleep disturbances, while the sociocultural model delves into the environmental and demographic influences that shape our understanding of sleep patterns. This comprehensive review synthesizes existing research to elucidate the intricacies of both models, highlighting key findings and evaluating their strengths and limitations.\n\nInsomnia can be categorised into primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders comorbid with mental health conditions, or sleep disorders precipitated by medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssonmias, including Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, and other related conditions, which are characterised by disturbances in sleep initiation, maintenance, or duration. Conversely, Parasomnias are sleep disorders manifesting as behavioural or physiological abnormalities, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, and Sleepwalking Disorder. This review focuses on insomnia and its relationship to the biological and sociocultural models, with a particular emphasis on the primary sleep disorders.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders posits that genetic and heritable factors, as well as physiological mechanisms, contribute to sleep disturbances. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus, specifically those containing orexin, play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles. A study employing mice as a model found that phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons are responsible for modulating sleep-wake states. Activation of the GABAA receptor induces sleep-promoting responses, whereas inhibition of this receptor can lead to reduced anxiety and enhanced sleep. The administration of the GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This research suggests that animal models can be extrapolated to human studies, revealing a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A deficiency or malfunction of this receptor may compromise an individual's ability to achieve adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implications of this study are far-reaching, as the inheritance of the phenotype could regulate sleep patterns, and any alterations to the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, ultimately affecting various aspects of daily life, including academic, professional, and mundane tasks.",
            "The complexities of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD) are multifaceted, encompassing three distinct areas of examination. Initially, a concise overview of this condition is provided, followed by an in-depth exploration of diagnosis, including key indicators or 'red flags.' The paper concludes with practical suggestions for educators in mainstreamed classrooms to support students affected by CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), refers to the brain's ability to process auditory information. This entails the efficacious utilization of auditory cues by the central nervous system (CNS), which is responsible for processing and interpreting sound. In essence, individuals afflicted with CAPD can hear sounds within the normal range, yet their brain struggles to decipher and separate distinct auditory inputs, such as speech from background noise (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Consequently, the brain's auditory processing centers fail to function as intended, hindering the ability to comprehend and analyze auditory information.\n\nHistorically, CAPD has been recognized since the mid-1950s under the term 'auditory imperception' (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers during this period, including the Italian team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing assessments for children with communication disorders in 1954. Subsequently, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiological mechanisms underlying dichotic perception in 1961 (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). The 1977 national conference further catalyzed research into CAPD in children.\n\nCAPD manifests itself in various ways, including difficulties with sound localization, the ability to distinguish between multiple auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, and differentiating changes in speech. Individuals with CAPD may experience challenges in filtering out background noises, synthesizing sound patterns, and determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre). Moreover, they may struggle to recognize subtle differences in speech, such as detecting sarcasm through changes in tone.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation is conducted, encompassing systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests. Professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists utilize a range of assessments to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally reliable diagnostic tool or test, and the underlying causes of CAPD remain unknown. Diagnostic approaches often involve presenting patients with multiple auditory stimuli and asking them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced assessments involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "In the play Twelfth Night, the concept of deception is portrayed as a double-edged sword, capable of both facilitating deception and ultimately leading to self-discovery.  On one hand, adopting a disguise can be a means to achieve temporary protection or gain, as exemplified by Viola's decision to disguise herself as a man. This ruse allows her to survive in a foreign land and secure her safety. However, this disguise also leads to the alienation of her support system, particularly her female peers, thereby rendering her isolated in a setting where she is in need of solace.\n\nFurthermore, Viola's successful impersonation as a man creates a complex situation, where she inadvertently incites romantic feelings in both Olivia and Orsino. Olivia's infatuation with Cesario, Viola's disguise, raises questions about the nature of her true desires, with some speculating that her affections may be rooted in societal expectations rather than genuine attraction. Conversely, Orsino's suppressed emotions towards women are laid bare through his interactions with Cesario, a dynamic that may be seen as a progressive exploration of repressed desires.\n\nThe portrayal of deception in Twelfth Night highlights the intricate relationship between identities, relationships, and deception. By exploring the complexities of disguise, Shakespeare raises fundamental questions about the human need for self-preservation versus the preservation of social bonds. In the end, the play suggests that deception can be a catalyst for self-discovery, but it also underscores the importance of authenticity in our interactions with others.\n\nIn this sense, Twelfth Night can be seen as a commentary on the fluidity of identity and the complexities of human relationships. The play's exploration of deception as a tool for self-discovery challenges the audience to consider the consequences of adopting a false persona and the repercussions on one's relationships and sense of self.",
            "The German colonial administration has been characterized by several notable aspects, particularly in its treatment of the Ovaherero and Nama populations in German South West Africa. However, the colonial empire's multifaceted nature, encompassing diverse policies and governance styles, defies a simplistic characterization. The provision of education across the colonies displayed a similar degree of diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they discovered a sizable population of educated and literate Africans, a testament to the effectiveness of German educational initiatives in certain regions. Conversely, German efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary observers for their quality.\n\nIn stark contrast, the situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a striking disparity. Unlike in East Africa, where the colonial government actively invested in the establishment of state schools and played a significant role in the education of the native population, in South West Africa the responsibility for native education fell largely to missionary organizations that received limited official support. Nevertheless, the government did allocate significant resources towards the education of European settlers in the colony, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial support and regulation to missionary institutions. The long-term consequences of these educational policies in South West Africa were far-reaching, persisting even after the conclusion of German rule. In contrast, other German colonies boasted a notable number of literate and educated Africans, whereas in South West Africa, the vast majority of the population remained uneducated and illiterate. A combination of social, economic, and political factors contributed to this divergent experience, warranting further investigation.\n\nExisting research on education in the German colonial empire is extensive and has been conducted by scholars from a range of backgrounds. The majority of these studies were written in German during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule, with a primary focus on describing the characteristics of educational systems in the various colonies. Later studies, written in English, expanded the scope of inquiry through comparative analyses of education in different German colonies and more detailed examinations of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems of distinct colonies. One of the most notable works is Cohen's comparative study of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which sheds light on the factors contributing to the differences between the two colonies. Cohen attributes many of the distinguishing features of South West Africa's educational system to its relatively large settler population.\n\nIn contrast to other German colonies, South West Africa presented a moderately temperate climate, despite being largely dominated by arid desert terrain. The European population in South West Africa capitalized on these relatively favorable conditions, with nearly 15,000 settlers residing in the colony by 1913. This figure surpassed the settler population in the colony with the next largest number of European residents, East Africa, which boasted approximately 5,336 settlers at the same time.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has been marked by an explosion of diverse genres, making it increasingly challenging to catalog them comprehensively. Furthermore, many of these genres, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into numerous sub-genres, further complicating the classification process. One of the most dynamic and expressive genres to emerge in recent decades is heavy metal, which has undergone an extraordinary transformation in the past 40 years.\n\nCharacterized by its emotional depth, heavy metal music tends to explore the darker aspects of the human experience, often with a sense of raw intensity. This genre's versatility has been its hallmark, as artists have continually pushed the boundaries of what is possible, giving rise to an astonishing array of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres. As a result, the heavy metal movement has become increasingly fragmented, with numerous niches and styles emerging, making it difficult to define its core essence.\n\nTo grasp the complexities of modern metal music, it is essential to understand its historical context and the factors that have shaped it. Metal is, at its core, a genre that embodies the counterculture ethos of the late 1960s and 1970s, marked by a rejection of mainstream values and a quest for creative freedom. The influence of psychedelic substances during this era contributed to a shift towards more experimental and avant-garde sounds, as artists sought to push the limits of their art. This experimentation led to the development of metal's distinctive sonic characteristics, including its emphasis on volume, intensity, and theatricality.\n\nThe genre's affinity for the darker aspects of human experience has been fueled by its ability to tap into the Romantic Era's fascination with the sublime and the unknown. This is evident in the lyrics of many metal songs, which often explore themes of mortality, existential crises, and the human condition. The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter,\" for example, is often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, and its lyrics reflect the darker, more intense atmosphere that characterized the genre's early days.",
            "A remarkable French artist, Henri Rousseau, predated the surrealist movement by several decades, yet his own artistic explorations of the subconscious were already taking shape in the early 20th century. His 1910 masterpiece, 'The Dream', serves as a poignant reflection of the artist's own aspirations and internal conflicts. Confronted with the daunting task of gaining recognition from the art community, Rousseau found himself torn between the desire for creative autonomy and the pressure to conform to established styles. This dichotomy is perhaps the most prominent theme in 'The Dream', a painting that encapsulates Rousseau's lifelong struggle to reconcile his unique artistic vision with the expectations of the art world.\n\nTo understand the significance of 'The Dream', it is essential to delve into Rousseau's personal history. Born in Laval, a small town in northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau was born into a family with a modest background. His father was a successful tinsmith and hardware merchant, and Rousseau's upbringing was marked by a relatively comfortable upbringing. Despite a lack of formal artistic training, Rousseau began his working life at a young age, eventually finding employment with the French municipal toll service. His role as a gabelou, or toll collector, would later be rebranded as a douanier, or customs inspector, a moniker that would become synonymous with his artistic persona.\n\nThe loss of his first wife, Clémence, who died alongside eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one daughter, Julia, and a profound sense of grief. As a means of coping with his emotional pain, Rousseau turned to painting, seeking solace in the creative process. Unlike his contemporaries, who often romanticized the peasant class, Rousseau's artwork was rooted in his own experiences and the realities of everyday life. His desire for recognition and acceptance from the art world is all the more understandable given his late start in life and the presence of more established artists, such as Matisse, who was gaining recognition during the same period.\n\nJan Gordon, author of Modern French Painters, notes that while Matisse and Rousseau were technically competitors in the art world, they differed fundamentally in their approaches and motivations. Matisse sought to avoid clichés, while Rousseau aimed to create works that were so conventional that they would earn him a place within the Artiste Français circle.",
            "In the realm of human understanding, a profound interplay exists between the realms of ethics and aesthetics, truth and beauty. This intricate connection has long been acknowledged by some of the most discerning minds, including John Keats, who, in his celebrated \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" poignantly captures the essence of this relationship, stating, \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While education and experience shape our comprehension of the world, our appreciation for ethics and aesthetics often transcends these conventional bounds, echoing Keats' words.\n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics aim to elucidate rather than dictate, striving to explain the underlying qualities that render a work of art or literature beautiful or an action morally sound, rather than prescribing a set of rigid guidelines. A closer examination of art and morality reveals that our interpretations often meander around the periphery, discussing aspects like composition, cultural context, or historical significance, yet somehow fall short of capturing the quintessence of what makes something truly remarkable. When discussing a favorite work, it's common to hear a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth analysis. This phenomenon suggests that both art and morality possess an intrinsic quality that cannot be fully encapsulated by description.\n\nAs Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" This notion resonates with the notion that ethics, too, has a transcendent quality that defies complete articulation. Ludwig Wittgenstein's assertion, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental,\" underscores the elusive nature of ethics. I propose that this enigmatic aspect is, in fact, the most potent characteristic of both ethics and aesthetics, serving as a unifying thread between the two.\n\nThis profound connection is particularly evident in literature, where the intersection of art and morality is most pronounced. As McKean astutely notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality.\" While moral standards may be less relevant in other art forms, such as music, they seem to be an intrinsic aspect of literature, speaking to the very fabric of human existence. As McKean further remarks, \"Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern identity is marked by a unique blend of cultural influences, spanning from the Alpine foothills of southern Germany to the Baltic coast in Kiel. This cultural tapestry is woven together across various cities, including München, Köln, and Dresden, each with its distinct character shaped by its geographical location. Despite its contemporary unity, Germany's rich cultural heritage stems from a diverse array of historical sources and tribal influences.\n\nThe origins of the term \"Germania\" are shrouded in mystery, with scholars and historians offering various explanations. Tacitus, a Roman historian, suggested that the name might be derived from the Tungrian tribe, which was known to the Romans as \"Germans\" prior to their crossing of the Rhine River and their conflict with Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98 AD). In his Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Julius Caesar first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germanic tribes that remained beyond the Rhine. Caesar's use of the term was likely inspired by the Gauls themselves, who may have referred to their Germanic neighbors by this name. In his account of the Gallic Wars, Caesar notes that the Germans, who lived beyond the Rhine, were engaged in almost daily battles with the Gauls (Caesar, 50-40 BC).\n\nAlternative etymologies propose that the term \"German\" might be connected to the spear, known as a \"ger\" in Old English, or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which could imply that the Germans were known for their loud or boisterous nature. \n\nTacitus' work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" written in 98 AD, provides valuable insights into the early history of the Germanic peoples. In this treatise, Tacitus describes the Germans as an indigenous people, untouched by external influences through immigration or cultural exchange. He notes that those who would venture to Germany would have been drawn by its harsh climate, rugged terrain, and unique cultural landscape. While the Romans did engage in military campaigns in Germania, they generally did not settle there permanently, preferring to maintain a presence on the periphery of the Roman Empire. Instead, the Germanic tribes interacted with the Romans through trade and by serving in the Roman military, bringing their skills and goods to the Roman world (Ozment, 2005, p. 17).",
            "As I gazed down, my mind temporarily blanketed itself against the visual stimuli before me. I observed without emotional attachment or speculation, adopting an almost detached awareness of the scene unfolding before my eyes. My thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness at a pace that left little room for reflection. In this state, I seemed to exist solely as a conduit for the sensory information I was processing.\n\nI had long been fascinated with the idea of creating visual representations of the world, a curiosity that began when I was six years old. The discovery of 'The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' by an artist I had the opportunity to work with reignited this passion. This book delves into the fundamental principles of drawing, from understanding the basic tools to processing visual information. One technique that particularly resonated with me was the exercise of framing a subject with a square boundary, allowing the complex to be distilled into its most essential elements.\n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl in front of me, I was overwhelmed by the sheer intensity of the visual data. I failed to mentally impose the artist's frame, and my mind was flooded with the intricate details of the scene. I stood transfixed, my thoughts in a state of suspended animation.\n\nAs I reflect on the artistic process, I am reminded of the unique styles of masters like Picasso, Monet, and the Italian Renaissance artists. If I were to consider myself an artist, I would view this moment as the inception of my creative journey, the beginning of my artistic odyssey, titled 'Work in Brown'.\n\nI tentatively reached for my chosen medium, my hand instinctively guiding it through the air. My muscles tensed and relaxed as my hand connected with the object, giving shape and form to my creative expression. Water, serene and smooth, seemed to flow through my thoughts, and I felt a sense of calm wash over me. But then, my hand jerked back, and I found myself violently gripping the toilet handle once more. The stubborn brown package refused to budge, stuck fast like a slug on the toilet's surface.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, my feet shoulder-width apart, I frowned in distaste as I gazed at the unappealing remnants of human waste left behind for the janitorial staff to clean up. The need for a solution was clear, and with a few more deliberate movements, I managed to dislodge the offending item. With the crisis averted, I turned my attention to the wall to my right and grasped the sheet of toilet paper, began to unravel it, and eventually formed it into a makeshift mitt. Standing up straight, I then bent at the waist, and my hand slowly dipped into the bowl, much like a mother carefully placing a turkey into the oven on Thanksgiving Day.",
            "The alarming trend of youthful fatalities behind the wheel is a pressing concern in the United States. A multifaceted analysis reveals that a combination of factors contributes to this daunting statistic. Research from the National Institutes of Health indicates that the adolescent brain is not yet fully equipped to handle the complexities of driving, underscoring the significance of inexperience in this context. Novice drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents, as well as vehicle rollovers, speeding, and off-road incidents.\n\nA study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a noteworthy correlation between the age of passengers and the frequency of traffic accidents. It is a well-documented phenomenon that teenagers often engage in peer-driven activities, which only exacerbates the situation.\n\nTo address this issue, several states, including California, have implemented provisional driver's licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit underage passengers. However, this measure is merely a temporary solution, as the root problem lies in the inherent limitations of young drivers. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that the desire for risk-taking among adolescents, particularly those under the age of 20, is a significant factor in the high accident rate. This propensity for thrill-seeking makes it prudent to delay the issuance of full driver's licenses until this tendency has diminished.\n\nIf we continue to grant licenses to young teens, we can expect a significant increase in fatalities. With the Baby Boomer generation's offspring approaching driving age, the number of new teen drivers will surge, potentially leading to a staggering death toll in the coming years.\n\nLegislative action on this matter would be relatively straightforward. Schools could continue to provide driver's education courses as a precursor to obtaining a full license, while restricting access to motor vehicles for those under 18. A provisional permit could still be issued, accompanied by a set number of practical driving hours, which could be based on existing state requirements (e.g., California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice).\n\nGiven the nationwide scope of the issue, uniform federal legislation would be a logical and effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country. This proposal is not a novel concept, but rather a much-needed step towards mitigating the risks associated with teenage driving.",
            "During an investigation of the early cinematic archive at the Library of Congress, I opted to analyze the collection of trick films produced by Thomas Edison between 1895 and 1901. A total of fifteen films were examined, showcasing the creative use of editing techniques to craft illusions. My research primarily focused on dissecting the aesthetic principles governing trick films and identifying the anomalies evident in several later productions. Notably, these early trick films were largely confined to a static setting with a frontal presentation, adhering to a strict convention of stationary camera shots and adhering to a one-to-one shot ratio. However, a few pioneering films at the turn of the century deviated from these conventions, introducing novel elements such as multiple shot compositions.\n\nOne common thread among the trick films was their filming within a contained, proscenium-framed set. The camera remained fixed in its position, refraining from panning or following subjects. This visual approach drew inspiration from theatre and vaudeville traditions, as well as the aesthetics of magic performances. One limitation inherent in this format was that characters generally moved horizontally, never approaching or receding from the camera. A prime example can be seen in Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), where actors enter from the right side and traverse the stage, occasionally disappearing from view without the camera tracking their movement.\n\nThe proscenium-style composition also resulted in predominantly long and, occasionally, medium shots. Close-ups were entirely absent from the Edison catalog of trick films, echoing the conventions of live theatre and vaudeville, where the entire performance was presented within a framed space. As a result, characters rarely moved towards the camera, precluding the use of close-ups. The majority of trick films conformed to a pattern of one conceptual shot equating to one physical shot, which imposed a time constraint of approximately one minute or less, contingent on the frame rate. This linear narrative structure often confined trick films to short, vaudeville-inspired tricks, such as illusions, disappearances, and quick-change sequences with minimal storytelling. Notably, however, this apparent unity often belies a more complex construction, where a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple physical shots combined to create an illusion. The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), an early trick film, exemplifies this technique, where a closer examination reveals the onset of the physical shot depicting Mary's beheaded body, even though the entire film is perceived as a single shot.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the principles of Republicanism, which guided his views on governance and individual freedom. As an agriculturalist, he forged a unique perspective that blended his profession's emphasis on self-sufficiency with his limited experience in politics. This distinct blend of outlooks earned him a reputation as a steadfast champion of personal liberties and a vocal critic of government overreach.\n\nTaylor's agrarian ideals served as the foundation for his opinions on state sovereignty, constitutionalism, and the judiciary. He believed that a well-structured agrarian society was the key to a harmonious and thriving community, and that this ideal should be the guiding force behind government policy.\n\nThe notion that the United States had a clean slate, untainted by existing power structures, presented a remarkable opportunity to establish a truly self-governing system. Taylor firmly believed in the inherent value of natural rights, which he saw as interconnected and mutually dependent. He argued that the erosion of one right would imperil the entire system, thereby diminishing the worth of those remaining. Consequently, these rights should remain beyond the reach of government intervention.\n\nIn his vision for an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must balance the innate duality of human nature – encompassing both goodness and malevolence. His rigid adherence to a dualistic morality led him to conclude that governments, like their constituents, are inherently flawed. He famously observed, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., p. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that safeguard private property, promote agricultural prosperity, and harness the power of capitalism for the greater good. Conversely, a government founded on such principles would operate equitably, despite the inevitable presence of self-interest and avarice in its administration.\n\nTaylor's stance on self-interest was nuanced: while it was a fundamental driver of human action, it became pernicious only when it led to the exploitation of others. A responsible government, he believed, must acknowledge and manage the darker aspects of human nature to prevent the introduction of pernicious principles.\n\nSimilar to many other Republicans of his time, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, one that limited the federal government's authority to the powers explicitly granted to it. He recognized that an extensive federal government would be costly and prone to despotism, yet he cautioned that a literal interpretation devoid of context could prove equally hazardous. Moreover, he saw the Declaration of Independence as the true charter of the United States, as it more eloquently articulated the nation's status as a confederation of sovereign states.",
            "Upon examining the data presented in Figure 17, a notable decrease in commuter log submissions during the third month of the project is evident. This trend may be attributed to several factors. The onset of winter at a New England institution likely resulted in a reduction in biking and walking commutes. Furthermore, the conclusion of the fall semester, coupled with the subsequent holiday season, may have diverted individuals' attention away from the project. The typical December break also presents a challenge, as students and faculty often take time off during this period, potentially reducing the need for campus visits. Following the winter break, the resumption of classes in late January might have contributed to a brief uptick in activity. However, the relatively low number of submissions in February remains a puzzle. It is also possible that the initial enthusiasm for the project naturally waned over time, a phenomenon that can be mitigated through targeted initiatives. \n\nTo counteract this decline, the Carpool Challenge Week campaign was implemented in March, yielding a significant increase in log submissions for that month. This experience highlights the importance of maintaining momentum and addressing the unique challenges posed by academic breaks. Additionally, the project's reliance on alternative modes of transportation is hindered by cultural preferences for personal transportation. To overcome this obstacle, incentives such as gift certificates to local businesses were provided. While these proved effective, it would be intriguing to explore the impact of more substantial prizes, including eco-friendly vehicles, on participation levels. Adjusting the value and variety of incentives throughout the project's duration may have helped sustain engagement and prevent the observed dip in activity. For instance, announcing additional prizes, such as bicycles or hybrid/electric cars, during the winter break or at the beginning of the spring semester, could have potentially boosted participation and enthusiasm.",
            "The investment landscape is home to a variety of financial instruments, among which exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer a unique blend of characteristics. By tracking an index, commodity, or a curated basket of assets, ETFs strike a balance between the diversification of index funds and the flexibility of individual stock ownership. This hybrid model allows for the benefits of short selling, margin buying, and the purchase of minimal shares in any transaction, often at a lower expense ratio compared to the average mutual fund. However, investors should be aware that ETF trading incurs commission fees, similar to those associated with stock transactions. Moreover, the availability of numerous ETF options can be a double-edged sword, as it may lead to information overload and decision paralysis.\n\nIn this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF and scrutinize its top 10 holdings, which collectively comprise 63.58% of the fund's assets. By examining the constituent stocks, we can assess whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to those of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. Additionally, we will investigate whether a tailored configuration of these stocks could potentially yield a more optimal risk-return profile.\n\nTo streamline our analysis, we will concentrate on the top 10 holdings, which account for a significant proportion of the ETF's assets. By normalizing the current percentage of assets to 100%, we can estimate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's beta and return, assuming the portfolio is comprised entirely of these 10 stocks in the same proportions as the ETF. The accompanying chart provides the calculated values for beta and return.\n\nA cursory examination of the data reveals that a portfolio consisting only of the top 10 holdings would yield a return approximately 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase. Conversely, the beta of this portfolio is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole. These findings suggest that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings might offer a more advantageous risk-return profile. Nevertheless, it is crucial to verify whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo determine the statistical significance of these findings, we will calculate the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks and normalize it to 100% for comparison with the ETF IHF. This will enable us to assess whether the accumulated volatility of the top 10 holdings is meaningfully different from that of the ETF.",
            "In a notable work, Poe has demonstrated mastery of the poetic craft. His poem \"Dream-Land\" showcases his ability to weave together disparate elements in a rich tapestry of sound and symbolism. Notably, in lines 6 and 56, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" a reference that can be traced back to the Roman poet Virgil. However, a more nuanced understanding of this allusion is warranted. While Virgil's use of the term is well-documented, it is also indebted to a more recent literary influence. Poe's fascination with German literature is well-documented, and his exposure to the works of Goethe would have been a significant factor in shaping his writing.\n\nA key aspect of Poe's relationship with Goethe is highlighted by the similarity between their respective poems. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" observes that Poe's work exhibits a clear debt to Goethe's style. This observation is reinforced by the fact that Goethe's magnum opus, the poetic drama \"Faust,\" was widely disseminated in the early 19th century. The second part of this work, published in 1832, contains a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé,\" which tells the story of a king who, following the death of his wife, succumbs to despair and ultimately takes his own life.\n\nThe parallels between the King of Thulé and the speaker of \"Dream-Land\" are striking. Both characters are haunted by loss and driven to the brink of madness by their circumstances. The King's descent into darkness and despair serves as a poignant commentary on the human condition, one that Poe likely drew upon in his own work. The fact that both poems share a similar thematic preoccupation with the abyss of human suffering suggests a deep engagement with Goethe's ideas.\n\nPoe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and \"Dream-Land\" serves as a testament to the interconnectedness of his oeuvre. In both poems, the term functions as a bookend, framing the speaker's journey into the unknown. The landscape of Thulé, with its dark and lonely expanse, serves as a bleak counterpoint to the vibrant world of the speaker's imagination. This dichotomy is echoed in \"The King of Thulé,\" where the king's descent into madness is precipitated by his loss and isolation.\n\nGoethe's influence on Poe's work is also evident in his admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Poe's respect for Tennyson, a fellow poet of great renown, would have likely exposed him to Goethe's work. Furthermore, the widespread dissemination of Goethe's writings in the early 19th century would have ensured that his ideas and themes were widely available to poets like Poe.",
            "A shopper who tripped and fell on a puddle of applesauce in a grocery store might potentially be awarded punitive damages if the store manager's actions were deemed reckless and intentional, given that he was informed twice of the spill but failed to clean it up for a half-hour because he was taking a break to eat dinner.\n\nA court is unlikely to entirely dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To be eligible for punitive damages, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant's actions were taken with a deliberate and conscious disregard for the potential harm that could result, as well as show that the conduct was reprehensible. Palmer will likely argue that Paul Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the potential harm of not cleaning the spill, given that multiple customers had already slipped and fallen in the store in the months leading up to her accident. Furthermore, despite this knowledge, he still failed to take action to address the spill. Palmer's assertion that Martin's actions were reprehensible might not be as persuasive, but it is still a valid argument, considering the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin failed to take adequate measures to ensure the safety of his store.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, an employee of D&D Markets, alerted his manager, Paul Martin, to an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on a break and unable to address the issue at that time. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, but he responded in the same manner. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are considering whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment on the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising from a contract if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California Civil Code Section 3294(a) defines malice as conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and committed with a \"willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.\" Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when it involves a conscious disregard of a plaintiff's rights when the defendant is aware of the probable consequences of their actions and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.

            "My interest in Islam was initially sparked by a college course I took about four years ago at the CBC.  The class engaged in a lively discussion about the nature of Islam, with some students questioning whether it's inherently a hostile religion.  As I reflect on the intervening years, I've observed a shift in the media's portrayal of Islam in the United States, moving from a predominantly negative to a more tolerant perspective.  This transformation is particularly striking when considering the candidacy of Barack Obama, whose family background includes Muslim heritage, and who rose to prominence in the early 2000s.\n\nThe life of the Prophet Muhammad is a subject that fascinates me.  Learning more about his biography has led me to reevaluate my initial understanding of his character.  I was under the impression that Muhammad was a figure who coerced conversions and expanded his influence through conquest.  However, the biography paints a different picture – one of a humble individual who embodied a sense of self-awareness and compassion.  According to the narrative, people were drawn to his teachings as they came to appreciate his message and character.\n\nInterestingly, I've noticed parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying food to feed a group of men.  This style of storytelling may suggest that the authors aimed to portray Muhammad as a humble figure who didn't need to prove himself, but rather allowed his message and actions to speak for themselves.  I find this approach problematic, as it downplays the significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nThe biography also includes anecdotes that appear to serve as testimony to the validity of Muhammad's message.  These accounts often originate from secondary sources, making it challenging to verify their accuracy.  While the intention behind these stories may have been to provide evidence, I felt they diminished the authenticity of the narrative and made it harder to discern fact from fiction.\n\nWhat I find most unsettling about this work is its attempt to depict Muhammad as an exemplary figure, emphasizing his humility, kindness, and wisdom.  However, historical records raise questions about the accuracy of this portrayal.  I'm left wondering whether contemporary Muslims are aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "A thread of divergence can be observed in the Christian narrative as it evolved beyond the life of Jesus.  If we examine the trajectory of Christian thought, we notice a gradual drift from its foundational roots.  The trajectory suggests an increasing awareness of history and a growing inclination towards progressive ideas.  While traditionalists remain steadfast in their convictions, their influence may not be sufficient to sway the broader movement.  As the years unfold, a heightened awareness of historical context is likely to emerge.  There will be a growing desire to distinguish between the accumulated doctrines of Christianity and the original intent of its namesake.  This process may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome is inevitable:  the trend in Christian history will reverse, leading to a return to the original form.  A movement will gain momentum, stripping away layers of dogma, much like a reversal of time, until only the essence of Jesus' teachings remains.  As this shift gains traction in the United States and Europe, it will spread, influencing the masses to adopt a more authentic, Jesus-centric approach to faith.  The institutional church will continue to play a guiding role, but the theological landscape will undergo a significant transformation.  The proliferation of diversity within Christendom will give way to increasing uniformity of belief and practice.  Regional and denominational differences will diminish, replaced by a growing sense of shared understanding.  History is replete with examples of reversals, such as the Roman Empire's transition from persecution to Christian dominance, and the transformation of the United States from a society that enslaved to one that empowered African Americans.  A similar reversal is imminent in the Christian faith, one that will seek to reclaim the origins of the religion and reduce diversity in the process.  A key factor in this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus' words as metaphorical rather than literal.  If we look back in time, we find the theological underpinnings of Christianity rooted in Judaism.  By the time the Romans seized control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., the Jewish faith had already developed a strong foundation, centered on monotheism, divine revelation, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures.  The Jewish population was not homogeneous, with various sects like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the common people each holding distinct beliefs and practices.",
            "One of the underlying themes in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle is the inherent self-interest and callousness of individuals when it comes to the well-being of others. This is exemplified by the factory owners and managers who prioritize their own success and the growth of their businesses above all else, disregarding the potential consequences for the environment and their employees. The vivid description of the factories, as seen in the passage, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world,\" effectively captures the devastating impact of industrialization on the environment and the community. Sinclair highlights the owners' disregard for the harm caused by pollution and the poor conditions surrounding the factories, such as the animal waste and runoff from the pens.\n\nFurthermore, Sinclair illustrates the exploitative nature of the factory owners and managers through their treatment of employees. They are willing to push their workers to their limits, forcing them to work long hours without adequate compensation or concern for their well-being. The quote \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\" effectively conveys the toxic atmosphere of the factories. The lack of regulation and safety measures during the time period allowed the owners to take advantage of their employees, often laying them off without warning or support.\n\nThe novel portrays the workers as being trapped in a system with limited options for escape. They were often forced to live in squalid conditions and work in hazardous environments, with no access to resources or support to improve their situation. The formation of unions, often seen as a means of empowerment for workers, was instead exploited by those in power, further entrenching the problems faced by the working class. The comparison to slavery, as seen in the statement \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers\" is a powerful indictment of the system and the treatment of workers during this time.",
            "In the realm of literary technique, authors often employ various methods to elicit a specific emotional response from their readers. While some methods prove more effective than others, F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of techniques in his novel, The Great Gatsby. One such approach involves juxtaposing an adjective with a noun in an unconventional manner to create a particular aura around a subject. Alternatively, Fitzgerald assigns meaning to a symbol, which he later leverages to evoke a particular emotional response.\n\nFitzgerald's use of symbolism, particularly with regards to colors, is a prime example of this technique. In The Great Gatsby, he establishes a rich tapestry of meanings surrounding several hues, including white, gray, and the reddish-pink spectrum. By consistently associating these colors with specific emotions and connotations, Fitzgerald crafts a nuanced narrative that resonates with readers. In the novel, Fitzgerald skillfully employs the symbolism of white and gray to convey the themes of uniformity, exclusivity, and the passage of time.\n\nThroughout the novel, Fitzgerald sets the tone for these colors by repeatedly depicting them in everyday contexts. Characters such as Daisy and Jordan are frequently clad in white, while Nick dons white flannels to Gatsby's party. Even the narrator's descriptions of the cityscape and social gatherings reinforce this association, as evidenced by the \"gaudy primary colors\" that pervade Gatsby's party. By assigning these colors to mundane subjects, Fitzgerald reinforces their significance and establishes a sense of unity. This becomes particularly evident in Nick's descriptions of his daily commute and the \"uniform\" facades of apartment buildings.\n\nHowever, Fitzgerald also employs these colors to convey a sense of uniformity and monotony, particularly in relation to Daisy. After establishing the symbolic meaning of white and gray, he begins to associate them with Daisy's character, depicting her as a uniform, almost interchangeable part of Gatsby's world. Her appearance in a \"little white roadster\" serves as a turning point, where readers begin to perceive her as a mere accessory, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. This technique is further reinforced by other instances, such as the \"gray haze\" surrounding her fur collar and her repeated appearances in white dresses.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural industry thrives due to the region's pleasant, sunny climate. The local agricultural scene encompasses a diverse array of crops, including but not limited to tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, and tree fruits such as peaches and lemons, as well as berries, honey, and peppers. The demand for locally produced, organic community-supported agriculture products is substantial, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand. Many organic farms in the area offer tours of their operations, as well as opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. Such sustainable agricultural endeavors allow landowners to capitalize on government programs while fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between land use and habitat conservation, thereby creating opportunities for educational programs, farm tours, and revenue generation.\n\nIn addition to addressing a potentially lucrative market niche, organic farming often yields numerous ecological benefits, including increased biodiversity in local plant and animal species due to the absence of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in the soil and water. Nevertheless, organic farming comes with some drawbacks. It typically demands more manual labor and specialized management to control pests and weeds and to maintain soil health without synthetic chemicals. Losses can be higher than those experienced with conventional farming methods, and small-scale organic farms often face operational inefficiencies compared to larger operations. Furthermore, other beneficial land management practices unrelated to organic farming, such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, removing invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats or open spaces, can also incur greater labor costs.\n\nThe specific parcel chosen for this scenario is situated near the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California, and encompasses 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest. This land is located within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, which currently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals, including several endangered species such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, and the California gnatcatcher, as well as species that are declining and may soon be listed as endangered, such as the burrowing owl.\n\nHistorically, this area was inhabited by Native American communities for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood vendors in the late 19th century. The land in question was part of a historic homestead patent and likely served as a grazing area and/or a woodlot for many decades.\n\nTo illustrate the potential challenges and opportunities for a small farmer operating in this region, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched relevant government programs that could help mitigate costs and support wildlife-friendly agricultural practices. I then identified an organic farm in the same area to serve as a model for a hypothetical farm operation.",
            "The dynamics of cultural influence are profound in the negotiation process. However, it's essential to acknowledge that culture can be multifaceted and far-reaching, encompassing not only what it represents but also what it omits. A culture's characteristics cannot be distilled into a single, monolithic entity. Stereotypical assertions such as \"Russians are stubborn\" or \"the Japanese are accommodating\" oversimplify the complexities of cultural identity. While general understandings can provide a foundation, it's more productive for negotiators to delve deeper into the nuances of a culture's significance and how it impacts the negotiation. By contextualizing a culture's influence within the specific context of the negotiation, one can better navigate potential challenges.\n\nEngaging with a foreign culture requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing aspects such as historical context, societal norms, and inherent biases. Rather than judging or attempting to alter a culture, it's crucial to accept and respect its distinctiveness, particularly in high-stakes negotiations where power dynamics are at play. In foreign territories, embracing local customs and traditions can facilitate smoother negotiations and foster a more collaborative environment.\n\nIt's worth noting that cultural identity extends beyond national or international boundaries. Corporate cultures within a nation can be just as distinct as national cultures. For example, organizational cultures may prioritize long working hours or a more relaxed work-life balance. Observable signs of a corporate culture include dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. The varying approaches to philanthropy among companies – some encouraging individual initiative, while others restrict it to approved channels – illustrate the diversity of thought within a societal culture. Even within the United States, company cultures can differ significantly, with regional and urban-rural variations adding to the complexity. A uniform exterior can belie a rich tapestry of values and practices waiting to be explored.\n\nUnderstanding values is essential, as they provide the underlying motivations that drive cultural behavior. In cultures where saving face or communal harmony are paramount, a negotiator will likely avoid public embarrassment or conflict to achieve a successful outcome. Conversely, in cultures that prioritize hard-driving negotiations, settlement at the earliest opportunity may not be the primary goal. By considering these general characteristics, negotiators can better prepare for the negotiation table. Nevertheless, gaining insight into an opponent's personal values can significantly enhance the negotiation's effectiveness.",
            "In a foundational passage of the Christian Bible, Psalm 14, a profound notion is articulated: \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God.'\" This passage serves as the starting point for the philosophical inquiry of St. Anselm, who also grapples with the concept of the divine in his own work. Interestingly, Thomas Aquinas, another prominent thinker, shares similarities with Anselm in his arguments for the existence of a higher power. Given that both authors are advocating for the same theological position, it is essential to acknowledge, for the sake of comparison, that they are both operating within the framework of a monotheistic deity – one that aligns with the traditional understanding of the Christian God. By assuming this common ground, we can effectively examine their arguments without introducing variables that might skew the comparison. Nevertheless, I would contend that, despite the merits of each author's reasoning, neither provides a comprehensive foundation for belief in the divine.\n\nTo illustrate this point, let's consider Anselm's central argument. His philosophical approach involves a introspective exploration of the human mind, seeking to uncover evidence of the divine within oneself. Anselm argues that the concept of God's existence is inherent to our understanding, and therefore, we cannot negate it. This idea, while articulated in Anselm's unique terminology, essentially suggests that the proof for God lies in the depths of our own consciousness. He posits that an individual need not rely on external validation, as the truth of God's existence is self-evident within the human mind. This perspective is rooted in the notion of faith, which, within Christian theology, refers to the acceptance of truths that transcend empirical verification.\n\nIn stark contrast, Thomas Aquinas presents a reasoning that relies exclusively on logical and empirical evidence, eliminating the need for faith altogether. This approach has significant implications for the practice of evangelism in Christianity, as it would enable the conversion of new adherents without relying on their willingness to accept the unknowable. Aquinas develops five distinct rational arguments – involving change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony – to demonstrate the logical necessity of God's existence. Each argument presents a compelling case for the existence of a higher power, one that can be discerned through the logical assembly of observable phenomena. By examining the characteristics of a puzzle, we can infer the presence of a missing piece, even if we have not directly observed it.",
            "Emerging in the distant past, circa the 5th or 6th century BCE, an individual destined for greatness would come to be known as the Buddha. As the years unfolded, he would renounce worldly life and attain profound enlightenment, laying the groundwork for Buddhism—a faith that has evolved significantly over the centuries. Approximately 2,500 years have elapsed since its inception, and its current manifestations bear little resemblance to the original teachings. This phenomenon can be observed in various forms, such as in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. This celebration, while devoid of direct scriptural endorsement, serves as a testament to the dynamic nature of the faith. From the most superficial customs to the fundamental principles of the religion, the Theravada Buddhist community has undergone transformations both from internal and external influences, some benevolent and others hostile.\n\nA critical understanding of the subject necessitates the clarification of certain key terms. The dichotomy between internal and external forces will be a recurring theme in this discussion. An internal force refers to a change originating from within the Buddhist community, irrespective of monastic status. Conversely, an external force denotes any influence exerted by non-Buddhists. A hostile force is characterized by its intent to harm or undermine the Buddhist community, often stemming from a negative perception of the faith. In contrast, a benign force is one that neither actively seeks to harm nor assist the community, though its consequences may vary.\n\nTo establish a solid foundation for this analysis, it is essential to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism. The core principles of the faith revolve around the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma, comprising the Tripitaka, is the collection of sacred texts that form the basis of Buddhist thought. The Tripitaka consists of three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, containing the Suttas; the Vinaya Pitaka, outlining the disciplinary rules; and the Abhidhamma Pitaka, encompassing the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. Central to these notions are the concepts of Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (the impermanence of all phenomena). The recognition of these principles is crucial for transcending the cycle of death and rebirth, known as Sansara, and for ultimately overcoming the afflictions of lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) that accompany enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka provides guidelines for laymen, including the five precepts: refraining from harming, lying, stealing, causing harm through illicit behavior, and consuming intoxicating substances. Monks, on the other hand, are subject to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. At the heart of Buddhist doctrine lies the Four Noble Truths: 1) the existence of Dukkha; 2) the role of attachment in perpetuating suffering; and 3) the possibility of overcoming suffering.",
            "Bilateral tensions between the United States and Mexico exemplify a long-standing rivalry that persisted for over five decades. From 1836 to 1893, the two nations engaged in a series of confrontations that would eventually subside before the onset of World War I (Diehl and Goerts 2000, p. 145). The conflict reached its zenith during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, which saw the United States secure Texas and the American Southwest as new territories following a decisive victory over Mexico. The rivalry's trajectory was marked by recurring clashes, including territorial disputes, cultural differences, and competing interests (Schmitt 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis phenomenon is not unique to the US-Mexico relationship. Neighboring countries often experience rivalries stemming from conflicting interests, cultural disparities, and historical animosities. The United States and Mexico are situated in a comparable context, with David M. Pletcher (1977) noting that Mexico and Cuba are the only two nations that have posed long-standing diplomatic challenges for the United States (p. 41). Both countries' geographical proximity to the US has contributed to their rivalry, whereas other Latin American nations have generally enjoyed more cordial relationships with the US.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations, a recurring theme in international conflicts throughout history (Frahm 2001, p. 86). The ideological underpinnings of the rivalry were rooted in the US's historical opposition to Catholicism and monarchy, which was inherited from the English and Spanish colonial powers. This legacy of mistrust hindered the establishment of a harmonious foreign relationship between the US and Mexico.\n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 instances of disputes between the US and Mexico during the 57-year period of rivalry, with the majority of these incidents revolving around territorial issues, including border raids and frontier problems (p. 145). The presence of bandits and outlaws from American border towns posed a significant challenge, which was eventually mitigated through joint military efforts by both nations (Schmitt 1974, p. 97).\n\nThe rivalry between the US and Mexico began to subside as Mexico's economic dependence on the US increased (Schmitt 1974, p. 109), and eventually dissipated as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico (p. 110) in the late 19th century.",
            "It has been a monumental fifteen years since I was suddenly struck down by an illness that shook the very foundations of my existence. I was a nurse at the time, having chosen my profession as a means of securing a sense of stability and comfort that had long eluded me during my tumultuous childhood. The notion that I would always have a steady means of income proved to be a comforting mantra, one that led me to forgo my initial aspirations of becoming a scientist or journalist, opting instead for the relative security of a traditional nursing career.\n\nHowever, life had other plans. At the age of 46, I found myself single, financially strained, and unable to work. The years that followed have been a grueling struggle, with Social Security Disability serving as my primary lifeline. Despite my resilience, each day presents a daunting challenge to my well-being, self-esteem, and sense of security. The uncertainty that pervades my life is a harsh reality, one that I have come to accept.\n\nYet, amidst this turmoil, there is one constant that has sustained me: the unwavering support of my loved ones and a handful of close friends. These individuals have been my rock, providing a sense of security and stability that I thought I had left behind. Their selflessness has taught me that true strength lies not in individual resilience, but in the bonds we form with others.\n\nMy experience has instilled in me a profound appreciation for the importance of community and mutual support. In a world where uncertainty is an ever-present reality, it is essential that we learn to rely on one another, to trust in the goodness of those around us. This is a lesson that our nation would do well to remember, particularly in the face of adversity.\n\nWhile it is wise to be prepared for the unexpected, I firmly believe that our society's emphasis on rugged individualism is misguided. The pioneers who settled our great nation did not succeed through self-reliance alone; it was their ability to come together, to share resources and offer support that ultimately led them to their destinations.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, I have taken steps to ensure my preparedness for potential emergencies. I possess a well-stocked disaster kit, complete with essential supplies and a plan for self-sufficiency. However, I firmly believe that the most critical component of any disaster plan is the relationships we nurture with those around us. By fostering a sense of community and trust, we can create a network of support that will see us through even the most trying times.\n\nIn a world where uncertainty reigns, it is essential that we recognize the value of interdependence. By embracing this concept, we can build stronger, more resilient communities that are better equipped to weather the storms of life. So, let us not merely focus on individual preparedness, but also on cultivating the relationships that will ultimately be our greatest source of strength.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a subject of ongoing inquiry. While D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that biologists struggle to define even the simplest organic forms in mathematical terms still resonates today, recent advances in mathematical modeling have expanded our understanding of mollusk development. Specifically, researchers have applied statistical models to the development and evolution of shell morphology in mollusks, as exemplified by the work of Raup and Stanley (1981).\n\nOur study aims to investigate the role of mathematical modeling in elucidating the mechanisms governing evolutionary-developmental change in the genus Prunum. By combining mathematical modeling with experimental and descriptive studies, we seek to better comprehend the constraints that shape the direction and magnitude of evolutionary change. To achieve this, we employed X-radiographic imaging of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that can be used to model hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. These parameters were then incorporated into the CerioShell software program (Stone, 1995) to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change.\n\nThe shell of a mollusk can be conceptualized as a spiral structure that traverses a three-dimensional space over time, comprising a series of whorls that spiral around an imaginary central axis, the columella. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, and each whorl is separated from the next by a continuous line, or suture. In most shells, the final whorl, or body whorl, is the largest, while the spire consists of all whorls except the final one. The apex and base of the shell are defined by the tip of the spire and the opposite end, respectively, and the animal exits through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives, including apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views, with the conventional orientation being apertural, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards.\n\nTo count whorls, one should first observe the shell from the apical view and determine the starting point of the first suture. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two parts, and whorls can be counted from this line, with estimates made to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nBy tracing the path of the aperture through time and space as the animal constructs its shell, it is possible to represent the shell's development graphically and mathematically. This enables the formulation of a mathematical model, which can then be used to investigate the effects of varying parameters on the mollusk's skeletogenesis.",
            "The stagnation of neonatal and infant mortality rates in Indonesia over the past decade stands in stark contrast to the country's progress in achieving other Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets.  Despite this, the slow pace of improvement in child and maternal health indicators suggests that additional efforts are necessary to meet the 2015 targets.  A closer examination of the factors contributing to these sluggish advancements reveals a pressing need to bolster the country's overall health infrastructure, rather than solely focusing on targeted programs.\n\nIndonesia has made strides in increasing the proportion of births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% currently meeting this benchmark.  However, this metric includes traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the medical expertise to respond to complications during pregnancy, resulting in a disproportionate number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhaging.  Consequently, the apparent progress in this area is somewhat deceptive, and further work is required to address the underlying issues.  Moreover, a notable decline in the number of children under five treated by a health professional for diarrheal diseases is a cause for concern.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, the current rates across the country are alarmingly low.\n\nThe cesarean-section rate in Indonesia remains below the expected threshold, at approximately 4%.  This figure is particularly striking in light of the considerable disparity between urban and rural areas, with cesarean rates of 7% in urban settings and a paltry 2% in rural regions.  This stark contrast highlights the unequal distribution of healthcare services, with a clear bias towards urban areas.  Furthermore, the significant gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest quintiles, amounting to 27%, underscores the issue of vertical equity.  The poor are disproportionately hindered in accessing healthcare services, largely due to the financial burden of out-of-pocket costs.\n\nIn charting a course for improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the fundamental question arises: how to most effectively address the dearth of services.  Specifically, should Indonesia adopt targeted programmatic approaches or prioritize strengthening its overall health system, without compromising on pre and post-pregnancy care for mothers and infants.  While program-specific initiatives may offer a tempting solution, they come with significant drawbacks.  One major concern is that investing heavily in a particular area can divert resources away from other vital sectors, leading to a brain drain of skilled personnel towards more resource-rich areas, as seen in the case of the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on the family planning sector.  Moreover, the proliferation of parallel programs for a single area can result in duplication of services, inefficiencies, and an overwhelming burden of paperwork and administrative tasks.",
            "The Victorian era is marked by its fastidious attention to minute particulars and its preoccupation with the upper echelons of society.  However, two novels that diverge from this norm are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights, both of which incorporate elements of enigma and a penchant for the unconventional, characteristics that deviate from the standard expectations of the period. These unconventional aspects serve to heighten the depth of character within each narrative, providing a more nuanced understanding of their motivations and emotional landscapes.\n\nIn Oliver Twist, for instance, the protagonist's inner turmoil is underscored by vivid and unsettling visions that blur the lines between reality and fantasy. A telling example of this is evident in the following passage from the novel, where the protagonist's thoughts are consumed by a maelstrom of disorienting ideas:\n\n\"As he walked, the din of argument between Sikes and Crackit receded into the background, their words echoing in his mind. But when he focused his attention, he found himself locked in a heated conversation with them. Sudden gunfire shattered the air, and a cacophony of cries and shouts erupted around him. He felt an unseen force propelling him through the chaos, as his senses reeled from the proximity of pain.\"\n\nThis technique is often employed through the use of dream sequences or dreamlike states in both novels, though the specific purpose and execution differ in each. In Oliver Twist, such visions frequently offer insights into Oliver's inner world, revealing the depths of his emotional pain and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of Oliver's shooting in chapter 28 is a poignant example of this, where the traumatic event is relived in vivid detail, underscoring the protagonist's lack of agency in the face of adversity. The passage highlights Oliver's disorientation and despair, as his senses are overwhelmed by the shock of pain, which has become a constant and debilitating presence in his life.\n\nThe question of culpability for Oliver's misfortune is thus raised, as it is clear that his fate is not entirely his own. The passage implies a sense of powerlessness on Oliver's part, as if he is unable to exert control over the events unfolding around him, even when his very life is at stake. Furthermore, the narrative suggests a growing sense of resignation in Oliver, as if he has been worn down by the relentless pressures of his circumstances, rendering him increasingly unable to resist or react to his environment.\n\nIn this same vein, another passage from the novel captures the disorienting quality of time, where the protagonist's perceptions of day and night are distorted:\n\n\"The day had passed – or rather, it had not. Time seemed to be in a state of flux, with day and night blurring into one another in an endless cycle of darkness and light.\"",
            "My experience as an after-school program tutor for elementary students has given me a unique perspective on the challenges of language barriers in education, particularly in California. I recall a particular case that still resonates with me – a student named Adrian, who was experiencing reading difficulties despite speaking perfect English. What struck me was the irregularity of his reading struggles, which hinted at an underlying issue. As it turned out, Adrian was familiar with the English language but lacked a solid grasp of the alphabet and pronunciation. This experience has stuck with me, and I've come to realize that even native English speakers can face substantial obstacles when it comes to reading.\n\nThis experience serves as a testament to the complexities of addressing language barriers in schools. It's not always immediately apparent, even in students who seem to have a strong command of the language. In Adrian's case, targeted English reading instruction, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation, proved effective. However, for students with limited English proficiency, the solution is far more intricate. There's no one-size-fits-all approach; a combination of strategies is necessary.\n\nOne potential solution is the dual language education system. Research has shown that students participating in two-way bilingual programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about resource allocation and limited benefits, the benefits of these programs extend to all students, not just those with Spanish as their first language. By implementing these programs as the norm rather than the exception, we can unlock academic success for all students.\n\nTo make this a reality, we don't need to require every teacher to be bilingual. That would be impractical and unrealistic. Instead, we can utilize bilingual support staff, such as tutors or instructional aids, to complement the instruction. This approach would allow us to provide students with the support they need to succeed, regardless of their linguistic background. By combining effective teaching methods, bilingual support, and a commitment to inclusivity, we can create a more equitable educational environment for all students.",
            "The notion that there exists something greater than ourselves has been an enduring theme in human perception from an early age. This concept is often explored through various forms of spiritual inquiry, whether it's a Sunday school education, a temple visit, or introspective contemplation. Many adhere to the faith passed down from their ancestors, while others reject it altogether, convinced that their personal universe is the only truth. People frequently oscillate between different value systems as they navigate their own spiritual journeys. Ultimately, we are all searching for a guiding light to illuminate our path, dispelling the shadows that surround us.\n\nI recall a conversation with my father, who shared with me his fondness for cardinals. We sat on our porch, listening to the rain pelt against the roof, the sound muffled by the tin exterior. The downspouts funneled the rain onto the plants, drowning them in a small, desolate pool. He gazed out into the rain, his eyes a mixture of introspection and reminiscence. His appearance had changed – his hair thinned, his clothes hung loosely from his frame. I sensed a deep sadness emanating from him, and our conversation was tinged with an unspoken awareness that this might be our last moment together. I chose not to confront the impending reality, instead opting to share a moment of quiet companionship with him.\n\nMy father's battle with illness ended just five days after my 22nd birthday in December. The treatments had prolonged his life, but at what cost, I couldn't fathom. I wondered about the nature of a benevolent deity, one that would allow such suffering. That night, I chose not to pray, and instead, I questioned the existence of a higher power that seemed indifferent to my pleas.\n\nI had decided not to witness his passing, unable to bear the thought of watching the person who brought me into this world slip away. I opted to remember my father through the memories of his life, rather than the circumstances of his death. I knew him better than others, and I believed he would have preferred it that way. For three days, I stayed hidden in my bed, waiting for news that would confirm the inevitable.\n\nThe silence that followed was deafening.",
            "The Gothic Novel, a genre often perceived as an incongruous blend of the old and the new, was, as Ian Watt astutely observed, 'the epitome of dualities,' where anachronistic elements commingled with modern literary sensibilities. Since its inception, the Gothic genre has been subject to a wide range of reactions, from scathing criticism to effusive praise, with some dismissing it as a shallow exercise in sensationalism, while others extolled its capacity to evoke a sense of 'the terrible sublime' (Burke). The pioneering work, Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, drew upon the rich tapestry of medieval romances and modern novelistic conventions to create a new literary paradigm. By juxtaposing antiquated theatrical elements with the nascent novel's capacity for psychological insight, Walpole initiated a genre that would endure through the ages, paradoxically, both antiquated and innovative in its appeal.\n\nThe Gothic genre's affinity for medieval motifs, derived from theatre, architecture, and tradition, added to its aura of mystique. At the time of The Castle of Otranto's publication, the term 'Gothic' was employed to describe a range of disparate cultural and artistic movements, often connoting an air of antiquity or rustic simplicity in the face of modernity's triumphant march. The confluence of the theatrical and the novelistic, with its capacity to convey the inner lives of characters, helped to ensure the Gothic genre's longevity, rendering it simultaneously a relic of the past and a fresh, exciting discovery for readers from different eras.\n\nOne of the most enduring Gothic concepts is the ideal of chivalry, a medieval notion that underwent significant transformations in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry's emphasis on the virtuous knight, epitomized by bravery, honor, and competence, resonated deeply with Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, who lamented the decline of this ideal in his own society. By invoking the chivalric code, Gothic authors created a sanitized, romanticized representation of the past, which would eventually influence the development of Romanticism. In The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's character Frederic embodies this ideal, as described in the following passage:\n\nFrederic, a prince of noble lineage, has suffered the slings of fate and emerged scarred, his character tempered by adversity. His gallant and courteous demeanor, although exaggerated for effect, introduces the theme of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre. This image of the 'gallant and courteous Knight' prefigures the trope of the overwrought, which would come to characterize the genre.",
            "The logistical orchestration of goods, from initial raw materials to final customer delivery, encompasses the multifaceted processes of supply chain management. This concept, first coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, involves strategically planning, implementing, and controlling the entire sequence to meet customer demands efficiently. The six core components of a supply chain are production, supply, inventory management, geographical positioning, transportation, and data integration.\n\nEffective supply chain management relies on a thorough understanding of these components. Production forms the foundational stage of the process, where manufacturers outline the production timeline, including the 'when,' 'why,' 'where,' and 'how' of production. To inform these decisions, managers must first analyze market trends and customer preferences. By considering the market's pulse, manufacturers can determine the most sought-after products and quantities to produce. This market-driven approach enables managers to allocate production resources efficiently and maximize customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce the production plan is established, the next step is to decide on the production location and facility, taking into account factors such as volume, quality, and customer demand. Scheduling workloads and maintaining equipment is also crucial to ensuring a smooth production process. Every detail, no matter how seemingly minor, plays a vital role in the supply chain's success, as inconsistencies can lead to significant losses in time and resources in the long run. For instance, retailers like Wal-Mart and Target employ detailed blueprints and protocols for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, to minimize confusion and ensure seamless execution.\n\nSupply, the second critical element in supply chain management, involves making strategic decisions regarding a company's core capabilities and outsourcing partnerships. This may involve identifying the optimal internal divisions for various production processes or deciding to outsource specific tasks to external companies. The primary motivation for outsourcing is to achieve velocity – the ability to deliver high-quality products while minimizing costs and maintaining flexibility. By leveraging these strategic choices, companies can optimize their supply chain operations and stay competitive in the market.",
            "In a striking visual statement, Ellen Page, known for her role in the film Juno, holds a sign with a provocative message in her hand in Burma, a Southeast Asian nation currently governed by a military junta that seized power in 1962. The sign, scribbled with a Sharpie, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" Burma, officially known as Myanmar, has a complex and tumultuous history marked by periods of authoritarian rule and public protests. In 2007, a wave of street protests, dubbed the Saffron Revolution, swept the country after a decade of relative calm. Led by a large number of Buddhist monks, the protests drew international attention, albeit briefly, before escalating into violence, with reports of military crackdowns and ransacking of monasteries. Foreign journalists were detained and imprisoned, and a Japanese photojournalist, Kenji Nagai, was tragically killed while covering a protest in September 2007. Officially, 13 deaths were reported, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the military, estimated that the true toll was much higher, with thousands of bodies left uncounted.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident. The desire of governments to suppress dissent and maintain control over their populations is a recurring theme throughout history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine authority to govern, while Japanese emperors were believed to be gods, sent to guide their people. In modern times, the actions of leaders have been no less concerning. The Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, for instance, saw intellectuals, activists, and students gather in Beijing to demand greater freedoms, resulting in a disputed death toll ranging from 200 to 3,000. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, in which Hutu militias and government forces targeted Tutsis and moderates, is another stark example. The Holocaust, during which millions of Jews were systematically persecuted and killed, is a harrowing reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on jazz can be attributed to a unique combination of his remarkable longevity and compositional prowess. His remarkable ability to cultivate a cohesive ensemble identity lent itself to numerous iconic works that harmoniously integrated the talents of individual band members. While Ellington's piano presence may be understated in certain compositions, his skill as a composer lies in crafting intricate, layered pieces that showcased the distinctive strengths of each musician. By skillfully blending soloistic freedom with tightly woven orchestration, he created a musical landscape where each player could shine, whether through improvisation or carefully calibrated phrasing. This masterful approach enabled Ellington to craft some of the most innovative and groundbreaking works in jazz history.\n\nThe esteemed Grove Music dictionary highlights Ellington's innovative use of voice as a melodic instrument, evident in his early work, Creole Love Call. By incorporating vocal elements throughout his career, Ellington successfully added depth and nuance to his compositions without the confines of traditional lyrics. This 12-bar blues piece exemplifies his ability to complement the unique styles of his soloists, which remained a hallmark of his career. The structure of Creole Love Call consists of six distinct choruses:\n\n1. A call-and-response exchange between voice and reeds, commencing with a smooth, melodic tone that gradually gives way to a more rugged timbre.\n2. A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the core melody, emphasizing elongated notes and subtle nuances.\n3. A soaring clarinet solo, elevated by a syncopated piano accompaniment in a high register.\n4. The full ensemble recreates the first chorus, with a call-and-response exchange between brass and reed sections.\n5. A climactic finale, as the reeds now initiate the call-and-response, backed by staccato stop-time from the brass and rhythm sections.\n6. A return to the initial structure, with call-and-response between voice and reeds; in this final chorus, the vocalist adopts a \"growl\" technique, soloing as a true instrumental voice.\n\nThe piece concludes with a concise tag, featuring a vocal run and a dissonant, striking conclusion courtesy of a trombone.\n\nEllington's strategic incorporation of vocal elements to enhance his compositions is a recurring theme throughout his oeuvre, as seen in his subsequent works. Hot and Bothered, recorded a year after Creole Love Call, showcases Ellington's deft orchestration and keen ear for tonal color. A call-and-response phrase between Bubber Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing masterfully blends the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, yielding a rich and complementary sound. In It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing), Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's talents to introduce the melody on muted trombone, further exemplifying his ability to harness the unique strengths of each musician.",
            "A sense of emptiness had been prevalent in her life for what felt like an eternity. This unfulfilled longing had begun to manifest itself around the age of fourteen, as she navigated the challenges of adolescence. Several years later, at the age of seventeen, this feeling persisted, but her perspective had shifted. She now yearned for human connection rather than mere material possessions. However, her lack of interest in the opposite sex had left her puzzled and introspective. Some individuals had attempted to woo her, but none had sparked her genuine interest. She frequently questioned her own desires, seeking to comprehend the root cause of this unusual phenomenon.\n\nHer home life was generally tranquil, thanks to her parents' calm demeanor. They rarely argued with each other, and disagreements with their daughter were infrequent. Their infrequent disagreements revolved around her strong will and independent nature, which often created a delightful contrast to her parents' more reserved personalities. Her unique blend of warmth and kindness made her well-liked by those around her.\n\nOn this particular day, however, the atmosphere was far from peaceful. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was startled by a faint cry of distress coming from the kitchen. Her mother's voice, typically melodious, was now tinged with pain. She rushed into the room, alarm etched on her face, and frantically asked, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" Her mother lay on the floor, wincing in agony as she took short, labored breaths. Her daughter hastened to her side, placing a reassuring hand on her mother's arm. \"Ow... sweetheart, I need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother replied, her words rushed and laced with distress. Her daughter quickly assessed the situation and sprang into action. \"Okay, Mom, where am I picking you up?\" she asked, trying to stay calm. Her mother directed her, and her daughter was grateful for the physical training she had received. With a sense of resolve, she carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car.\n\nThe hospital's antiseptic scent and the air of anxiety that accompanied it were palpable, but her daughter's focus remained solely on her mother's well-being. She swiftly escorted her mother into the hospital and alerted the medical staff, who quickly gathered around. A gurney was brought, and her mother was gently placed on it. The doctors and nurses quickly attended to her, while her daughter was left to anxiously wait.\n\nIt turned out that her mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to retrieve a vase from the top shelf.",
            "A large-scale observational study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (Med Diet) and the incidence of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke in women. The study used a modified version of the Med Diet, known as the Alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet, which emphasizes a higher consumption of plant-based foods, including fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, as well as moderate intake of fish and low consumption of animal products and saturated fats. Moderate alcohol consumption was also allowed.\n\nPrevious studies have consistently shown an inverse association between adherence to the Med Diet and the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. Notably, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated the Med Diet's superiority over a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles among obese individuals. However, prior research had not specifically examined the relationship between the Med Diet and stroke or stroke mortality.\n\nThis study drew upon the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term cohort study of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The study enrolled 74,886 women aged 38-63 years without a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, participants completed six self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to assess their nutrient intake. The FFQs were validated through independent review of medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions were classified as \"probable\" cases due to lack of documentation.\n\nTo minimize individual variability and better capture long-term dietary habits, the researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs. The analysis controlled for potential confounding factors, including age, smoking status, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nThe study employed Cox proportional-hazard modeling to examine the association between aMed score and the risk of CHD and stroke. Separate models were used to analyze fatal and non-fatal CHD and stroke events.\n\nThe results showed a significant association between higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed score, and lower risk of CHD and stroke in women. Over 20 years of follow-up, 2,391 incident CHD cases, 1,763 stroke cases, and 1,077 cardiovascular disease deaths were documented. Women with the highest aMed scores exhibited a lower risk of CHD and stroke compared to those with the lowest scores, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "A pivotal moment in American financial history occurred in 2007, when the nation's economic stability began to unravel. The consequences of this crisis remain evident, with unemployment rates on the rise and several prominent corporations struggling to recover. It is essential to examine the underlying causes of this economic downturn and explore potential solutions to prevent future catastrophes.\n\nA critical examination of the events leading up to the crisis reveals a pattern of poor decision-making and inadequate regulatory oversight. Financial institutions, under pressure from both government policies and investors, extended large sums of credit to borrowers who lacked the means to repay. This reckless lending strategy, coupled with an inadequate financial infrastructure, created a perfect storm that eventually collapsed. The proliferation of mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and other complex financial instruments only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nHistorical records indicate that the seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, when the Clinton administration relaxed lending standards in an effort to boost public support. Fannie Mae, a leading provider of mortgage financing, was under pressure to expand its lending activities and maintain its growth trajectory. A 1999 article by Steven Holmes of the New York Times noted that Fannie Mae was driven to increase its mortgage lending among low-income borrowers, despite concerns about the potential risks. Holmes astutely predicted that such actions could lead to a government bailout, similar to the one implemented in the 1980s for the savings and loan industry.\n\nThe crisis was further fueled by the widespread adoption of complex financial products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. These instruments allowed households and financial institutions to take on excessive risk, leaving them vulnerable to even minor market fluctuations. The consequences were catastrophic, as the housing market bubble burst, and financial institutions were left reeling. The top U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt in 2007, accounting for approximately 30% of the nation's GDP. In the aftermath, several major financial institutions were forced to restructure or face intense regulatory scrutiny, while Fannie and Freddie were placed under government control, with a combined mortgage debt of $5 trillion.",
            "The dreaded exposition. A narrative device that can either elevate your writing to new heights or induce a collective yawn from your readers. Dr. Thompson has been known to mutter under her breath when faced with a lengthy passage of backstory, the words \"Show, don't tell\" echoing in her mind.\n\nWhile the adage is well-worn, Dr. Thompson still finds herself slipping into the trap of excessive narration. It's as if the critic within her voice whispers, \"Get the groundwork out of the way, get to the good stuff.\" This inner dialogue is not to be confused with the more persuasive voice urging her to reveal the intricacies of each character's past.\n\nExposition, in essence, is the act of telling rather than showing. It's the cinematic equivalent of a character dumping a wealth of information on another character, à la a filmic rendition of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" In written fiction, the author takes on this role.\n\nConsider a common scenario: a heroine meets her love interest at a specific time and place, they exchange vows in a grand ceremony, and tragically, he meets a violent end. One wouldn't expect this sequence to occupy an extended period, during which the husband and wife barely exchange a few lines of dialogue. A more effective approach would be to delve deeper into the husband's character, showcasing his devotion through his words and actions. Similarly, the heroine's transformation in the wake of his loss should be palpable, conveyed through her thoughts, behaviors, and interactions. This nuanced portrayal would allow readers to form an emotional connection with the couple and the heroine, ultimately making her grief more relatable and impactful.\n\nIn other words, a compelling narrative requires more than just the skeletal framework of \"They met, they married, he died.\" It demands the meat that brings the story to life.\n\nAs a writer, one must resist the temptation to rush past key details, such as a character's background. Take, for instance, a character who has a rich history – serving in the military, working as a night manager at a gas station, having been married twice, and harboring dreams of entrepreneurship. A brief summary of these facts might seem convenient, but it would only serve to leave readers with a vague impression. A more effective approach would be to seamlessly integrate these details into the narrative, allowing the character to emerge as a fully fleshed-out individual.",
            "I recently watched multiple broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first live segment caught my attention, which was a story about a violent incident in Ashley, Ohio. A man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was arrested for allegedly stabbing his wife, although her name was not disclosed. The news team presented his mug shot, which was striking. Despite its developing nature, the story received around two minutes of coverage. I believe this was a reasonable allocation of time.\n\nThe second report focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, where an 18-year-old, Travis Buyers, was critically injured. At the time, there were no suspects or arrests. The SWAT team was involved in the investigation. I noticed a relatively brief coverage, which might have been due to the fact that the incident occurred in a predominantly minority neighborhood. I have observed a pattern, which suggests that minority victims often receive less media attention than those from other backgrounds. This disparity in coverage is a concern I have been aware of for some time.\n\nThe subsequent story highlighted a gunshot wound discovered on a Med-Flight helicopter. The news team provided information about the suspected location and circumstances of the incident. Authorities believe a .22 caliber rifle was used, firing a bullet that hit the aircraft. A $5,000 reward was announced for tips that lead to the identification of the shooter.\n\nThe next segment addressed a weather forecast for the upcoming weekend, predicting rain and thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon. Temperatures were expected to range from the mid to low eighties. This story was likely included as a \"preview\" to keep viewers engaged.\n\nAnother report focused on a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road in Columbus. The perpetrator was described as a dark-skinned individual wearing a hoodie and standing at around six feet tall and 150 pounds. The news team emphasized his racial characteristics, which seemed unusual.\n\nFinally, a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted individual from Texas, was presented. He had been involved in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation, conspiring to distribute the substance from Texas to Ohio. I found it intriguing that instead of stating his prison sentence as 25 years, the news team mentioned \"300 months.\" It's unclear whether this was intended to convey a harsher punishment or not. Additionally, the mention of his Hispanic heritage seemed unnecessary.",
            "An intriguing aspect of human relationships is the profound connection that exists between siblings, particularly brothers. This bond is multifaceted and can encompass a range of complex emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and the capacity for cruelty. Brothers often possess an uncanny understanding of one another, which can be attributed to their unique bond. In times of crisis, the true nature of this connection is revealed, often showcasing both positive and negative traits. When these emotions become apparent, they can have far-reaching consequences.\n\nOne notable literary work, \"The Scarlet Ibis,\" explores this theme in depth. Set against the backdrop of a vibrant and detailed landscape, the narrative follows two brothers as they embark on a perilous journey. The story reaches its climax as bitter disappointment and intense pride collide, resulting in a tragic outcome where only one brother survives. The author masterfully conveys the complex emotions experienced by the protagonist and his brother through direct characterization and the narrator's perspective.\n\nThe protagonist's actions throughout the story can be largely attributed to his fixation on a single emotion: pride. From their initial outings to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist harbors resentment towards his younger brother, Doodle. He had envisioned having a partner with whom he could share his interests and skills, such as exploring the outdoors and engaging in physical activities. However, Doodle's physical limitations, a result of his weak heart, made these aspirations unattainable. The protagonist's disappointment and frustration are palpable, and he even grapples with the idea of suffocating his brother, a notion that raises questions about the depths of his emotions. Nevertheless, the brother's simple smile brings a glimmer of hope, revealing a more nuanced aspect of the protagonist's character.",
            "The cerebral cortex is a multifaceted, adaptive information-processing apparatus. As technological advancements unfold, the analogies employed to describe its functioning have undergone significant evolution. Initially, the brain was likened to a parchment, then to a scroll, and subsequently to a codex. Presently, the computer analogy has gained widespread acceptance. It's essential to acknowledge that these metaphors, although useful, have limitations and can lead to misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing commences with the reception of sensory data from the sensory organs, which convert physical stimuli, such as tactile sensations, thermal cues, acoustic waves, or photons, into electrochemical impulses. The processed sensory information undergoes iterative transformations through a combination of bottom-up and top-down processing mechanisms. For instance, when perceiving an image of a black square on a white background, bottom-up processing assembles fundamental components like color, orientation, and spatial boundaries – where color transitions significantly over a short distance – to infer the presence of a rectangular object. Top-down processing employs the decisions generated at intermediate stages of the bottom-up process to expedite recognition of the object. Top-down processing in this example might facilitate the identification of the object as a black square rather than a square-shaped recess in the white background.\n\nUpon achieving a certain level of processing, an attention filter determines the signal's priority and allocates access to relevant cognitive processes. For example, although the brain processes every individual blade of grass when gazing downwards, a healthy attention filter prevents conscious awareness of these details. Conversely, you might readily identify your name even in a noisy environment. There are numerous stages of processing, and the outcomes are modulated by attention at each stage.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first be stored within its internal frameworks. Various types of memory exist, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods tailored to specific types of sensory stimuli. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on its structural appearance, phonetic characteristics, or semantic meaning. Once stored, information must be maintained through a series of mechanisms. Research on animals suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on a transient electrical signal propagated through a sequence of neurons. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be sustained through the structural organization of certain types of proteins.\n\nSeveral models have been proposed to describe the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing from various disciplines such as human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model posits the existence of nodes representing concepts, which are interconnected based on their semantic relationships. For example, in a semantic network, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which can be linked to \"wood,\" and so on.",
            "In his dystopian novel, Brave New World, Aldous Huxley presents a scathing critique of the emerging technocratic and capitalist systems of his time. The novel's citizens are conditioned to prioritize collective well-being over individuality, with their desires manipulated by the ruling World Controller. Through a Marxist lens, the work can be seen as a commentary on the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the exploitation of the masses. The novel's use of terms such as homogeny and reification suggests that Huxley was concerned about the homogenization of society and the reduction of people to mere commodities.\n\nThe novel also satirizes capitalism by illustrating the concept of false consciousness, where the working class is kept ignorant of their true relationship to the ruling elite. The conditioning of the population through hypnopædia ensures that they are driven by a desire for consumption and indulgence, rather than critical thinking or independent decision-making. This is a classic example of ideological control, where the ruling class maintains its power by manipulating the perceptions and desires of the masses.\n\nThe social hierarchy in Brave New World is also a clear illustration of hegemony, where a dominant group exercises control over the rest of society. The lower classes are unaware of their oppression, while the upper classes are complicit in their own subjugation. This is evident in the interactions between characters, which are superficial and lacking in depth. The novel suggests that the pursuit of material wealth and status has eroded the capacity for genuine human connection and emotion, leaving individuals feeling isolated and disconnected.\n\nFurthermore, the novel's portrayal of relationships between characters highlights the effects of capitalism on human relationships. The emphasis on physical appearance and superficial interactions is a commentary on the ways in which capitalism reduces people to commodities and objects of desire. The complacency of the lower classes in their assigned roles within the social hierarchy is also a reflection of Marxist ideas about the proletariat, who are manipulated into believing they are superior to others as long as they conform to societal expectations and continue to consume and obey.\n\nBy examining Brave New World through a Marxist framework, it becomes clear that Huxley was warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancement and the exploitation of the masses by capitalist systems. His novel remains a powerful commentary on the consequences of a society that prioritizes material wealth and status over individual freedom and human connection.",
            "I've been a part of the University Park community for a little over two and a half years now. One of the challenges many of us face is navigating the campus. During my first year, I was housed in an East Halls dorm, situated at the eastern edge of campus. Commuting from my residence in Stuart Hall to classes in the Willard building, situated near the heart of campus, often took around 25 minutes on foot, especially during inclement weather, which is a common occurrence in State College. A conversation with an alumnus roughly my age shed light on the campus's past development. In the not-so-distant past, the East Halls dorms were separated from the rest of the university by a significant expanse of undeveloped land. This vacant space has since been transformed into sports fields, new facilities like the Creamery and health services building, and surrounding apartments. As the campus continues to expand, mobility becomes increasingly complicated. To effectively address the issue, I believe the bicycle offers a viable solution. However, owning a bike is merely the first step – students must also take advantage of it, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with cyclists' needs in mind.\n\nDiscussing the benefits of cycling with a friend who resumed riding after a hiatus highlighted its appeal. \"Bikes are fantastic,\" he said. \"For a while, it wasn't cool to ride, but it's the only practical way to get around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling is a highly efficient mode of transportation. After a bowl of oatmeal and some exercise, one can cover significant distances. Given that I reside off-campus, about the same distance from the campus center as some dorms, acquiring a bike has been one of the best decisions I've made. Daily classes in the Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, can now be reached in just 5 minutes if I pedal at a decent pace. However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas building from my house, presents some challenges, regardless of the mode of transportation. In my opinion, cycling is the most suitable option, considering my busy schedule. If I didn't have my bike, walking would be my only reliable means of transportation, which would not only be time-consuming but also impractical given my daily commitments. Walking to Thomas every day would add an extra 30-40 minutes to my daily routine, translating to over two and a half hours per week. When factoring in other walking time for classes, appointments, and other activities, this becomes unsustainable."
