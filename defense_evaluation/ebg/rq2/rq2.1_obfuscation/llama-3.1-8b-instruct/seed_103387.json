            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Exploring the Complexities of Insomnia Through the Lens of Biological and Sociocultural Perspectives\n\nInsomnia, a widespread sleep disorder, can be understood through the interplay of biological and sociocultural factors. The biological model examines the genetic and physiological aspects of insomnia, while the sociocultural model delves into the environmental influences of demographics, socioeconomic status, and cultural background. This paper reviews existing research to understand how these models intersect and inform our understanding of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with mental health conditions, and sleep disorders related to medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias including insomnia and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy, characterized by cataplexy and automatic REM behavior, is also part of this category. Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve sleep-related behavioral or physiological abnormalities, such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking.\n\nResearch suggests that the biological model of sleep disorders is centered around the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiological mechanisms. A study utilizing mouse models found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. The use of GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, has been shown to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This research has implications for understanding the genetic and environmental basis of sleep disorders in humans and suggests that alterations in the GABAB receptor may contribute to insomnia.\n\nFrom a sociocultural perspective, the findings of this study have significant implications. If the GABAB receptor's phenotype is inherited, it may influence sleep patterns, and alterations to this receptor could disrupt sleep, leading to negative consequences in daily life, such as impaired cognitive function and reduced productivity. This highlights the importance of considering the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in understanding insomnia and developing effective treatments.",
            "Auditory processing disorders can have a profound impact on individuals' daily lives. In this paper, we will delve into the intricacies of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the brain's ability to process sound information. We will examine the definition of CAPD, its diagnosis, and provide practical advice on how educators can support students with this condition in a mainstreamed classroom setting.\n\nCAPD is a neurological disorder characterized by the brain's impaired ability to interpret and process auditory information. Unlike hearing loss, which affects the ear's ability to detect sound, CAPD is a disorder of the central nervous system. People with CAPD can hear sounds with normal clarity, but their brains have difficulty distinguishing between background noise and meaningful sounds, or differentiating between multiple auditory stimuli.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has been around since the mid-20th century, when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" Since then, various tests have been developed to assess and diagnose the condition. For instance, the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of auditory tests in the 1950s, while the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association notes that the work of Kimura in the 1960s laid the groundwork for understanding the neural basis of auditory processing.\n\nThose affected by CAPD may exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between similar sounds, recognizing patterns, and detecting changes in speech tone or pitch. They may also struggle to filter out background noise or prioritize relevant auditory information. Furthermore, their brains may have difficulty processing sequential auditory information, which can lead to confusion and difficulty following conversations.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a combination of observational assessments and standardized tests. These evaluations typically involve observing the individual's listening behaviors, as well as their performance on tasks that assess auditory processing skills. While there is no single test that can definitively diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation can help identify the underlying challenges and develop targeted interventions.\n\nIn the following sections, we will examine the practical implications of CAPD in a mainstreamed classroom setting and provide guidance on how educators can support students with this condition.",
            "The play Twelfth Night presents a complex exploration of deception and its consequences, raising questions about the delicate balance between self-preservation and social relationships. Deception, particularly in the guise of gender role reversal, can be a double-edged sword: while it may initially provide a means of protection, it ultimately risks alienating the individual from their support network and forcing them to confront the consequences of their actions.\n\nViola's situation serves as a prime example of this dilemma. Disguising herself as a man allows her to navigate a foreign land safely, but it also creates a disconnect with the women around her and leads to complications with her own emotional desires. Her portrayal as Cesario sparks confusion, not only for Olivia but also within herself, as she grapples with suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino. The dynamics between these characters highlight the tension between authenticity and deception, making it difficult to discern what is genuine and what is a performance.\n\nIn examining the theme of deception, Twelfth Night also touches on the idea that it can be a catalyst for the revelation of suppressed emotions. The relationships between Olivia, Cesario/Viola, and Orsino are characterized by a web of unexpressed desires and conflicting feelings, which are brought to the surface through the complex web of deceptions. While Olivia's swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian may suggest that her initial attachment was superficial, it also raises questions about the nature of her desires and the extent to which they are influenced by societal norms.\n\nShakespeare's portrayal of Olivia, in particular, can be seen as a commentary on the superficiality of appearances and the tendency to judge others based on surface level characteristics. Her character's ease in switching between romantic interests and familial relationships serves as a commentary on the fluidity of human emotions and the impact of societal expectations on our understanding of ourselves and others.\n\nUltimately, Twelfth Night presents a nuanced exploration of the consequences of deception and the complexities of human relationships, leaving the audience to ponder the trade-offs between authenticity and self-preservation.",
            "The legacy of German colonial rule in various regions has been characterized by notable brutality, exemplified by the tragic events of the Ovaherero and Nama genocides in German South West Africa. A more nuanced understanding, however, is necessary to fully grasp the complexities of this colonial empire, which exhibited a multiplicity of policies and governing styles across its vast territories. Educational systems, for instance, demonstrated a considerable degree of diversity, with marked differences in approach and emphasis from one colony to another.\n\nUpon assuming control of German East Africa (present-day Tanzania) in 1919, British authorities found a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. This was in stark contrast to the situation in German Kamerun and other colonies, where German efforts to establish a robust educational framework were widely acknowledged by contemporary observers. The dichotomy between German East Africa and South West Africa (present-day Namibia) is particularly striking. In the former, government-sponsored institutions played a significant role in the education of local populations, whereas in the latter, missionary organizations bore the primary responsibility for educating natives, with government support being relatively limited.\n\nGovernment investment in European education in South West Africa was substantial, with a network of state schools and a more detailed system of regulation and support for missionary institutions. The long-term consequences of these educational policies persisted long after the end of German rule. Unlike other German colonies, which boasted a considerable proportion of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, with an overwhelming majority of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate. This discrepancy is attributed to a multifaceted array of social, economic, and political factors. This paper aims to augment existing research by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans and exploring the implications of their perspectives.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is extensive and diverse, with a significant proportion of sources written in German during the early 20th century. These early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems of individual colonies. Later studies, often written in English, expanded the scope of the discussion through comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth investigations of specific aspects of education. Notable among these studies is Cohen's comparative examination of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which highlights the factors contributing to the differences between the two colonies. Cohen suggests that the significant settler population in South West Africa played a pivotal role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively temperate climate, despite its arid desert regions, attracted a substantial European population, with approximately 15,000 settlers residing in the territory by 1913. This was significantly higher than the number of settlers in the colony with the next largest population, East Africa, where only around 5,336 settlers resided. The demographic composition of the region had a profound impact on the development of local educational systems and continues to influence the region's social and economic landscape to this day.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has been a dynamic and multifaceted process, resulting in an astonishing array of genres that defy easy categorization. The proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within these categories has further complicated the landscape, with many styles, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, branching out into distinct and innovative offshoots. Among these, heavy metal has emerged as a particularly expressive and diverse genre, marked by a predilection for the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy metal's versatility has allowed it to incorporate a wide range of themes and influences, giving rise to a dizzying array of niches and sub-niches that have evolved over the past four decades. This proliferation has led to a situation where it is increasingly difficult to define the genre, which has incorporated elements from various styles while retaining its core identity. To fully grasp the metal music that permeates contemporary music scenes, it is essential to understand the underlying ethos and historical context of the heavy metal movement.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is characterized by a distinctive aesthetic of excess – more intensity, more volume, more theatricality, and more complexity. Skilled musicianship is a hallmark of the genre, with many metal bands showcasing their technical prowess through intricate instrumentation. Additionally, the genre has been shaped by its association with substance use, particularly in the 1970s, when psychedelic experimentation led to the creation of innovative and otherworldly sounds. The incorporation of dark, visceral qualities, reminiscent of the Romantic Era, has also contributed to the genre's distinctive character.\n\nThe influence of these elements can be seen in the work of pioneering bands, such as the Beatles, who pushed the boundaries of heavy music with songs like \"Helter Skelter.\" This influential track, often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, was a response to the Rolling Stones' darker sound and a demonstration of the Beatles' ability to tackle more intense themes. The song's incorporation into the Beatles' landmark album, The White Album, marked a significant moment in the development of heavy metal.",
            "Henri Rousseau's artistic journey, spanning several decades prior to the emergence of the Surrealist movement, was marked by a unique blend of literal and figurative dreamscapes. His painting, 'The Dream,' created in 1910, serves as a poignant representation not only of a woman enthralled by the wonders of a dream world but also of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he grappled with a profound internal conflict: the desire for recognition and acceptance by the art world, which he deeply admired, versus the need to remain true to his artistic vision and creative independence.\n\nTo fully appreciate the significance of 'The Dream,' it is essential to understand the circumstances that shaped Rousseau's life and artistic trajectory. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a town in northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Despite his father's social standing, Rousseau's early life was marked by a lack of formal artistic training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll service employee, known as a gabelou, for nearly four decades, earning the informal title of douanier, customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau with a single child, Julia, and a profound sense of sorrow. He found solace in painting, which became a source of comfort and a means to start anew.\n\nIn contrast to his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class, Rousseau's work reflects the hopes and dreams of the common man. His struggle to gain recognition in the art world, particularly during a time when many talented and well-established artists, including Matisse, were active, is understandable given his late start and limited formal training. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's motivation to create conventional art was driven by a desire to be accepted into the prestigious Artiste Français, whereas Matisse sought to avoid clichéd representations in his work. Rousseau's dual aspirations – to be acknowledged by the art world while staying true to his artistic voice – are poignantly captured in 'The Dream,' a painting that continues to captivate audiences with its poignant blend of artistic expression and personal longing.",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has long been a subject of contemplation among thinkers. It's a notion that resonates deeply, one that has been echoed by visionaries such as John Keats, who so elegantly phrased it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The truth is that much of our understanding is shaped by education and experience, yet we intuitively grasp the essence of beauty and morality without explicit instruction. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate, and our exploration of morality and beauty is an attempt to unravel the enigma of what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action morally sound, rather than establishing a set of rules for evaluation or creation. \n\nWhat's more, criticism of art or morals often falls short of capturing the true essence of goodness or beauty. A discussion about, for example, the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into concepts like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these aspects merely scratch the surface. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morality defy reduction to a comprehensive description of their qualities. As the astute author Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics possesses this elusive quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this enigmatic aspect is art and morality's most compelling attribute, and that their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nIt's striking that we experience both ethics and aesthetics at a profound, almost ineffable level, which the philosopher Immanuel Kant would call noumenal. They touch us on a plane that can be felt, but not fully articulated. This connection is especially evident in literature, where the moral dimension is integral to its essence. As philosopher Ian McKean insightfully pointed out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are less relevant to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern landscape is a testament to its robust identity, forged from a rich tapestry of regional influences that stretch from the Alpine foothills to the Baltic coast. This diversity is palpable in the unique cultural nuances of cities like München, Köln, and Dresden, each with its own distinct character. The country's history is a complex tapestry woven from the threads of multiple ancestral groups, their origins shrouded in mystery and subject to ongoing scholarly debate.\n\nThe term \"Germania\" evokes the ancestral homeland of the German people, but its etymology remains a topic of heated discussion among historians and linguists. Some attribute the name to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, while others point to the word \"germanus,\" first employed by Julius Caesar in his commentary on the Gallic Wars. Caesar, in his observations on the Gallic Wars, noted the Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine, and used the term to distinguish those he had conquered from those he had not. The Gauls, it is believed, borrowed the word from their own language, using it to describe their neighbors.\n\nCaesar's writings in the first book of his Commentarii de Bello Gallico provide insight into the Germanic tribes: \"Those who reside beyond the Rhine, with whom they are constantly at war...They engage in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) The etymology of \"Germania\" has been the subject of various theories, including a possible connection to the spear, known as a \"ger,\" or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout.\" This could suggest that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature.\n\nTacitus, in his seminal work \"De Origine et Situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, portrays the Germans as a distinct people, untouched by external influences: \"I would regard them as indigenous, unmixed with other races through immigration or intermarriage. For those who sought to emigrate would arrive by sea, not by land...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy, for Germany, with its harsh climate, its unforgiving skies, its severe demeanor, unless it were their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98) The Romans, while extending their dominion over Germania, seemed reluctant to settle within its borders, preferring to maintain their influence through military campaigns and trade. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their military prowess as soldiers in the Roman army.

            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted down, my mind hovering in a state of mental stillness. The scene before me was a kaleidoscope of stimuli, yet my consciousness processed it with an almost detached objectivity. My thoughts darted in and out of my awareness with the speed of a whispered secret, leaving no lasting impression. It was as if my mental state was a fluid, ever-changing entity, unencumbered by the weight of personal interpretation.\n\nMy interest in drawing began at an early age, and I had been drawn to the idea of understanding the underlying mechanisms of perception. This led me to read \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" an art instruction book that offered a comprehensive guide to the fundamentals of visual representation. One technique that resonated with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying the complexity of the world into a manageable, two-dimensional plane.\n\nAs I stood in front of the bowl, I found myself unable to apply this concept. The overwhelming richness of the scene held me in its grasp, and I was left transfixed, a captive of its beauty. I thought of the great masters – Picasso's blue period, Monet's lush landscapes, and the Renaissance artists' mastery of color. If I were to venture into the realm of artistic expression, this moment might be the start of my journey, a blank canvas waiting for my brushstrokes.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and with a subtle tension, I began to create. The movement was almost meditative, my mind channeling its will into the physical act of drawing. The water in the bowl seemed to swirl and shimmer, its calm surface reflecting the turmoil brewing within me. But my creative energy was short-lived, as my hand jerked back, my fingers tightening around the pencil handle. The seemingly inert mass of brown matter, stuck to the underside of the toilet, defied my artistic intent. I stood there, my emotions simmering beneath the surface, as I gazed at the unyielding, uncooperative \"art piece.\"\n\nI stood up straight, and with a growing sense of purpose, my hand grasped the toilet paper roll, its cardboard core digging gently into my palm. The sheets rustled softly as I wrapped them around my hand, a makeshift mitt that would protect me from the unyielding mass before me. Slowly, I leaned forward, my hand dipping into the bowl, a deliberate, almost ceremonial gesture, as if I were about to retrieve a sacred relic from the depths of the earth.",
            "Youthful drivers are consistently prone to high-risk behavior behind the wheel.  This problem stems from a multifaceted set of factors. Research has shown that the adolescent brain is not sufficiently developed to fully grasp the complexities of driving, a notion supported by the National Institutes of Health. Furthermore, a lack of driving experience is a significant contributor to accidents, as novice drivers are more likely to engage in reckless behavior such as speeding and loss of control, resulting in a higher incidence of rollovers and collisions. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of peers in the vehicle increases the likelihood of accidents. A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.  In an effort to mitigate these risks, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely temporary solutions to a more fundamental issue.\n\nThe key issue lies in the inherent limitations of young drivers, as evidenced by statistical data. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that young people, particularly those under 19 or 20, are more inclined to engage in risk-taking behavior due to a desire for thrills. To address this, it may be wise to delay the issuance of full driver's licenses until this tendency has diminished. Continuously granting licenses to young teens will only perpetuate a cycle of fatal accidents, and the consequences may be catastrophic, especially as the baby boom generation's offspring will soon be entering the driving population.\n\nLegislative action could involve a nationwide approach. Schools could continue to offer driver education courses to prepare future drivers, but individuals under the age of 18 would be prohibited from operating a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full license, accompanied by a set number of required practice hours, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult, as seen in California. A uniform national standard would be an effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country.\n\nThis proposal is not an innovative concept, but a sound approach to addressing the pressing issue of youthful driving fatalities.",
            "Browsing through the vast repository of early Edison films housed at the Library of Congress, I opted to explore a select group of 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films predominantly utilized innovative editing techniques to craft convincing illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles governing the majority of trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that distinguished a few of the later entries. \n\nGenerally, trick films produced during the turn of the century adhered to a distinct set of conventions: they were studio-bound, confined within a rigid proscenium framework, featured static camera positions, and relied on long and medium shots, all of which were bound by the rule of one shot per film. However, a few films from the early 20th century began to experiment with this paradigm by introducing multiple shots.\n\nA notable commonality among trick films was their use of an interior set situated within the confines of a proscenium frame. The camera remained fixed in its position, failing to pan or track subjects or objects within the scene. This composition drew its inspiration from the theater and, more specifically, the conventions of vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation inherent in the use of the stage was the restricted movement of figures within the frame, which typically confined actors to lateral motion, preventing them from advancing or retreating towards the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move horizontally, only to disappear from view without the camera following.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also led to an emphasis on long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups were notably absent from the Edison catalog of trick films, a nod to the theatrical tradition where audiences would observe the entire performance within a framed stage. In line with conventions of early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, thus precluding the use of close-ups. \n\nMost trick films from the period adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot per film, resulting in a typical length of one minute or less, contingent on the frame rate employed. This restriction also limited the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and substitution acts, devoid of a cohesive narrative. However, a closer examination of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between physical shots and perceived shots. Specifically, a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple joined shots, skillfully crafted to create the illusion of a seamless, magical transition.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an impassioned advocate of Republicanism, whose career as an agriculturalist and brief foray into politics forged a life defined by unwavering dedication and unflinching outspokenness on the principles of individual liberty and governance. His deep-seated commitment to an agrarian way of life served as the bedrock for his philosophical stance on the role of government, which he sought to maintain and promote as the foundation for a robust society.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to establish an exemplary system of government, unencumbered by the legacy of a native tradition. This enabled the country's founders to craft a system of self-governance that would prioritize the intrinsic rights of citizens, which he believed were interconnected and mutually dependent. The denial of one right would undermine the integrity of the entire set of rights, diminishing their value. Consequently, he contended that these fundamental rights should remain beyond the reach of government overreach.\n\nIn his vision for an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must balance the inherent duality of human nature, recognizing both the capacity for good and evil. He subscribed to a strict dualism, arguing that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Taylor's conception of good governance emphasized the protection of private property, agricultural advancement, and the discouragement of unchecked capitalism. He believed that a government founded on these principles would operate equitably, even with administration by individuals driven by self-interest – a trait he deemed universal among humans, but only problematic when it led to the exploitation of others. A judicious government was necessary to harness human nature's darker aspects, while vigilantly monitoring the introduction of corrosive influences.\n\nTaylor, like many fellow Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, championing an extremely limited federal government with powers strictly defined by the document's explicit text. He recognized that a large federal government would be prone to despotism due to its expense. However, he cautioned that a literalist approach could be perilous, as it might ignore the intent of the Constitution's authors, leading to distortions and corruption. Furthermore, Taylor regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundational document of the United States, as it explicitly articulated the nation's character as a collective of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon reviewing the data presented in Figure 17, it is noteworthy that a significant decline in commuter log submissions occurred during the third month of the project. Several factors could have contributed to this decrease. For instance, the onset of winter at a New England campus often leads to a reduction in alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles and walking, as the weather becomes increasingly inclement. Additionally, the end of the fall semester in December is a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with completing coursework, receiving grades, and winding down for the holiday season. Consequently, the commuter log may have fallen by the wayside for many individuals. Furthermore, the university's holiday break and subsequent closure of campus for an extended period may have also impacted participation.\n\nNotably, the commencement of the spring semester in late January did not rectify the issue, suggesting that factors beyond seasonal fluctuations may be at play. It is possible that the project's initial enthusiasm and participation waned over time, a phenomenon not unique to this initiative. In an effort to counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign designed to reignite interest and stimulate increased log submissions, which ultimately succeeded in achieving this goal.\n\nOne of the primary challenges encountered was maintaining momentum in the face of predictable dips in engagement, particularly during semester breaks and the holiday season. Another hurdle is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving and the freedom it affords. To address this, we implemented an incentive system, offering prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and retailers. While the rewards were well-received initially, it is intriguing to consider whether more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or alternative fuel vehicles, might have had a greater impact on participation. Exploring this variable could have provided valuable insights into the project's dynamics and potentially mitigated the observed decline in engagement. A key takeaway is that offering escalating rewards over time may have helped sustain interest and participation throughout the project.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer an alternative to traditional index funds and individual stock investments, providing diversification and flexible trading options. One of the key benefits of ETFs is their ability to track a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets, while also allowing for short selling, margin buying, and low minimum share requirements. Notably, ETFs have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund, making them an attractive option for investors. However, it's essential to consider the associated trading commissions, which can be a drawback. The ETF market offers a wide range of investment portfolios, and investors should carefully evaluate the benefits and potential drawbacks of each.\n\nIn this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF, examining its top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of the fund's assets. By analyzing these holdings, we aim to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. Additionally, we will investigate whether alternative configurations of these stocks could provide a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we will concentrate on the top 10 holdings, rather than the entire ETF portfolio. The holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets are presented below. We will then use this information to estimate the potential performance of a portfolio consisting of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF.\n\nThe results of our analysis indicate that a portfolio comprising the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return (6.11%) and lower beta (-0.12) compared to the ETF IHF. However, it is essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this question, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing the values to facilitate comparison with the ETF's standard deviation. This analysis will help us determine whether the differences in performance between the two portfolios are statistically meaningful.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's poems often regarded as a standout work is \"Dream-Land.\" A notable aspect of this poem lies in Poe's use of the term \"Thulé,\" which appears in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott, this term is linked back to the Roman poet Virgil, who employed it to describe an island situated north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the ancient Greeks.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the term \"Thulé\" may also be associated with a more contemporary source, given Poe's evident affinity for German literature. In fact, Poe's interest in the works of German authors, including notable writers such as Goethe, is well-documented.\n\nA quote from Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights the similarity between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's literary style, suggesting a possible influence. Specifically, Arndt observes a striking resemblance between Poe's poem and Goethe's \"Faust,\" a celebrated poetic drama published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing.\n\nWithin \"Faust,\" a smaller poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" is embedded in the second part. This poem tells the story of a king whose wife passes away, gifting him a goblet before her death. Consumed by grief, the king becomes a recluse, resorting to excessive drinking and ultimately decides to take his own life, bequeathing his possessions to his children and discarding the goblet into the ocean. A similar air of desolation and despair pervades Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" which echoes the temperament and magnanimity of the King of Thulé.\n\nInterestingly, a stage adaptation of \"Faust\" was composed by H.P. Gratton in 1842, mere months before Poe's own use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule not once, but twice in his collected works, employing \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and book-ending \"Dream-Land\" with it. This could be seen as a nod to Goethe's \"Faust\" and its companion piece, \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nUpon closer examination, it becomes clear that \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share striking similarities. Both poems explore the themes of isolation, loss, and a world devoid of vibrancy, evoking a sense of melancholy that permeates both works. Furthermore, Goethe's influence on Poe cannot be understated, given the latter's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who was well-acquainted with Goethe's work. Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is also evident in the numerous reproductions and adaptations of his works that were prevalent during Poe's time.",
            "In the event of an individual suffering harm after slipping and falling on a spill in a grocery store, they may be eligible to receive punitive damages if the store manager demonstrated a reckless disregard for the consequences of their inaction. This could potentially be the case if the manager was informed of the spill and chose not to address it due to personal obligations, specifically eating dinner, while being aware of previous incidents involving similar accidents.\n\nA court is unlikely to dismiss a claim for punitive damages without further consideration. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant's actions were taken with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm they could cause and were considered despicable. In this instance, Jennifer Palmer may argue that Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the consequences of not cleaning the spill, given the multiple previous incidents of slips and falls in the store. Furthermore, despite this knowledge, he failed to take action to rectify the situation.\n\nPalmer's argument that Martin's actions can be characterized as despicable is not entirely convincing, but it is still a plausible argument. This is particularly evident given the six slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009 and the failure of the manager to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, notified his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. However, Martin declined to address the issue, stating that he was on a dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, to which he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five separate slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the court is considering whether to grant a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty that does not arise from a contractual obligation if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California's Civil Code states that malice is characterized as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is despicable and carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have determined that conduct is malicious when it involves a deliberate disregard for the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant is aware of the potential dangers of their actions and willfully ignores them. This was the case in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, where the court ruled that a defendant's actions were malicious due to their conscious disregard for the consequences of their behavior.",
            "It has been nearly four years since I took a course in Islamic studies at a local institution. Our class discussions often centered around the perception of Islam in modern society, with some classmates questioning whether the religion is inherently hostile. This debate seems more pressing now than ever, particularly in light of recent global events. Observing the shift in media narratives on Islam from a predominantly negative to excessively tolerant stance following the 9/11 attacks has been striking. It is intriguing to consider how a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim connection, such as Barack Obama, could have gained traction in American politics.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a thought-provoking subject for me. Contrary to my initial understanding, his life story diverges significantly from the image of a ruthless conqueror who imposed his faith upon others. Instead, the biography portrays Muhammad as a complex, compassionate individual who was often misunderstood and humbled by his experiences. According to the narrative, his message resonated with individuals who were drawn to his wisdom and conviction, rather than through coercion.\n\nNotably, there are parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad. For instance, the account of multiplying food to feed a group of people bears a striking resemblance to similar stories in the Christian scriptures. This narrative device, used to emphasize Muhammad's humility and reliance on divine guidance, raises questions about the nature of truth and the role of miracles in both faith traditions. While the intention may have been to humanize Muhammad, it inadvertently downplays the unique significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nAnother aspect of the biography that struck me was the emphasis on testimonials and conversions. The stories, often relayed through secondary sources, seem designed to provide anecdotal evidence of the Prophet's impact. However, this approach creates a sense of detachment and raises concerns about the reliability of these accounts.\n\nWhat unsettles me most about this biography is the effort to portray Muhammad as a paragon of virtue, embodying qualities such as compassion, wisdom, and gentleness. Historical accounts, however, often contradict this image, leaving me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the complexities and nuances of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The trajectory of Christian thought in the immediate aftermath of Jesus' life reveals a gradual departure from its foundational principles.  Observing this historical narrative in broad strokes, we notice a progressive divergence from the original teachings of Jesus.  Despite the persistence of traditionalists who cling to established dogma, their influence is unlikely to be decisive in shaping the broader trajectory of Christian thought.  A growing awareness of historical context will undoubtedly gain momentum in the years to come, prompting a renewed interest in discerning the authentic essence of Christianity from the accretions that have accumulated over time.  As this awareness spreads, it will become increasingly evident that a profound shift is underway, one that will ultimately lead to a return to the fundamental principles that Jesus embodied.  This reversal of the trend in Christian history will unfold gradually, with the removal of extraneous doctrines, layer by layer, as if time itself is rewinding.  The end result will be a reclamation of the core teachings of Jesus, stripped of the varnish of later interpretations.  As this process takes hold in the Western world, we can expect to see a more unified and homogeneous Christian practice emerging, with the church serving as a guiding force.  This phenomenon is not unique to Christianity; human history is replete with examples of reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a pagan state to a Christian institution, and the progression from African-American slavery to African-American leadership in the United States.  A similar reversal is likely to occur within Christianity, driven by a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' teachings as metaphorical rather than literal.  To grasp the scope of this transformation, we must first examine the antecedents of Christianity.  The Hebrew scriptures, which formed the bedrock of Jewish thought by the time the Romans seized control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., reveal a complex and multifaceted tradition.  The Jewish population was not monolithic, comprising various factions such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common folk.",
            "The notion that individuals are inherently self-serving and egocentric is a pervasive theme in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. This notion is exemplified through the actions of the factory owners and managers who prioritize profit over the well-being of their employees and the environment. Their relentless pursuit of expansion and wealth is depicted as callous and devoid of empathy, as exemplified by the stark image of the factory buildings and the pollution they produce. Sinclair's vivid description of the smoke billowing from the chimneys serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating impact of industrialization on the community.\n\nThe exploitation of workers by their employers is another key aspect of the novel. The owners and managers demonstrate a ruthless disregard for their employees' welfare, pushing them to work excessive hours without adequate compensation or support. The lack of regulatory frameworks in place during the era allowed these practices to thrive, forcing workers to endure hazardous conditions and grueling working hours. The narrative implies that the working class was expected to accept these circumstances, with little to no recourse or assistance available to them.\n\nThe notion of workers as slaves is a powerful metaphor used to convey the extent of their exploitation. The formation of unions, intended to provide a voice for workers, often ended up exacerbating their situation, profiting from their struggles. The novel paints a bleak picture of a system that perpetuates immorality and oppression, with the workers' circumstances eerily mirroring those of enslaved individuals under the system of chattel slavery.\n\nIn this context, Sinclair's work serves as a scathing critique of the social and economic systems of his time, highlighting the need for reform and greater accountability. By shedding light on the darker aspects of industrialization, The Jungle encourages readers to confront the harsh realities of exploitation and to advocate for change.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald employs various literary techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby to elicit distinct responses from his readers. Among these techniques, the use of juxtaposition and symbolism stands out for its effectiveness. By pairing seemingly incongruous words and imbuing symbols with meaning, Fitzgerald creates a rich tapestry of emotions and associations. The author's utilization of color symbolism is a notable example of this technique. He repeatedly associates specific colors with particular connotations, often leveraging these associations to convey deeper meaning.\n\nIn the novel, Fitzgerald establishes a nuanced relationship between the colors white and gray. Initially, these colors are presented as polar opposites, with white signifying elegance and refinement, while gray connotes a sense of age and faded grandeur. Fitzgerald sets the stage for this dichotomy early on, depicting characters and settings clad in white, such as Nick's \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party and Tom's \"white shirt\" during his encounter with Myrtle. The exception to this rule is Nick's experience of Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors,\" suggesting a departure from the typically uniform presentation of white.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces the meanings he has assigned to these colors by applying them to everyday, mundane subjects. For instance, the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable serve to underscore the uniformity and conformity of these environments. Additionally, Fitzgerald uses these colors to describe people and places that are plain or unremarkable, such as the \"gray child\" in the railroad and the \"gray old man\" who sells dogs.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of these colors, Fitzgerald begins to use them to convey a sense of lackluster or uniformity, particularly in the context of Daisy Buchanan. Following a period of relative absence from these colors, Daisy is reintroduced wearing a \"white roadster,\" which subtly shifts the reader's perception of her from a fully fleshed-out character to a more diminished, uniform presence. This technique is reinforced by subsequent descriptions of Daisy, such as the \"gray haze of her fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "In the southernmost part of California, San Diego County boasts a prime agricultural location, characterized by a benign climate with ample sunlight. The region's farmland is home to a diverse range of crops, including leafy greens, broccoli, squash, tomatoes, citrus fruits, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, and various types of peppers. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is substantial, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic dairy and eggs are also highly sought after, with several local farms offering tours and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching on their premises. This type of operation presents an opportunity for landowners to participate in government programs while enhancing the natural habitat, allowing for tourism and educational initiatives.\n\nWhile organic farming offers several benefits, including increased biodiversity and reduced chemical usage, it also comes with higher operational costs. Organic farming requires more labor-intensive practices, such as hand-weeding and manual fertilization, which can lead to greater losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often struggle to achieve the same level of efficiency as larger commercial operations. Furthermore, certain conservation practices, like planting cover crops and invasive species removal, can also increase labor costs.\n\nThe chosen property, situated adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is a 160-acre parcel of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the area is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered and declining species. The land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. This specific parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo create a realistic model for a small farmer in this area, I researched government programs and chose a piece of property from a real estate website. A nearby organic farm serves as an example of what a landowner might aim to achieve, balancing economic viability with wildlife conservation.",
            "Effective negotiation is heavily influenced by the cultural context in which it takes place. Culture is a complex and multifaceted entity, often defined by its nuances and subtleties rather than its explicit characteristics. Statements that attempt to generalize an entire culture can be misleading and oversimplify its intricacies, such as labeling an entire nation as \"stubborn\" or \"accommodating.\" A more productive approach is to focus on the specific cultural attitudes and values that are relevant to the negotiation, as these will have a direct impact on the dynamics of the conversation.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, it's natural to draw comparisons to one's own cultural background. However, successful negotiation requires more than just a superficial understanding of cultural differences. It demands a deeper appreciation for the historical, social, and psychological factors that shape a culture, including its values, biases, and ingrained behaviors. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's essential to respect its unique characteristics and work within its framework, especially when navigating unfamiliar territory.\n\nThe concept of culture is often misunderstood as being strictly tied to national identity. In reality, corporate and organizational cultures can exhibit distinct characteristics that differ from the broader societal culture. For instance, a company may prioritize a fast-paced work environment or emphasize employee well-being, leading to differences in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within a single company, regional and departmental differences can create diverse perspectives and approaches to negotiation.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's underlying values is crucial, as they provide the foundation for its behavior and decision-making. For example, in cultures where saving face is paramount, a negotiator will likely avoid public displays of conflict or compromise. Conversely, cultures that prioritize a tough bargain may be more willing to engage in aggressive negotiation tactics. By considering these cultural nuances, a negotiator can tailor their approach to the specific context and build a stronger rapport with their counterpart.\n\nEstablishing a personal connection with the opposing party can also be a key factor in successful negotiation. By learning about their interests, motivations, and concerns, a negotiator can create a more empathetic and effective dialogue, leading to more constructive outcomes.",
            "The idea that a person can live their life with the conviction that there is no divine presence was first articulated in the Bible, specifically in Psalm 14, where it is attributed to the writings of the early Christian philosopher, St. Anselm. This sentiment is not unique to Anselm, as it is also echoed by the 13th-century scholar Thomas Aquinas. To compare their arguments effectively, we will assume that both authors are attempting to establish the existence of a higher power, one that is consistent with the biblical narrative. This assumption allows us to evaluate their approaches without straying from the core topic. While both thinkers present compelling arguments, a closer examination reveals that neither provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the nature of the divine.\n\nLet's begin by examining Anselm's perspective. He posits that the existence of a higher power can be discerned through introspection, suggesting that the notion of a divine presence is inherent within the human experience. According to Anselm, our understanding of the divine is not derived from external evidence, but rather from the internal workings of the human mind. This philosophical stance emphasizes the role of introspection in shaping our comprehension of the world, and it is this introspective approach that characterizes Anselm's concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more systematic approach, advocating for the use of reason and empirical evidence to demonstrate the existence of a higher power. This position has significant implications for the spread of religious ideas, as it allows for a more logical and evidence-based approach to conversion. Aquinas presents five distinct lines of reasoning that support the existence of a higher power, each of which relies on the principles of logic and causality. For instance, he argues that the presence of causality and the existence of degrees of excellence both point to the existence of a higher power that underlies the natural world.",
            "The formative period of Buddhism dates back to the early centuries of the Common Era, specifically to the 5th or 6th century BCE. It was during this time that a prince, who would later be revered as the Buddha, embarked on a transformative journey, relinquishing worldly attachments to attain profound enlightenment. This pivotal event gave rise to the Buddhist tradition, with Theravada Buddhism being the most influential strand. Spanning over two and a half millennia, the religion has undergone significant evolution, yielding distinct expressions. A testament to this change can be observed in Theravada-majority Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, reflecting the dynamic adaptation of Buddhist practices. This ceremony, participated in by both clergy and lay adherents, holds spiritual significance, despite not being explicitly outlined by the Buddha. This divergence from the original teachings underscores the fluid nature of Buddhist doctrine, encompassing both superficial customs and its core tenets.\n\nThroughout this analysis, several key terms will be employed. The internal versus external dichotomy will be particularly relevant. Here, an internal force refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status. Conversely, external forces originate from non-Buddhist sources. A hostile force is any influence that imperils or seeks to harm the Buddhist community, often rooted in a negative perception of the religion. In contrast, a benign force is one that neither aims to harm nor assist the community, although its outcomes may be either beneficial or detrimental byproducts.\n\nTo comprehend Theravada Buddhism, it is essential to delve into its foundational principles. The religion's core tenets revolve around the concept of the triple gem – the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. The Dharma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts classified into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, Vinaya Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka comprises the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the code of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including the concepts of Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these notions is crucial for breaking free from the cycle of rebirth, known as Sansara. Accomplishing this would mean transcending the three fundamental afflictions – lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes a set of guidelines for laypeople and monks alike, with laymen adhering to the five precepts (non-harming, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and abstention from intoxicants) and monks following a more extensive code of conduct. The four noble truths represent the fundamental doctrine of Buddhism, comprising the recognition of Dukkha, the acknowledgment that attachment leads to suffering, and the understanding that suffering can be overcome.",
            "A notable 57-year period of tension existed between the United States and Mexico, spanning from 1836 to 1893, according to historical accounts (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the United States successfully secured control over Texas and the American Southwest. This marked the culmination of numerous clashes between the two nations, which subsided on the eve of World War I. The rivalry's origins can be attributed to divergent views on matters such as faith, cultural identity, and historical tradition, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis phenomenon is not unique to the United States and Mexico; bordering nations frequently experience conflicts of interest that contribute to the development of adversarial relationships. The dynamics at play in this instance are reminiscent of other enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. As historian David M. Pletcher (1977) observed, the United States' long-standing diplomatic challenges with Mexico and Cuba are notable exceptions within the broader context of U.S.-Latin American relations (p. 41). The geographical proximity of these nations to the United States likely contributed to their historical rivalry, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed relatively cordial relations with the United States.\n\nA significant factor in the tension between the United States and Mexico was their differing stances on religion, a theme that has influenced the dynamics of numerous international conflicts throughout history. Historian Sally Frahm (2001) noted that, whereas Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they had previously opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries (p. 86). This ideological divide mirrored the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, albeit with a distinct focus on religious differences. The distrust between the English and Spanish empires had a lasting impact on the relationship between the United States and Mexico, as both nations inherited a legacy of animosity from their colonial past.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), a total of 17 disputes characterized the 57-year rivalry between Mexico and the United States. The majority of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into the United States and other border-related problems. The specter of bandits and outlaws from U.S. border towns posed a significant challenge that persisted until both nations exerted military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) attributed the eventual decline of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the United States, which altered the dynamics of their relationship (p. 109). As American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, the rivalry gradually dissipated in the latter part of the 19th century (p. 110).",
            "The life I knew was turned upside down fifteen years ago when a previously unknown condition rendered me severely incapacitated.  At the time, I was working as a nurse, a profession I had chosen in pursuit of stability and security, which I had lacked during my formative years. The repeated reassurances I received that 'there would always be work and people would always need medical care' led me to put aside my aspirations to become a scientist or journalist, opting for a more secure career path.\n\nNow, at 46, I am single, financially strained, and unable to work. Despite living on Social Security Disability for the past fifteen years, I have almost nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a constant assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty has become a defining feature of my life, yet one thing remains clear: I owe my ability to cope to the unwavering support of my loved ones and a few close friends. In times of true crisis, one's strength is often an illusion.\n\nMy point is that life is inherently unpredictable, and no amount of preparation can guarantee immunity to adversity. Despite the importance of being prepared, there are some challenges that can only be overcome with the help of others.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need for self-reliance, I firmly believe that Americans would be better off learning to trust and rely on each other, rather than relying solely on a faltering system. The conservative notion of 'rugged individualism' is an idealized concept that overlooks the role of community and mutual support in the face of adversity. The pioneers who braved the frontier did not succeed in isolation, but through collaboration and shared resources.\n\nWhile it is wise to be prepared, I encourage individuals to supplement their preparations with a deeper connection to their community. Build a disaster kit, learn basic first aid, and stock a cache of non-perishable food items. If possible, consider cultivating a small garden or preserving food for future use. However, do not overlook the value of building genuine relationships with your neighbors, who may become your most vital lifeline in times of need.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, with various constraints and limitations influencing its direction. Although pioneers like D'Arcy Thompson acknowledged the challenges of translating organic forms into mathematical language as early as 1917, the field has yet to fully unlock the secrets of morphological development. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have expanded our understanding of mollusk skeletogenesis, particularly in the context of ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum by integrating mathematical modeling, experimental studies, and X-ray imaging.\n\nWe utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995), allowing us to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change within the clade.\n\nThe shell can be thought of as a three-dimensional structure that evolves over time, with whorls forming a spiral pattern around a central axis. This axis, known as the columella, runs through the shell's central column. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, with each whorl separated by a continuous line, or suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the last. The apex, or tip, of the spire and the base of the shell are the two opposite ends, with the animal emerging through the aperture.\n\nShells can be visualized from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The apical view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is the standard orientation.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, with estimates rounded to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nThe shell's growth can be represented as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal adds new material. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can chart the trajectory of the aperture. This trajectory can be mathematically and graphically represented, allowing us to modify the parameters and simulate alternative skeletogenic pathways.",
            "A crucial analysis of Indonesia's progress toward the Millennium Development Goals reveals a paradoxical situation, where advancements in some areas coexist with stagnation in others. Notably, the country has been able to achieve significant strides in water and sanitation targets, yet the rates of improvement in child and maternal health remain sluggish. A closer examination of the underlying factors behind this disparity is necessary to inform the next course of action.\n\nDespite the commendable increase in births attended by skilled health professionals, such as doctors and nurses, the reliance on traditional practitioners like midwives raises concerns. These midwives often lack the necessary medical expertise to handle complications during childbirth, resulting in a substantial number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Consequently, the reported improvements in this area may be somewhat misleading, underscoring the need for more comprehensive healthcare coverage.\n\nFurthermore, there has been a concerning decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional. In addition, data on postnatal care is sparse, highlighting a pressing issue that warrants attention. The disparity in cesarean-section rates between urban and rural areas is another pressing concern, with rates hovering around 4% nationwide. In urban settings, the c-section rate is significantly higher at 7%, while in rural areas, it is a mere 2%. This stark contrast underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with a clear bias toward urban areas.\n\nAnother concerning aspect is the vertical inequity in service utilization, with a 27% gap in access to healthcare between the poorest and richest quintiles. This disparity is likely due to the high out-of-pocket costs associated with healthcare services, making it increasingly difficult for the poor to access essential medical care. The question now arises: what is the most effective approach to address the glaring gaps in neonatal and maternal care? Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system, prioritizing the well-being of mothers and children before and after pregnancy?\n\nWhile programmatic approaches may seem attractive due to their targeted objectives and rapid results, they also have drawbacks. Investing heavily in a particular area of the health sector can divert resources away from other essential areas, leading to a brain drain and duplication of services. The example of the HIV/AIDS program's impact on the family planning sector is a stark illustration of this phenomenon. Running multiple parallel programs can also result in administrative burdens, duplication of efforts, and inefficiencies in resource allocation.",
            "Charles Dickens' novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the social hierarchy of the time period.  However, his works \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" diverge from this tradition by incorporating elements of enigma and an affinity for the unconventional. These narrative departures enhance the complexity of the characters within each novel, offering a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional landscapes.\n\nThe following passage from Dickens exemplifies the unsettling and dreamlike quality that pervades these narratives: \"A cacophony of disorienting thoughts assaulted his mind as he continued to oscillate between Sikes and Crackit, who were vociferously disagreeing. The words they uttered seemed to reverberate within his ears, and when he finally regained his attention, he found himself conversing with them... Suddenly, the sound of gunfire pierced the air, and a chorus of cries and shouts erupted, accompanied by flashes of light, as he was hastily borne away by an unseen force. Amidst this ephemeral chaos, a vague, gnawing sense of pain persisted, tormenting him incessantly.\"\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests through the use of dream sequences or states of altered consciousness, serving to vary in function and content depending on the specific narrative context. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these events frequently provide insight into Oliver's inner world, revealing the sources of his distress and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28 illustrates Oliver's struggles to cope with his circumstances, as he relives the traumatic event in a dreamlike state while desperately seeking assistance. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of agency in the face of adversity, as well as the dire consequences for his physical well-being, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, rendering his senses numb, and he experiences his despair once more, now linked to a profound sense of fear rather than shock. As Oliver is overwhelmed, the question arises about the responsibility for his misfortune, suggesting that it was not his own doing. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has limited control over his circumstances, even in life-or-death situations, implying a growing sense of defeat and resignation.\n\nThe following passage from \"Wuthering Heights\" captures the atmosphere of desolation and timelessness that pervades the novel: \"The day passed – a fleeting moment – and was gone, lost in the darkness of night. Night seemed to stretch on forever, a seemingly endless expanse of silence, yet it was brief, a mere whisper of time.\"",
            "It's been a couple of years since I worked in an after-school program, where I tutored elementary school students in a variety of subjects. I concentrated on providing support in English and reading, as these were areas where I could make the most impact. One student, Adrian, who I believe was in the third or fourth grade at the time, stood out to me. He was struggling with reading, and I soon realized that there was something unusual about the way he approached the task. Certain letters were familiar to him, while others caused him significant difficulties. Adrian was of Latin American descent, and it was this that initially led me to suspect that language might be a factor in his struggles.\n\nHowever, this assumption was challenged when I met his mother, who spoke only Spanish. Despite our limited communication, it became clear that Adrian's issue wasn't related to language comprehension but rather to his understanding of the English alphabet. This realization sparked an important insight: even students who speak fluent English can still face significant obstacles when it comes to reading. This experience has stuck with me, and I believe it highlights the need for targeted support in schools, particularly in areas like California where language barriers are common.\n\nLanguage barriers in education are a complex issue, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. While the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes can all be effective tools, they should be used in conjunction with one another to create a comprehensive approach. In my view, the key to success lies in combining these different methods to meet the diverse needs of students.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, has shown promise. Studies have demonstrated that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about the financial implications and the potential benefit to only a subset of students, I believe that implementing this system more widely could have far-reaching benefits for all children. While it may not be feasible or practical to require all teachers to be bilingual, I think it's essential to provide bilingual support staff in schools, such as tutors or aids, to help bridge the language gap.",
            "The notion of a transcendent force beyond our mortal comprehension is a concept that permeates human existence from a tender age. It's an idea that is often explored in various contexts, whether through structured faith, introspection, or a blend of both. While some individuals readily conform to the spiritual traditions passed down through their families, others choose to reject them in favor of personal, unencumbered inquiry. This journey of self-discovery often involves navigating multiple value systems before settling on one that resonates with us. Our pursuit of meaning can be likened to seeking a guiding light in the darkness, a beacon that illuminates the path forward.\n\nA poignant moment of introspection occurred during a quiet evening on a rain-soaked porch with my father. He spoke of cardinals, his favorite bird, as the rhythmic beat of the raindrops created a soothing melody. His gaze, a mix of contemplation and reminiscence, seemed to transcend the present moment. His physical appearance had altered significantly over the preceding months, a reflection of the hardships he faced. I felt a mix of emotions – affection, apprehension, and a deep-seated fear of confronting the reality of his mortality. The tension between acknowledging and avoiding the inevitable was palpable.\n\nMy father passed away in December, shortly after my twenty-second birthday. The prolonged suffering, despite treatment, only added to the sense of urgency and desperation. The question of a higher power's benevolence echoed in my mind. I remember a moment of disillusionment, where I questioned the existence of a deity that seemed indifferent to human suffering. The silence was deafening, and I found myself struggling to connect with something I once believed in.\n\nIn an attempt to shield myself from the harsh reality, I chose not to witness his passing. It was a difficult decision, but I believed it was in line with my father's values and my own sense of dignity. The days that followed were a blur as I grappled with the loss. The anticipation of a phone call that never came only added to my sense of isolation.",
            "In a paradoxical sense, the term 'Gothic Novel' can be seen as a contradictory entity, encapsulating the fusion of antiquity and modernity, as posited by Ian Watt's seminal work The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has undergone a rollercoaster of perceptions, oscillating between being dismissed as superficial and lauded for its ability to evoke a sense of the sublime (as Burke astutely observed). Horace Walpole's inaugural 'Gothic Novel', The Castle of Otranto, ingeniously incorporated elements from both 'ancient' and 'modern' literary traditions, thus giving birth to the proto-Gothic genre. By blending 'old' theatrical conventions with the 'new' narrative structures of emerging novels, Walpole pioneered a unique literary style that he termed 'A Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval theatrical practices, architectural styles, and cultural heritage. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term 'gothic' was employed to describe a multitude of people, styles, and periods, often with a connotation of being outdated or unsophisticated in comparison to the rapidly evolving societal and literary landscape. The intriguing amalgamation of the theatrical 'Gothic' and the novel's innovative format, which allowed readers a more intimate glimpse into the psychological realm of characters, contributed to the genre's remarkable longevity and adaptability.\n\nOne of the pivotal elements of the Gothic novel is the notion of Chivalry, which permeates The Castle of Otranto and other works within the genre. The medieval ideal of chivalry, encompassing the development of a noble knight, serves as a recurring motif, both preserved and reinterpreted by Gothic writers, including Walpole. The reverence for the chivalric code, symbolizing bravery, honor, and competence, was especially significant to these authors, who perceived a growing disparity between the ideal and the reality of their own time. By incorporating chivalric ideals and mannerisms, the 'Gothic past' was romantically idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into Romanticism. In The Castle of Otranto, this is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, as described in the text:\n\nThe description of Frederic highlights a plethora of chivalric attributes; he is a prince, beset by a series of tragic events, and is assumed to have fallen to the infidels. The image of the gallant and courteous knight is, however, somewhat exaggerated, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "The seamless orchestration of goods from raw materials to customer delivery is what defines supply chain management. This intricate dance of processes was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a strategic consultant who recognized the importance of streamlining the entire process to meet customer needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management involves six pivotal components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These elements work in harmony to deliver unparalleled customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. It is here that production managers determine the optimal production plan, taking into account market trends and customer demand. Market analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences, allowing managers to make informed decisions about product offerings and quantities. The chosen production location must also be carefully selected, balancing factors such as volume and quality to meet customer expectations.\n\nEffective production planning is crucial, as it sets the tone for the entire supply chain. Scheduling and equipment maintenance are critical aspects of this stage, as any misstep can have far-reaching consequences for the company. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed meticulous processes for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This level of scrutiny ensures that expectations are clear and direction is unambiguous, allowing for a smooth workflow.\n\nSupply, the second essential element, involves strategic planning to optimize facility capabilities and partnerships. Companies may choose to outsource certain processes to external partners, leveraging their strengths to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality products with flexibility while minimizing costs. By carefully evaluating internal divisions and external collaborations, managers can create a robust supply chain that meets customer needs while maintaining a competitive edge.",
            "Amidst the bustle of a Southeast Asian nation, a poignant statement hangs above the head of a lone figure, a cinematic actor renowned for her portrayal of Juno. Ellen Page stands resolute, her cardboard sign emblazoned with a stark message scrawled in bold letters. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been under the iron-fisted grip of a military junta since 1962, its ascent to power marked by a coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests shook the nation, sparked by a decade-long period of relative calm. Led by a fraternity of Burmese monks clad in their distinctive saffron-robed attire, these protests garnered widespread attention and earned the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution.\" As the protests gained momentum, the government's initial concession to allow peaceful gatherings soon gave way to a vicious cycle of violence, with the military launching a brutal crackdown on monasteries and targeting foreign journalists, including the tragic killing of Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai in 2007. Official reports estimated 13 fatalities, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the military, painted a haunting picture of a much higher death toll, with numerous bodies estimated to be in the thousands.\n\nThis phenomenon is not an isolated incident, nor is it a recent development. The urge to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control has been a persistent thread throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were revered as deities, ushering in an era of prosperity – albeit one marked by ritualistic self-sacrifice and technological advancements. In more contemporary times, the United States has seen its fair share of authoritarian tendencies, including the presidency of George W. Bush, whose alleged connections to Ted Haggard, a prominent figure in the Republican Party, have raised eyebrows.\n\nHistorical precedents abound, such as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where a confluence of intellectuals, labor activists, and students came together to challenge the Chinese government's authoritarian regime. The death toll in this instance remains shrouded in uncertainty, with official reports ranging from 200 to 300, while independent estimates suggest a staggering 2,000 to 3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s is another harrowing example, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, disregarding ethnic affiliations. The atrocities perpetrated during Hitler's Third Reich, a period marked by the mass persecution and extermination of Jews, serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "One of the key factors contributing to Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is his remarkable longevity and the resultant mastery of his craft. As a composer, Ellington frequently achieved a harmonious balance between subtle piano work and the individual talents of his orchestra members. By crafting frameworks that allowed for improvisation, Ellington not only showcased each musician's capabilities but also generated a dynamic interplay of sounds that elevated the ensemble as a whole. His orchestral compositions often seamlessly integrated diverse styles, underscoring the versatility and cohesion of his band.\n\nA prime example of Ellington's innovative approach can be found in Creole Love Call, a piece that exemplifies his use of voice as a melodic instrument. This early work showcases his ability to incorporate vocals without the constraints of lyrics, effectively enriching the sonic tapestry. Throughout his career, Ellington demonstrated a distinctive sensitivity to the unique styles of his soloists, as evident in his collaborations with various musicians.\n\nCreole Love Call is a 12-bar blues piece characterized by six distinct sections, each contributing to the rich narrative. Section one features a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, which gradually transitions from a smooth tone to a more rugged quality. The second section presents a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the melody, punctuated by extended blue notes. The third section showcases a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nThe subsequent sections build upon this foundation, with the full band echoing the first chorus through a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections. The fifth section reaches a climactic conclusion, as the reeds take center stage with a call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final section returns to the initial structure, with the voice adopting the distinctive \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant flourish by a trombone. This utilization of voice as a tone color adds a unique dimension to Ellington's work, a trait consistently evident throughout his compositions.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly merges his skill in orchestration with his acute sense of tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing effectively combines the vocal and instrumental aspects of their performances. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further explores this concept, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's trombone to introduce the melody in a captivating manner.",
            "She had long been plagued by an inexplicable void, a gnawing sense of incompleteness that had taken hold around the time she entered adolescence. Three years had passed since that initial feeling had arisen, and yet, it persisted, refusing to be satiated. The nature of this yearning had evolved over time, shifting from a desire for a tangible object to a deep-seated need for human connection. However, her lack of interest in the boys who had shown interest in her had left her questioning her own emotional landscape.\n\nAs a teenager, she often found herself pondering the reasons behind this peculiar phenomenon, trying to unravel the tangled threads of her emotions. The years of introspection had yielded various theories, but none had provided a satisfactory explanation for her emotional state. As a result, she continued to navigate life with a sense of disquiet, her mind repeatedly returning to this enigmatic void.\n\nHer upbringing had been marked by a sense of tranquility, thanks to her parents' calm and harmonious relationship. Arguments were rare in her household, and when they did occur, they were usually centered around her desire for independence and self-expression. Her parents' peaceful nature had been a stark contrast to her own effervescent personality, which had earned her a reputation as a lively and endearing individual.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was jolted by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice was a stark contrast to the sound of distress that had pierced the air. She rushed into the kitchen, her heart racing with concern, and found her mother lying on the ground, writhing in pain. The daughter sprang into action, placing a supportive hand on her mother's shoulder as she exclaimed, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" Her mother's response was laced with urgency, \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to get me to the hospital.\" The daughter's eyes widened with worry as she quickly assessed the situation and sprang into action.\n\nWith her mother directing her, she carefully lifted her into a seated position and guided her to the car, where she carefully settled her into the backseat. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her mind consumed by the need to ensure her mother's well-being. Upon arrival, the antiseptic scent and cacophony of sounds created a disorienting atmosphere, but her daughter's primary concern remained her mother's health. She quickly called for the medical staff, who swiftly responded with a sense of urgency, and her mother was attended to.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had suffered a fall from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study focused on the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed), a modified version of the Mediterranean Diet, which emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and lower consumption of saturated fats and animal products. Moderate alcohol intake is also permitted.\n\nPrevious research has shown that adherence to the Mediterranean Diet is associated with a reduced risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. However, prior studies have not specifically examined the relationship between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke mortality. An earlier intervention trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean Diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles in obese individuals.\n\nThe present study involved 74,886 women aged 38-63 years, free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The women completed six food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) from 1984 to 2004, which assessed their dietary habits over the preceding year. The response rate was over 95% across the 20-year study period. FFQs were validated through external reviews of medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Cases of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through these records, with approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions classified as probable based on available information.\n\nAdditional variables, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy, were calculated for each FFQ. Leisure-time physical activity was also assessed, starting in 1986. To account for individual variability and long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the aMed score were calculated from the repeated FFQs.\n\nThe analysis controlled for potential confounders, such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to investigate the association between the aMed score and risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal events.\n\nThe results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the US economy hit a severe downturn, marked by a sharp increase in unemployment and a catastrophic collapse of the housing market. A significant number of major corporations suffered devastating losses, raising pressing questions about the causes and potential prevention of such a crisis. In essence, the financial debacle can be attributed to ill-conceived and short-sighted policy decisions that prompted banks and financial institutions to extend high-risk loans to consumers during a time of economic instability. Concurrently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac found themselves under intense pressure to invest in and repackage subprime mortgages as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the resulting financial strain was transferred to the repackaged securities, ultimately destabilizing the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration's efforts to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, the President relaxed lending regulations, potentially sowing the seeds of the subprime crisis that would materialize seven years later. A New York Times article from 1999 highlighted the issue, stating that Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, was facing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand its mortgage lending to low-income households while maintaining profitability. A prescient journalist, Steven Holmes, noted that this approach could lead to a government bailout similar to the one in the 1980s, predicting the severe economic consequences of such actions.\n\nA complex interplay of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the widespread adoption of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs. This web of financial instruments not only entwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market but also led to excessive leverage among US households and financial institutions. As a result, the economy became highly susceptible to even minor fluctuations in housing prices.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. In 2007, the top US investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. This led to the collapse of several major financial institutions, including Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt, prompting the government to take control in September 2008.",
            "The Art of Exposition: A Cautionary Tale\n\nFor writers, there exists a precarious balance between revealing the intricacies of a narrative and overwhelming the reader with unnecessary information. Dr. Emma Taylor dubs this crux the \"exposition conundrum.\" While attempting to guide readers through the labyrinth of backstory and details, writers often find themselves lost in a sea of exposition, only to have their audience grow disengaged.\n\nThe fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell\" is well-known, yet even seasoned writers like Dr. Taylor struggle to avoid lengthy passages that fail to advance the plot. Exposition, in essence, is the inclination to disclose significant information in a straightforward manner. This can manifest in the form of a character divulging an abrupt history lesson or the author itself taking the reins to convey crucial details.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, consider a narrative where a protagonist's husband is suddenly and tragically murdered. Rather than a meager two lines of dialogue, a more immersive experience would delve into the nuances of their relationship, allowing readers to empathize with the heroine's emotional response. A compelling character study of the husband, captured through his interactions, mannerisms, and dialogue, would not only enrich the narrative but also facilitate a deeper connection with the heroine. The audience would become invested in their fate, and, consequently, the story would gain depth.\n\nEffective exposition, therefore, requires a delicate balance between providing the essential framework of the narrative and crafting a rich tapestry of characters and their relationships. Writers must avoid the temptation to gloss over pivotal details, instead choosing to incorporate subtle hints and nuanced character development. This approach will not only captivate the reader but also prevent the narrative from devolving into a dry recitation of facts.\n\nAs a writer, one must resist the urge to rush through exposition, opting instead for a more considered approach. Take, for instance, the introduction of a new character. Rather than listing their extensive history, including their military background and personal aspirations, a more engaging method would be to gradually reveal these details through their actions, dialogue, and interactions. By doing so, the reader will become invested in the character's growth and development, much like the protagonist's journey.",
            "On August 13, 2011, I viewed two broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio. The first breaking news segment, which aired live that morning, centered on a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio. A local man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was taken into custody after allegedly stabbing his wife. Although the wife's name was not disclosed, her mug shot was briefly shown, and Hostettler's appearance was described in a straightforward manner. Given the story's developing nature, the two-minute coverage seemed proportionate.\n\nThe second story focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which resulted in the critical injury of an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers. The police investigation was ongoing, with no suspects identified at the time. The limited coverage of this story might have been due to various factors, including the circumstances surrounding the incident and the location. It's worth noting that crime stories involving individuals from diverse backgrounds often receive varying levels of attention in the media. This phenomenon is a pattern that I have observed over the years, where high-profile cases involving individuals from the majority demographic tend to receive more extensive coverage compared to those from minority groups.\n\nThe next segment reported on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Authorities provided details about the suspected incident location and the type of firearm used, which was a .22 caliber rifle. A $5,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe following story concerned weather forecasts for the upcoming weekend, with temperatures expected to range from the mid-to-low 80s. The brief coverage was likely intended to pique viewer interest and encourage continued viewing.\n\nAdditionally, a story about a robbery at a convenience store on Clime Road in Columbus was presented. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hooded sweatshirt, was still at large. It's worth noting that the emphasis on the perpetrator's appearance and skin tone seemed unusual.\n\nLastly, a segment highlighted the conviction of Rene Rodriguez, a prominent figure in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation that spanned from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence in years, the report mentioned 300 months. The inclusion of Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage seemed unnecessary, as it did not directly relate to the details of the case.",
            "The intricate, multifaceted relationship between brothers is a profound and often paradoxical bond. This connection is comprised of a complex array of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and a range of other conflicting sentiments. Brothers possess a unique understanding of one another, one that surpasses the comprehension of outsiders. This deep-seated connection allows them to see themselves reflected in their brother, fostering an unshakeable sense of self-awareness. The intensity of this bond is most evident in moments of desperation, when the true nature of their relationship is put to the test. The associated emotions can be both uplifting and devastating, carrying significant consequences that serve as a catalyst for growth and self-discovery.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the complex dynamics between two brothers, as they navigate a treacherous landscape of emotions. Their futile journey is marked by a poignant clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, ultimately resulting in a tragic confrontation. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's omniscient perspective, the novel masterfully conveys the intricate emotions and perspectives that shape the protagonist's actions.\n\nA pervasive undercurrent of pride drives the protagonist's decisions, from his initial desire for a capable sibling to his ultimate actions. His vision of a brother who could share in his adventures and experiences is shattered by the reality of his brother's physical limitations. The protagonist's frustration and disappointment are palpable, as he grapples with the harsh realities of his brother's condition. However, a glimmer of hope emerges when he recalls the child's smile, highlighting the depth of his emotional connection to his sibling. This nuanced portrayal reveals a complex emotional landscape, marked by both altruistic and self-serving motivations.",
            "The human brain functions as a complex information-processing system, capable of intricate cognitive operations. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to sophisticated, so too have the analogies used to describe its workings. Initially, it was likened to a writing surface, then to a papyrus scroll, followed by a codex, and most recently, to a computer. While these analogies offer a foundation for understanding, it's essential to recognize their limitations, as they can lead to oversimplifications and misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing commences with the sensory organs, which transmute physical stimuli into electrical signals. Sensory input, comprising touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, is repeatedly reworked by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black rectangle against a white backdrop, bottom-up processing aggregates fundamental information such as color, spatial orientation, and object boundaries to deduce that the shape is a box. Top-down processing, conversely, utilizes the decisions made during the bottom-up process to accelerate object recognition, allowing you to identify the shape as a distinct, self-contained entity – in this case, a black box – rather than a void or an indentation.\n\nOnce information has undergone a degree of processing, an attention filter determines its relative importance and allocates it to specific cognitive processes. As you look down at your shoes, for example, your brain processes each individual blade of grass, yet a healthy attention filter inhibits you from consciously perceiving them as distinct entities. In contrast, you might readily identify your name amidst background noise. The information processing pathway involves multiple stages, with attention modulating the results at every juncture.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first store it. There are several types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods suited to various types of sensory stimuli. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on visual appearance, phonetic properties, or semantic meaning. Subsequently, information must be maintained. Research on animal subjects suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained through an electrical signal that cycles through a specific sequence of neurons for a brief duration. The structure of certain proteins is hypothesized to maintain long-term memories.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized within the brain, each derived from various disciplines, including human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are connected based on their affinity and relatedness. For example, in this model, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so forth.",
            "In the dystopian society depicted in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, the convergence of technology and capitalist ideologies raises significant concerns. The novel's inhabitants prioritize communal interests over individual autonomy, with a focus on immediate gratification. From a young age, they are conditioned to pursue happiness without questioning the underlying social structure. This setup reveals the characters as pawns in a larger game, subject to the control of the World Controller, who dictates a single ideology.\n\nUpon analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens, it becomes apparent that Huxley critiques the emerging economic systems of his time. Key terms from Marxist theory, such as homogeny and reification, are embedded throughout the narrative, underscoring the author's apprehensions regarding the capitalist model. The concept of false consciousness is a particularly relevant example, as it illustrates how the masses are kept in the dark about their true economic relationships, preoccupied instead with personal gain.\n\nThe conditioning of the lower-class citizens, facilitated by hypnopædia, serves to reinforce this notion. Their desires are manipulated to prioritize consumption, indulgence, and materialism, effectively suppressing any awareness of the social hierarchy and their place within it. This manipulation is perpetrated by the World Controller, who maintains a grip on power through hegemony – the dominance of a particular group over others.\n\nThe novel's portrayal of social classes highlights the effects of capitalist oppression. The lower classes, exemplified by the Deltas and Gammas, are oblivious to their manipulation, while those in higher positions, including the Alphas and Betas, often acquiesce to their roles. Even characters like Bernard, who seem to be aware of the oppressive nature of the society, ultimately conform to their designated positions.\n\nThe novel's depiction of relationships is also noteworthy. The characters lack depth and individuality, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism erode human agency and emotional expression. Interactions between individuals are superficial, characterized by the objectification of women and a focus on physical appearance. The complacency of the societal classes towards their positions in the hierarchy further underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, as they prioritize conformity over autonomy.\n\nThe novel can be seen as a commentary on the ways in which capitalism can lead to a false sense of security among the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal norms. Huxley's critique of capitalism serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancements and the consequences of a society that values consumption above all else.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, I've grown accustomed to navigating the campus's vast expanse. Getting from one end of the campus to the other can be a significant undertaking, particularly for those residing in outlying dormitories. My own experience as a freshman, housed in East Halls, highlights the challenges of traversing the campus. The considerable distance to classes in the Willard building, situated near the heart of campus, often necessitated a 25-minute walk, sometimes longer if inclement weather prevailed in State College. Engaging in conversation with an alumnus, I learned that the area surrounding East Halls was once characterized by extensive vacant land. This open space has since been transformed into sports facilities, modern buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and nearby apartment complexes. As the university continues to expand, the difficulty of navigating the campus becomes increasingly pronounced. In this context, the bicycle emerges as a promising solution. However, a bike alone is insufficient; it requires regular use and a campus environment that accommodates the needs of cyclists.\n\nIn a conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling, I was struck by his sentiments: \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't trendy to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling offers unparalleled efficiency, allowing one to cover distances of up to 30 miles on a bowl of oatmeal and moderate exercise. As an off-campus resident, I've come to appreciate the benefits of cycling. Specifically, I reside in a location equidistant from the campus center as some on-campus dormitories. The decision to purchase a bike has been one of my most prudent choices this year. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, cycling can significantly reduce travel time to just 5 minutes, provided I pedal at a moderate pace. However, the most direct route to Thomas building, Pollock Road, can be challenging to navigate, regardless of mode of transportation. While walking offers its own set of advantages, I find myself too time-constrained to prioritize walking. Without my bike, walking would be my sole reliable option, requiring an additional 30-40 minutes each day. This translates to over two and a half hours per week, a considerable amount of time I can ill afford to dedicate to commuting. When considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and activities, the total time would be substantial, undermining my academic productivity."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Exploring the Complexities of Insomnia Through the Lens of Biological and Sociocultural Perspectives\n\nInsomnia, a widespread sleep disorder, can be understood through the interplay of biological and sociocultural factors. The biological model examines the genetic and physiological aspects of insomnia, while the sociocultural model delves into the environmental influences of demographics, socioeconomic status, and cultural background. This paper reviews existing research to understand how these models intersect and inform our understanding of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with mental health conditions, and sleep disorders related to medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias including insomnia and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy, characterized by cataplexy and automatic REM behavior, is also part of this category. Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve sleep-related behavioral or physiological abnormalities, such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking.\n\nResearch suggests that the biological model of sleep disorders is centered around the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiological mechanisms. A study utilizing mouse models found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. The use of GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, has been shown to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This research has implications for understanding the genetic and environmental basis of sleep disorders in humans and suggests that alterations in the GABAB receptor may contribute to insomnia.\n\nFrom a sociocultural perspective, the findings of this study have significant implications. If the GABAB receptor's phenotype is inherited, it may influence sleep patterns, and alterations to this receptor could disrupt sleep, leading to negative consequences in daily life, such as impaired cognitive function and reduced productivity. This highlights the importance of considering the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in understanding insomnia and developing effective treatments.",
            "Auditory processing disorders can have a profound impact on individuals' daily lives. In this paper, we will delve into the intricacies of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the brain's ability to process sound information. We will examine the definition of CAPD, its diagnosis, and provide practical advice on how educators can support students with this condition in a mainstreamed classroom setting.\n\nCAPD is a neurological disorder characterized by the brain's impaired ability to interpret and process auditory information. Unlike hearing loss, which affects the ear's ability to detect sound, CAPD is a disorder of the central nervous system. People with CAPD can hear sounds with normal clarity, but their brains have difficulty distinguishing between background noise and meaningful sounds, or differentiating between multiple auditory stimuli.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has been around since the mid-20th century, when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" Since then, various tests have been developed to assess and diagnose the condition. For instance, the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of auditory tests in the 1950s, while the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association notes that the work of Kimura in the 1960s laid the groundwork for understanding the neural basis of auditory processing.\n\nThose affected by CAPD may exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between similar sounds, recognizing patterns, and detecting changes in speech tone or pitch. They may also struggle to filter out background noise or prioritize relevant auditory information. Furthermore, their brains may have difficulty processing sequential auditory information, which can lead to confusion and difficulty following conversations.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a combination of observational assessments and standardized tests. These evaluations typically involve observing the individual's listening behaviors, as well as their performance on tasks that assess auditory processing skills. While there is no single test that can definitively diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation can help identify the underlying challenges and develop targeted interventions.\n\nIn the following sections, we will examine the practical implications of CAPD in a mainstreamed classroom setting and provide guidance on how educators can support students with this condition.",
            "The play Twelfth Night presents a complex exploration of deception and its consequences, raising questions about the delicate balance between self-preservation and social relationships. Deception, particularly in the guise of gender role reversal, can be a double-edged sword: while it may initially provide a means of protection, it ultimately risks alienating the individual from their support network and forcing them to confront the consequences of their actions.\n\nViola's situation serves as a prime example of this dilemma. Disguising herself as a man allows her to navigate a foreign land safely, but it also creates a disconnect with the women around her and leads to complications with her own emotional desires. Her portrayal as Cesario sparks confusion, not only for Olivia but also within herself, as she grapples with suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino. The dynamics between these characters highlight the tension between authenticity and deception, making it difficult to discern what is genuine and what is a performance.\n\nIn examining the theme of deception, Twelfth Night also touches on the idea that it can be a catalyst for the revelation of suppressed emotions. The relationships between Olivia, Cesario/Viola, and Orsino are characterized by a web of unexpressed desires and conflicting feelings, which are brought to the surface through the complex web of deceptions. While Olivia's swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian may suggest that her initial attachment was superficial, it also raises questions about the nature of her desires and the extent to which they are influenced by societal norms.\n\nShakespeare's portrayal of Olivia, in particular, can be seen as a commentary on the superficiality of appearances and the tendency to judge others based on surface level characteristics. Her character's ease in switching between romantic interests and familial relationships serves as a commentary on the fluidity of human emotions and the impact of societal expectations on our understanding of ourselves and others.\n\nUltimately, Twelfth Night presents a nuanced exploration of the consequences of deception and the complexities of human relationships, leaving the audience to ponder the trade-offs between authenticity and self-preservation.",
            "The legacy of German colonial rule in various regions has been characterized by notable brutality, exemplified by the tragic events of the Ovaherero and Nama genocides in German South West Africa. A more nuanced understanding, however, is necessary to fully grasp the complexities of this colonial empire, which exhibited a multiplicity of policies and governing styles across its vast territories. Educational systems, for instance, demonstrated a considerable degree of diversity, with marked differences in approach and emphasis from one colony to another.\n\nUpon assuming control of German East Africa (present-day Tanzania) in 1919, British authorities found a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. This was in stark contrast to the situation in German Kamerun and other colonies, where German efforts to establish a robust educational framework were widely acknowledged by contemporary observers. The dichotomy between German East Africa and South West Africa (present-day Namibia) is particularly striking. In the former, government-sponsored institutions played a significant role in the education of local populations, whereas in the latter, missionary organizations bore the primary responsibility for educating natives, with government support being relatively limited.\n\nGovernment investment in European education in South West Africa was substantial, with a network of state schools and a more detailed system of regulation and support for missionary institutions. The long-term consequences of these educational policies persisted long after the end of German rule. Unlike other German colonies, which boasted a considerable proportion of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, with an overwhelming majority of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate. This discrepancy is attributed to a multifaceted array of social, economic, and political factors. This paper aims to augment existing research by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans and exploring the implications of their perspectives.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is extensive and diverse, with a significant proportion of sources written in German during the early 20th century. These early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems of individual colonies. Later studies, often written in English, expanded the scope of the discussion through comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth investigations of specific aspects of education. Notable among these studies is Cohen's comparative examination of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which highlights the factors contributing to the differences between the two colonies. Cohen suggests that the significant settler population in South West Africa played a pivotal role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively temperate climate, despite its arid desert regions, attracted a substantial European population, with approximately 15,000 settlers residing in the territory by 1913. This was significantly higher than the number of settlers in the colony with the next largest population, East Africa, where only around 5,336 settlers resided. The demographic composition of the region had a profound impact on the development of local educational systems and continues to influence the region's social and economic landscape to this day.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has been a dynamic and multifaceted process, resulting in an astonishing array of genres that defy easy categorization. The proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within these categories has further complicated the landscape, with many styles, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, branching out into distinct and innovative offshoots. Among these, heavy metal has emerged as a particularly expressive and diverse genre, marked by a predilection for the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy metal's versatility has allowed it to incorporate a wide range of themes and influences, giving rise to a dizzying array of niches and sub-niches that have evolved over the past four decades. This proliferation has led to a situation where it is increasingly difficult to define the genre, which has incorporated elements from various styles while retaining its core identity. To fully grasp the metal music that permeates contemporary music scenes, it is essential to understand the underlying ethos and historical context of the heavy metal movement.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is characterized by a distinctive aesthetic of excess – more intensity, more volume, more theatricality, and more complexity. Skilled musicianship is a hallmark of the genre, with many metal bands showcasing their technical prowess through intricate instrumentation. Additionally, the genre has been shaped by its association with substance use, particularly in the 1970s, when psychedelic experimentation led to the creation of innovative and otherworldly sounds. The incorporation of dark, visceral qualities, reminiscent of the Romantic Era, has also contributed to the genre's distinctive character.\n\nThe influence of these elements can be seen in the work of pioneering bands, such as the Beatles, who pushed the boundaries of heavy music with songs like \"Helter Skelter.\" This influential track, often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, was a response to the Rolling Stones' darker sound and a demonstration of the Beatles' ability to tackle more intense themes. The song's incorporation into the Beatles' landmark album, The White Album, marked a significant moment in the development of heavy metal.",
            "Henri Rousseau's artistic journey, spanning several decades prior to the emergence of the Surrealist movement, was marked by a unique blend of literal and figurative dreamscapes. His painting, 'The Dream,' created in 1910, serves as a poignant representation not only of a woman enthralled by the wonders of a dream world but also of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he grappled with a profound internal conflict: the desire for recognition and acceptance by the art world, which he deeply admired, versus the need to remain true to his artistic vision and creative independence.\n\nTo fully appreciate the significance of 'The Dream,' it is essential to understand the circumstances that shaped Rousseau's life and artistic trajectory. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a town in northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Despite his father's social standing, Rousseau's early life was marked by a lack of formal artistic training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll service employee, known as a gabelou, for nearly four decades, earning the informal title of douanier, customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau with a single child, Julia, and a profound sense of sorrow. He found solace in painting, which became a source of comfort and a means to start anew.\n\nIn contrast to his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class, Rousseau's work reflects the hopes and dreams of the common man. His struggle to gain recognition in the art world, particularly during a time when many talented and well-established artists, including Matisse, were active, is understandable given his late start and limited formal training. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's motivation to create conventional art was driven by a desire to be accepted into the prestigious Artiste Français, whereas Matisse sought to avoid clichéd representations in his work. Rousseau's dual aspirations – to be acknowledged by the art world while staying true to his artistic voice – are poignantly captured in 'The Dream,' a painting that continues to captivate audiences with its poignant blend of artistic expression and personal longing.",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has long been a subject of contemplation among thinkers. It's a notion that resonates deeply, one that has been echoed by visionaries such as John Keats, who so elegantly phrased it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The truth is that much of our understanding is shaped by education and experience, yet we intuitively grasp the essence of beauty and morality without explicit instruction. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate, and our exploration of morality and beauty is an attempt to unravel the enigma of what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action morally sound, rather than establishing a set of rules for evaluation or creation. \n\nWhat's more, criticism of art or morals often falls short of capturing the true essence of goodness or beauty. A discussion about, for example, the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into concepts like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these aspects merely scratch the surface. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morality defy reduction to a comprehensive description of their qualities. As the astute author Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics possesses this elusive quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this enigmatic aspect is art and morality's most compelling attribute, and that their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nIt's striking that we experience both ethics and aesthetics at a profound, almost ineffable level, which the philosopher Immanuel Kant would call noumenal. They touch us on a plane that can be felt, but not fully articulated. This connection is especially evident in literature, where the moral dimension is integral to its essence. As philosopher Ian McKean insightfully pointed out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are less relevant to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern landscape is a testament to its robust identity, forged from a rich tapestry of regional influences that stretch from the Alpine foothills to the Baltic coast. This diversity is palpable in the unique cultural nuances of cities like München, Köln, and Dresden, each with its own distinct character. The country's history is a complex tapestry woven from the threads of multiple ancestral groups, their origins shrouded in mystery and subject to ongoing scholarly debate.\n\nThe term \"Germania\" evokes the ancestral homeland of the German people, but its etymology remains a topic of heated discussion among historians and linguists. Some attribute the name to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, while others point to the word \"germanus,\" first employed by Julius Caesar in his commentary on the Gallic Wars. Caesar, in his observations on the Gallic Wars, noted the Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine, and used the term to distinguish those he had conquered from those he had not. The Gauls, it is believed, borrowed the word from their own language, using it to describe their neighbors.\n\nCaesar's writings in the first book of his Commentarii de Bello Gallico provide insight into the Germanic tribes: \"Those who reside beyond the Rhine, with whom they are constantly at war...They engage in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) The etymology of \"Germania\" has been the subject of various theories, including a possible connection to the spear, known as a \"ger,\" or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout.\" This could suggest that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature.\n\nTacitus, in his seminal work \"De Origine et Situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, portrays the Germans as a distinct people, untouched by external influences: \"I would regard them as indigenous, unmixed with other races through immigration or intermarriage. For those who sought to emigrate would arrive by sea, not by land...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy, for Germany, with its harsh climate, its unforgiving skies, its severe demeanor, unless it were their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98) The Romans, while extending their dominion over Germania, seemed reluctant to settle within its borders, preferring to maintain their influence through military campaigns and trade. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their military prowess as soldiers in the Roman army.

            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted down, my mind hovering in a state of mental stillness. The scene before me was a kaleidoscope of stimuli, yet my consciousness processed it with an almost detached objectivity. My thoughts darted in and out of my awareness with the speed of a whispered secret, leaving no lasting impression. It was as if my mental state was a fluid, ever-changing entity, unencumbered by the weight of personal interpretation.\n\nMy interest in drawing began at an early age, and I had been drawn to the idea of understanding the underlying mechanisms of perception. This led me to read \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" an art instruction book that offered a comprehensive guide to the fundamentals of visual representation. One technique that resonated with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying the complexity of the world into a manageable, two-dimensional plane.\n\nAs I stood in front of the bowl, I found myself unable to apply this concept. The overwhelming richness of the scene held me in its grasp, and I was left transfixed, a captive of its beauty. I thought of the great masters – Picasso's blue period, Monet's lush landscapes, and the Renaissance artists' mastery of color. If I were to venture into the realm of artistic expression, this moment might be the start of my journey, a blank canvas waiting for my brushstrokes.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and with a subtle tension, I began to create. The movement was almost meditative, my mind channeling its will into the physical act of drawing. The water in the bowl seemed to swirl and shimmer, its calm surface reflecting the turmoil brewing within me. But my creative energy was short-lived, as my hand jerked back, my fingers tightening around the pencil handle. The seemingly inert mass of brown matter, stuck to the underside of the toilet, defied my artistic intent. I stood there, my emotions simmering beneath the surface, as I gazed at the unyielding, uncooperative \"art piece.\"\n\nI stood up straight, and with a growing sense of purpose, my hand grasped the toilet paper roll, its cardboard core digging gently into my palm. The sheets rustled softly as I wrapped them around my hand, a makeshift mitt that would protect me from the unyielding mass before me. Slowly, I leaned forward, my hand dipping into the bowl, a deliberate, almost ceremonial gesture, as if I were about to retrieve a sacred relic from the depths of the earth.",
            "Youthful drivers are consistently prone to high-risk behavior behind the wheel.  This problem stems from a multifaceted set of factors. Research has shown that the adolescent brain is not sufficiently developed to fully grasp the complexities of driving, a notion supported by the National Institutes of Health. Furthermore, a lack of driving experience is a significant contributor to accidents, as novice drivers are more likely to engage in reckless behavior such as speeding and loss of control, resulting in a higher incidence of rollovers and collisions. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of peers in the vehicle increases the likelihood of accidents. A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.  In an effort to mitigate these risks, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely temporary solutions to a more fundamental issue.\n\nThe key issue lies in the inherent limitations of young drivers, as evidenced by statistical data. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that young people, particularly those under 19 or 20, are more inclined to engage in risk-taking behavior due to a desire for thrills. To address this, it may be wise to delay the issuance of full driver's licenses until this tendency has diminished. Continuously granting licenses to young teens will only perpetuate a cycle of fatal accidents, and the consequences may be catastrophic, especially as the baby boom generation's offspring will soon be entering the driving population.\n\nLegislative action could involve a nationwide approach. Schools could continue to offer driver education courses to prepare future drivers, but individuals under the age of 18 would be prohibited from operating a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full license, accompanied by a set number of required practice hours, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult, as seen in California. A uniform national standard would be an effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country.\n\nThis proposal is not an innovative concept, but a sound approach to addressing the pressing issue of youthful driving fatalities.",
            "Browsing through the vast repository of early Edison films housed at the Library of Congress, I opted to explore a select group of 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films predominantly utilized innovative editing techniques to craft convincing illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles governing the majority of trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that distinguished a few of the later entries. \n\nGenerally, trick films produced during the turn of the century adhered to a distinct set of conventions: they were studio-bound, confined within a rigid proscenium framework, featured static camera positions, and relied on long and medium shots, all of which were bound by the rule of one shot per film. However, a few films from the early 20th century began to experiment with this paradigm by introducing multiple shots.\n\nA notable commonality among trick films was their use of an interior set situated within the confines of a proscenium frame. The camera remained fixed in its position, failing to pan or track subjects or objects within the scene. This composition drew its inspiration from the theater and, more specifically, the conventions of vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation inherent in the use of the stage was the restricted movement of figures within the frame, which typically confined actors to lateral motion, preventing them from advancing or retreating towards the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move horizontally, only to disappear from view without the camera following.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also led to an emphasis on long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups were notably absent from the Edison catalog of trick films, a nod to the theatrical tradition where audiences would observe the entire performance within a framed stage. In line with conventions of early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, thus precluding the use of close-ups. \n\nMost trick films from the period adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot per film, resulting in a typical length of one minute or less, contingent on the frame rate employed. This restriction also limited the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and substitution acts, devoid of a cohesive narrative. However, a closer examination of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between physical shots and perceived shots. Specifically, a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple joined shots, skillfully crafted to create the illusion of a seamless, magical transition.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an impassioned advocate of Republicanism, whose career as an agriculturalist and brief foray into politics forged a life defined by unwavering dedication and unflinching outspokenness on the principles of individual liberty and governance. His deep-seated commitment to an agrarian way of life served as the bedrock for his philosophical stance on the role of government, which he sought to maintain and promote as the foundation for a robust society.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to establish an exemplary system of government, unencumbered by the legacy of a native tradition. This enabled the country's founders to craft a system of self-governance that would prioritize the intrinsic rights of citizens, which he believed were interconnected and mutually dependent. The denial of one right would undermine the integrity of the entire set of rights, diminishing their value. Consequently, he contended that these fundamental rights should remain beyond the reach of government overreach.\n\nIn his vision for an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must balance the inherent duality of human nature, recognizing both the capacity for good and evil. He subscribed to a strict dualism, arguing that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Taylor's conception of good governance emphasized the protection of private property, agricultural advancement, and the discouragement of unchecked capitalism. He believed that a government founded on these principles would operate equitably, even with administration by individuals driven by self-interest – a trait he deemed universal among humans, but only problematic when it led to the exploitation of others. A judicious government was necessary to harness human nature's darker aspects, while vigilantly monitoring the introduction of corrosive influences.\n\nTaylor, like many fellow Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, championing an extremely limited federal government with powers strictly defined by the document's explicit text. He recognized that a large federal government would be prone to despotism due to its expense. However, he cautioned that a literalist approach could be perilous, as it might ignore the intent of the Constitution's authors, leading to distortions and corruption. Furthermore, Taylor regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundational document of the United States, as it explicitly articulated the nation's character as a collective of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon reviewing the data presented in Figure 17, it is noteworthy that a significant decline in commuter log submissions occurred during the third month of the project. Several factors could have contributed to this decrease. For instance, the onset of winter at a New England campus often leads to a reduction in alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles and walking, as the weather becomes increasingly inclement. Additionally, the end of the fall semester in December is a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with completing coursework, receiving grades, and winding down for the holiday season. Consequently, the commuter log may have fallen by the wayside for many individuals. Furthermore, the university's holiday break and subsequent closure of campus for an extended period may have also impacted participation.\n\nNotably, the commencement of the spring semester in late January did not rectify the issue, suggesting that factors beyond seasonal fluctuations may be at play. It is possible that the project's initial enthusiasm and participation waned over time, a phenomenon not unique to this initiative. In an effort to counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign designed to reignite interest and stimulate increased log submissions, which ultimately succeeded in achieving this goal.\n\nOne of the primary challenges encountered was maintaining momentum in the face of predictable dips in engagement, particularly during semester breaks and the holiday season. Another hurdle is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving and the freedom it affords. To address this, we implemented an incentive system, offering prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and retailers. While the rewards were well-received initially, it is intriguing to consider whether more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or alternative fuel vehicles, might have had a greater impact on participation. Exploring this variable could have provided valuable insights into the project's dynamics and potentially mitigated the observed decline in engagement. A key takeaway is that offering escalating rewards over time may have helped sustain interest and participation throughout the project.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer an alternative to traditional index funds and individual stock investments, providing diversification and flexible trading options. One of the key benefits of ETFs is their ability to track a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets, while also allowing for short selling, margin buying, and low minimum share requirements. Notably, ETFs have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund, making them an attractive option for investors. However, it's essential to consider the associated trading commissions, which can be a drawback. The ETF market offers a wide range of investment portfolios, and investors should carefully evaluate the benefits and potential drawbacks of each.\n\nIn this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF, examining its top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of the fund's assets. By analyzing these holdings, we aim to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. Additionally, we will investigate whether alternative configurations of these stocks could provide a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we will concentrate on the top 10 holdings, rather than the entire ETF portfolio. The holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets are presented below. We will then use this information to estimate the potential performance of a portfolio consisting of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF.\n\nThe results of our analysis indicate that a portfolio comprising the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return (6.11%) and lower beta (-0.12) compared to the ETF IHF. However, it is essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this question, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing the values to facilitate comparison with the ETF's standard deviation. This analysis will help us determine whether the differences in performance between the two portfolios are statistically meaningful.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's poems often regarded as a standout work is \"Dream-Land.\" A notable aspect of this poem lies in Poe's use of the term \"Thulé,\" which appears in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott, this term is linked back to the Roman poet Virgil, who employed it to describe an island situated north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the ancient Greeks.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the term \"Thulé\" may also be associated with a more contemporary source, given Poe's evident affinity for German literature. In fact, Poe's interest in the works of German authors, including notable writers such as Goethe, is well-documented.\n\nA quote from Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights the similarity between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's literary style, suggesting a possible influence. Specifically, Arndt observes a striking resemblance between Poe's poem and Goethe's \"Faust,\" a celebrated poetic drama published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing.\n\nWithin \"Faust,\" a smaller poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" is embedded in the second part. This poem tells the story of a king whose wife passes away, gifting him a goblet before her death. Consumed by grief, the king becomes a recluse, resorting to excessive drinking and ultimately decides to take his own life, bequeathing his possessions to his children and discarding the goblet into the ocean. A similar air of desolation and despair pervades Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" which echoes the temperament and magnanimity of the King of Thulé.\n\nInterestingly, a stage adaptation of \"Faust\" was composed by H.P. Gratton in 1842, mere months before Poe's own use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule not once, but twice in his collected works, employing \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and book-ending \"Dream-Land\" with it. This could be seen as a nod to Goethe's \"Faust\" and its companion piece, \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nUpon closer examination, it becomes clear that \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share striking similarities. Both poems explore the themes of isolation, loss, and a world devoid of vibrancy, evoking a sense of melancholy that permeates both works. Furthermore, Goethe's influence on Poe cannot be understated, given the latter's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who was well-acquainted with Goethe's work. Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is also evident in the numerous reproductions and adaptations of his works that were prevalent during Poe's time.",
            "In the event of an individual suffering harm after slipping and falling on a spill in a grocery store, they may be eligible to receive punitive damages if the store manager demonstrated a reckless disregard for the consequences of their inaction. This could potentially be the case if the manager was informed of the spill and chose not to address it due to personal obligations, specifically eating dinner, while being aware of previous incidents involving similar accidents.\n\nA court is unlikely to dismiss a claim for punitive damages without further consideration. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant's actions were taken with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm they could cause and were considered despicable. In this instance, Jennifer Palmer may argue that Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the consequences of not cleaning the spill, given the multiple previous incidents of slips and falls in the store. Furthermore, despite this knowledge, he failed to take action to rectify the situation.\n\nPalmer's argument that Martin's actions can be characterized as despicable is not entirely convincing, but it is still a plausible argument. This is particularly evident given the six slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009 and the failure of the manager to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, notified his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. However, Martin declined to address the issue, stating that he was on a dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, to which he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five separate slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the court is considering whether to grant a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty that does not arise from a contractual obligation if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California's Civil Code states that malice is characterized as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is despicable and carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have determined that conduct is malicious when it involves a deliberate disregard for the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant is aware of the potential dangers of their actions and willfully ignores them. This was the case in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, where the court ruled that a defendant's actions were malicious due to their conscious disregard for the consequences of their behavior.",
            "It has been nearly four years since I took a course in Islamic studies at a local institution. Our class discussions often centered around the perception of Islam in modern society, with some classmates questioning whether the religion is inherently hostile. This debate seems more pressing now than ever, particularly in light of recent global events. Observing the shift in media narratives on Islam from a predominantly negative to excessively tolerant stance following the 9/11 attacks has been striking. It is intriguing to consider how a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim connection, such as Barack Obama, could have gained traction in American politics.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a thought-provoking subject for me. Contrary to my initial understanding, his life story diverges significantly from the image of a ruthless conqueror who imposed his faith upon others. Instead, the biography portrays Muhammad as a complex, compassionate individual who was often misunderstood and humbled by his experiences. According to the narrative, his message resonated with individuals who were drawn to his wisdom and conviction, rather than through coercion.\n\nNotably, there are parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad. For instance, the account of multiplying food to feed a group of people bears a striking resemblance to similar stories in the Christian scriptures. This narrative device, used to emphasize Muhammad's humility and reliance on divine guidance, raises questions about the nature of truth and the role of miracles in both faith traditions. While the intention may have been to humanize Muhammad, it inadvertently downplays the unique significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nAnother aspect of the biography that struck me was the emphasis on testimonials and conversions. The stories, often relayed through secondary sources, seem designed to provide anecdotal evidence of the Prophet's impact. However, this approach creates a sense of detachment and raises concerns about the reliability of these accounts.\n\nWhat unsettles me most about this biography is the effort to portray Muhammad as a paragon of virtue, embodying qualities such as compassion, wisdom, and gentleness. Historical accounts, however, often contradict this image, leaving me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the complexities and nuances of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The trajectory of Christian thought in the immediate aftermath of Jesus' life reveals a gradual departure from its foundational principles.  Observing this historical narrative in broad strokes, we notice a progressive divergence from the original teachings of Jesus.  Despite the persistence of traditionalists who cling to established dogma, their influence is unlikely to be decisive in shaping the broader trajectory of Christian thought.  A growing awareness of historical context will undoubtedly gain momentum in the years to come, prompting a renewed interest in discerning the authentic essence of Christianity from the accretions that have accumulated over time.  As this awareness spreads, it will become increasingly evident that a profound shift is underway, one that will ultimately lead to a return to the fundamental principles that Jesus embodied.  This reversal of the trend in Christian history will unfold gradually, with the removal of extraneous doctrines, layer by layer, as if time itself is rewinding.  The end result will be a reclamation of the core teachings of Jesus, stripped of the varnish of later interpretations.  As this process takes hold in the Western world, we can expect to see a more unified and homogeneous Christian practice emerging, with the church serving as a guiding force.  This phenomenon is not unique to Christianity; human history is replete with examples of reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a pagan state to a Christian institution, and the progression from African-American slavery to African-American leadership in the United States.  A similar reversal is likely to occur within Christianity, driven by a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' teachings as metaphorical rather than literal.  To grasp the scope of this transformation, we must first examine the antecedents of Christianity.  The Hebrew scriptures, which formed the bedrock of Jewish thought by the time the Romans seized control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., reveal a complex and multifaceted tradition.  The Jewish population was not monolithic, comprising various factions such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common folk.",
            "The notion that individuals are inherently self-serving and egocentric is a pervasive theme in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. This notion is exemplified through the actions of the factory owners and managers who prioritize profit over the well-being of their employees and the environment. Their relentless pursuit of expansion and wealth is depicted as callous and devoid of empathy, as exemplified by the stark image of the factory buildings and the pollution they produce. Sinclair's vivid description of the smoke billowing from the chimneys serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating impact of industrialization on the community.\n\nThe exploitation of workers by their employers is another key aspect of the novel. The owners and managers demonstrate a ruthless disregard for their employees' welfare, pushing them to work excessive hours without adequate compensation or support. The lack of regulatory frameworks in place during the era allowed these practices to thrive, forcing workers to endure hazardous conditions and grueling working hours. The narrative implies that the working class was expected to accept these circumstances, with little to no recourse or assistance available to them.\n\nThe notion of workers as slaves is a powerful metaphor used to convey the extent of their exploitation. The formation of unions, intended to provide a voice for workers, often ended up exacerbating their situation, profiting from their struggles. The novel paints a bleak picture of a system that perpetuates immorality and oppression, with the workers' circumstances eerily mirroring those of enslaved individuals under the system of chattel slavery.\n\nIn this context, Sinclair's work serves as a scathing critique of the social and economic systems of his time, highlighting the need for reform and greater accountability. By shedding light on the darker aspects of industrialization, The Jungle encourages readers to confront the harsh realities of exploitation and to advocate for change.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald employs various literary techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby to elicit distinct responses from his readers. Among these techniques, the use of juxtaposition and symbolism stands out for its effectiveness. By pairing seemingly incongruous words and imbuing symbols with meaning, Fitzgerald creates a rich tapestry of emotions and associations. The author's utilization of color symbolism is a notable example of this technique. He repeatedly associates specific colors with particular connotations, often leveraging these associations to convey deeper meaning.\n\nIn the novel, Fitzgerald establishes a nuanced relationship between the colors white and gray. Initially, these colors are presented as polar opposites, with white signifying elegance and refinement, while gray connotes a sense of age and faded grandeur. Fitzgerald sets the stage for this dichotomy early on, depicting characters and settings clad in white, such as Nick's \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party and Tom's \"white shirt\" during his encounter with Myrtle. The exception to this rule is Nick's experience of Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors,\" suggesting a departure from the typically uniform presentation of white.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces the meanings he has assigned to these colors by applying them to everyday, mundane subjects. For instance, the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable serve to underscore the uniformity and conformity of these environments. Additionally, Fitzgerald uses these colors to describe people and places that are plain or unremarkable, such as the \"gray child\" in the railroad and the \"gray old man\" who sells dogs.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of these colors, Fitzgerald begins to use them to convey a sense of lackluster or uniformity, particularly in the context of Daisy Buchanan. Following a period of relative absence from these colors, Daisy is reintroduced wearing a \"white roadster,\" which subtly shifts the reader's perception of her from a fully fleshed-out character to a more diminished, uniform presence. This technique is reinforced by subsequent descriptions of Daisy, such as the \"gray haze of her fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "In the southernmost part of California, San Diego County boasts a prime agricultural location, characterized by a benign climate with ample sunlight. The region's farmland is home to a diverse range of crops, including leafy greens, broccoli, squash, tomatoes, citrus fruits, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, and various types of peppers. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is substantial, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic dairy and eggs are also highly sought after, with several local farms offering tours and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching on their premises. This type of operation presents an opportunity for landowners to participate in government programs while enhancing the natural habitat, allowing for tourism and educational initiatives.\n\nWhile organic farming offers several benefits, including increased biodiversity and reduced chemical usage, it also comes with higher operational costs. Organic farming requires more labor-intensive practices, such as hand-weeding and manual fertilization, which can lead to greater losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often struggle to achieve the same level of efficiency as larger commercial operations. Furthermore, certain conservation practices, like planting cover crops and invasive species removal, can also increase labor costs.\n\nThe chosen property, situated adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is a 160-acre parcel of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the area is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered and declining species. The land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. This specific parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo create a realistic model for a small farmer in this area, I researched government programs and chose a piece of property from a real estate website. A nearby organic farm serves as an example of what a landowner might aim to achieve, balancing economic viability with wildlife conservation.",
            "Effective negotiation is heavily influenced by the cultural context in which it takes place. Culture is a complex and multifaceted entity, often defined by its nuances and subtleties rather than its explicit characteristics. Statements that attempt to generalize an entire culture can be misleading and oversimplify its intricacies, such as labeling an entire nation as \"stubborn\" or \"accommodating.\" A more productive approach is to focus on the specific cultural attitudes and values that are relevant to the negotiation, as these will have a direct impact on the dynamics of the conversation.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, it's natural to draw comparisons to one's own cultural background. However, successful negotiation requires more than just a superficial understanding of cultural differences. It demands a deeper appreciation for the historical, social, and psychological factors that shape a culture, including its values, biases, and ingrained behaviors. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's essential to respect its unique characteristics and work within its framework, especially when navigating unfamiliar territory.\n\nThe concept of culture is often misunderstood as being strictly tied to national identity. In reality, corporate and organizational cultures can exhibit distinct characteristics that differ from the broader societal culture. For instance, a company may prioritize a fast-paced work environment or emphasize employee well-being, leading to differences in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within a single company, regional and departmental differences can create diverse perspectives and approaches to negotiation.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's underlying values is crucial, as they provide the foundation for its behavior and decision-making. For example, in cultures where saving face is paramount, a negotiator will likely avoid public displays of conflict or compromise. Conversely, cultures that prioritize a tough bargain may be more willing to engage in aggressive negotiation tactics. By considering these cultural nuances, a negotiator can tailor their approach to the specific context and build a stronger rapport with their counterpart.\n\nEstablishing a personal connection with the opposing party can also be a key factor in successful negotiation. By learning about their interests, motivations, and concerns, a negotiator can create a more empathetic and effective dialogue, leading to more constructive outcomes.",
            "The idea that a person can live their life with the conviction that there is no divine presence was first articulated in the Bible, specifically in Psalm 14, where it is attributed to the writings of the early Christian philosopher, St. Anselm. This sentiment is not unique to Anselm, as it is also echoed by the 13th-century scholar Thomas Aquinas. To compare their arguments effectively, we will assume that both authors are attempting to establish the existence of a higher power, one that is consistent with the biblical narrative. This assumption allows us to evaluate their approaches without straying from the core topic. While both thinkers present compelling arguments, a closer examination reveals that neither provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the nature of the divine.\n\nLet's begin by examining Anselm's perspective. He posits that the existence of a higher power can be discerned through introspection, suggesting that the notion of a divine presence is inherent within the human experience. According to Anselm, our understanding of the divine is not derived from external evidence, but rather from the internal workings of the human mind. This philosophical stance emphasizes the role of introspection in shaping our comprehension of the world, and it is this introspective approach that characterizes Anselm's concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more systematic approach, advocating for the use of reason and empirical evidence to demonstrate the existence of a higher power. This position has significant implications for the spread of religious ideas, as it allows for a more logical and evidence-based approach to conversion. Aquinas presents five distinct lines of reasoning that support the existence of a higher power, each of which relies on the principles of logic and causality. For instance, he argues that the presence of causality and the existence of degrees of excellence both point to the existence of a higher power that underlies the natural world.",
            "The formative period of Buddhism dates back to the early centuries of the Common Era, specifically to the 5th or 6th century BCE. It was during this time that a prince, who would later be revered as the Buddha, embarked on a transformative journey, relinquishing worldly attachments to attain profound enlightenment. This pivotal event gave rise to the Buddhist tradition, with Theravada Buddhism being the most influential strand. Spanning over two and a half millennia, the religion has undergone significant evolution, yielding distinct expressions. A testament to this change can be observed in Theravada-majority Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, reflecting the dynamic adaptation of Buddhist practices. This ceremony, participated in by both clergy and lay adherents, holds spiritual significance, despite not being explicitly outlined by the Buddha. This divergence from the original teachings underscores the fluid nature of Buddhist doctrine, encompassing both superficial customs and its core tenets.\n\nThroughout this analysis, several key terms will be employed. The internal versus external dichotomy will be particularly relevant. Here, an internal force refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status. Conversely, external forces originate from non-Buddhist sources. A hostile force is any influence that imperils or seeks to harm the Buddhist community, often rooted in a negative perception of the religion. In contrast, a benign force is one that neither aims to harm nor assist the community, although its outcomes may be either beneficial or detrimental byproducts.\n\nTo comprehend Theravada Buddhism, it is essential to delve into its foundational principles. The religion's core tenets revolve around the concept of the triple gem – the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. The Dharma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts classified into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, Vinaya Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka comprises the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the code of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including the concepts of Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these notions is crucial for breaking free from the cycle of rebirth, known as Sansara. Accomplishing this would mean transcending the three fundamental afflictions – lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes a set of guidelines for laypeople and monks alike, with laymen adhering to the five precepts (non-harming, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and abstention from intoxicants) and monks following a more extensive code of conduct. The four noble truths represent the fundamental doctrine of Buddhism, comprising the recognition of Dukkha, the acknowledgment that attachment leads to suffering, and the understanding that suffering can be overcome.",
            "A notable 57-year period of tension existed between the United States and Mexico, spanning from 1836 to 1893, according to historical accounts (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the United States successfully secured control over Texas and the American Southwest. This marked the culmination of numerous clashes between the two nations, which subsided on the eve of World War I. The rivalry's origins can be attributed to divergent views on matters such as faith, cultural identity, and historical tradition, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis phenomenon is not unique to the United States and Mexico; bordering nations frequently experience conflicts of interest that contribute to the development of adversarial relationships. The dynamics at play in this instance are reminiscent of other enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. As historian David M. Pletcher (1977) observed, the United States' long-standing diplomatic challenges with Mexico and Cuba are notable exceptions within the broader context of U.S.-Latin American relations (p. 41). The geographical proximity of these nations to the United States likely contributed to their historical rivalry, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed relatively cordial relations with the United States.\n\nA significant factor in the tension between the United States and Mexico was their differing stances on religion, a theme that has influenced the dynamics of numerous international conflicts throughout history. Historian Sally Frahm (2001) noted that, whereas Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they had previously opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries (p. 86). This ideological divide mirrored the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, albeit with a distinct focus on religious differences. The distrust between the English and Spanish empires had a lasting impact on the relationship between the United States and Mexico, as both nations inherited a legacy of animosity from their colonial past.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), a total of 17 disputes characterized the 57-year rivalry between Mexico and the United States. The majority of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into the United States and other border-related problems. The specter of bandits and outlaws from U.S. border towns posed a significant challenge that persisted until both nations exerted military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) attributed the eventual decline of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the United States, which altered the dynamics of their relationship (p. 109). As American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, the rivalry gradually dissipated in the latter part of the 19th century (p. 110).",
            "The life I knew was turned upside down fifteen years ago when a previously unknown condition rendered me severely incapacitated.  At the time, I was working as a nurse, a profession I had chosen in pursuit of stability and security, which I had lacked during my formative years. The repeated reassurances I received that 'there would always be work and people would always need medical care' led me to put aside my aspirations to become a scientist or journalist, opting for a more secure career path.\n\nNow, at 46, I am single, financially strained, and unable to work. Despite living on Social Security Disability for the past fifteen years, I have almost nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a constant assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty has become a defining feature of my life, yet one thing remains clear: I owe my ability to cope to the unwavering support of my loved ones and a few close friends. In times of true crisis, one's strength is often an illusion.\n\nMy point is that life is inherently unpredictable, and no amount of preparation can guarantee immunity to adversity. Despite the importance of being prepared, there are some challenges that can only be overcome with the help of others.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need for self-reliance, I firmly believe that Americans would be better off learning to trust and rely on each other, rather than relying solely on a faltering system. The conservative notion of 'rugged individualism' is an idealized concept that overlooks the role of community and mutual support in the face of adversity. The pioneers who braved the frontier did not succeed in isolation, but through collaboration and shared resources.\n\nWhile it is wise to be prepared, I encourage individuals to supplement their preparations with a deeper connection to their community. Build a disaster kit, learn basic first aid, and stock a cache of non-perishable food items. If possible, consider cultivating a small garden or preserving food for future use. However, do not overlook the value of building genuine relationships with your neighbors, who may become your most vital lifeline in times of need.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, with various constraints and limitations influencing its direction. Although pioneers like D'Arcy Thompson acknowledged the challenges of translating organic forms into mathematical language as early as 1917, the field has yet to fully unlock the secrets of morphological development. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have expanded our understanding of mollusk skeletogenesis, particularly in the context of ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum by integrating mathematical modeling, experimental studies, and X-ray imaging.\n\nWe utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995), allowing us to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change within the clade.\n\nThe shell can be thought of as a three-dimensional structure that evolves over time, with whorls forming a spiral pattern around a central axis. This axis, known as the columella, runs through the shell's central column. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, with each whorl separated by a continuous line, or suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the last. The apex, or tip, of the spire and the base of the shell are the two opposite ends, with the animal emerging through the aperture.\n\nShells can be visualized from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The apical view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is the standard orientation.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, with estimates rounded to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nThe shell's growth can be represented as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal adds new material. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can chart the trajectory of the aperture. This trajectory can be mathematically and graphically represented, allowing us to modify the parameters and simulate alternative skeletogenic pathways.",
            "A crucial analysis of Indonesia's progress toward the Millennium Development Goals reveals a paradoxical situation, where advancements in some areas coexist with stagnation in others. Notably, the country has been able to achieve significant strides in water and sanitation targets, yet the rates of improvement in child and maternal health remain sluggish. A closer examination of the underlying factors behind this disparity is necessary to inform the next course of action.\n\nDespite the commendable increase in births attended by skilled health professionals, such as doctors and nurses, the reliance on traditional practitioners like midwives raises concerns. These midwives often lack the necessary medical expertise to handle complications during childbirth, resulting in a substantial number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Consequently, the reported improvements in this area may be somewhat misleading, underscoring the need for more comprehensive healthcare coverage.\n\nFurthermore, there has been a concerning decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional. In addition, data on postnatal care is sparse, highlighting a pressing issue that warrants attention. The disparity in cesarean-section rates between urban and rural areas is another pressing concern, with rates hovering around 4% nationwide. In urban settings, the c-section rate is significantly higher at 7%, while in rural areas, it is a mere 2%. This stark contrast underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with a clear bias toward urban areas.\n\nAnother concerning aspect is the vertical inequity in service utilization, with a 27% gap in access to healthcare between the poorest and richest quintiles. This disparity is likely due to the high out-of-pocket costs associated with healthcare services, making it increasingly difficult for the poor to access essential medical care. The question now arises: what is the most effective approach to address the glaring gaps in neonatal and maternal care? Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system, prioritizing the well-being of mothers and children before and after pregnancy?\n\nWhile programmatic approaches may seem attractive due to their targeted objectives and rapid results, they also have drawbacks. Investing heavily in a particular area of the health sector can divert resources away from other essential areas, leading to a brain drain and duplication of services. The example of the HIV/AIDS program's impact on the family planning sector is a stark illustration of this phenomenon. Running multiple parallel programs can also result in administrative burdens, duplication of efforts, and inefficiencies in resource allocation.",
            "Charles Dickens' novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the social hierarchy of the time period.  However, his works \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" diverge from this tradition by incorporating elements of enigma and an affinity for the unconventional. These narrative departures enhance the complexity of the characters within each novel, offering a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional landscapes.\n\nThe following passage from Dickens exemplifies the unsettling and dreamlike quality that pervades these narratives: \"A cacophony of disorienting thoughts assaulted his mind as he continued to oscillate between Sikes and Crackit, who were vociferously disagreeing. The words they uttered seemed to reverberate within his ears, and when he finally regained his attention, he found himself conversing with them... Suddenly, the sound of gunfire pierced the air, and a chorus of cries and shouts erupted, accompanied by flashes of light, as he was hastily borne away by an unseen force. Amidst this ephemeral chaos, a vague, gnawing sense of pain persisted, tormenting him incessantly.\"\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests through the use of dream sequences or states of altered consciousness, serving to vary in function and content depending on the specific narrative context. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these events frequently provide insight into Oliver's inner world, revealing the sources of his distress and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28 illustrates Oliver's struggles to cope with his circumstances, as he relives the traumatic event in a dreamlike state while desperately seeking assistance. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of agency in the face of adversity, as well as the dire consequences for his physical well-being, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, rendering his senses numb, and he experiences his despair once more, now linked to a profound sense of fear rather than shock. As Oliver is overwhelmed, the question arises about the responsibility for his misfortune, suggesting that it was not his own doing. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has limited control over his circumstances, even in life-or-death situations, implying a growing sense of defeat and resignation.\n\nThe following passage from \"Wuthering Heights\" captures the atmosphere of desolation and timelessness that pervades the novel: \"The day passed – a fleeting moment – and was gone, lost in the darkness of night. Night seemed to stretch on forever, a seemingly endless expanse of silence, yet it was brief, a mere whisper of time.\"",
            "It's been a couple of years since I worked in an after-school program, where I tutored elementary school students in a variety of subjects. I concentrated on providing support in English and reading, as these were areas where I could make the most impact. One student, Adrian, who I believe was in the third or fourth grade at the time, stood out to me. He was struggling with reading, and I soon realized that there was something unusual about the way he approached the task. Certain letters were familiar to him, while others caused him significant difficulties. Adrian was of Latin American descent, and it was this that initially led me to suspect that language might be a factor in his struggles.\n\nHowever, this assumption was challenged when I met his mother, who spoke only Spanish. Despite our limited communication, it became clear that Adrian's issue wasn't related to language comprehension but rather to his understanding of the English alphabet. This realization sparked an important insight: even students who speak fluent English can still face significant obstacles when it comes to reading. This experience has stuck with me, and I believe it highlights the need for targeted support in schools, particularly in areas like California where language barriers are common.\n\nLanguage barriers in education are a complex issue, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. While the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes can all be effective tools, they should be used in conjunction with one another to create a comprehensive approach. In my view, the key to success lies in combining these different methods to meet the diverse needs of students.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, has shown promise. Studies have demonstrated that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about the financial implications and the potential benefit to only a subset of students, I believe that implementing this system more widely could have far-reaching benefits for all children. While it may not be feasible or practical to require all teachers to be bilingual, I think it's essential to provide bilingual support staff in schools, such as tutors or aids, to help bridge the language gap.",
            "The notion of a transcendent force beyond our mortal comprehension is a concept that permeates human existence from a tender age. It's an idea that is often explored in various contexts, whether through structured faith, introspection, or a blend of both. While some individuals readily conform to the spiritual traditions passed down through their families, others choose to reject them in favor of personal, unencumbered inquiry. This journey of self-discovery often involves navigating multiple value systems before settling on one that resonates with us. Our pursuit of meaning can be likened to seeking a guiding light in the darkness, a beacon that illuminates the path forward.\n\nA poignant moment of introspection occurred during a quiet evening on a rain-soaked porch with my father. He spoke of cardinals, his favorite bird, as the rhythmic beat of the raindrops created a soothing melody. His gaze, a mix of contemplation and reminiscence, seemed to transcend the present moment. His physical appearance had altered significantly over the preceding months, a reflection of the hardships he faced. I felt a mix of emotions – affection, apprehension, and a deep-seated fear of confronting the reality of his mortality. The tension between acknowledging and avoiding the inevitable was palpable.\n\nMy father passed away in December, shortly after my twenty-second birthday. The prolonged suffering, despite treatment, only added to the sense of urgency and desperation. The question of a higher power's benevolence echoed in my mind. I remember a moment of disillusionment, where I questioned the existence of a deity that seemed indifferent to human suffering. The silence was deafening, and I found myself struggling to connect with something I once believed in.\n\nIn an attempt to shield myself from the harsh reality, I chose not to witness his passing. It was a difficult decision, but I believed it was in line with my father's values and my own sense of dignity. The days that followed were a blur as I grappled with the loss. The anticipation of a phone call that never came only added to my sense of isolation.",
            "In a paradoxical sense, the term 'Gothic Novel' can be seen as a contradictory entity, encapsulating the fusion of antiquity and modernity, as posited by Ian Watt's seminal work The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has undergone a rollercoaster of perceptions, oscillating between being dismissed as superficial and lauded for its ability to evoke a sense of the sublime (as Burke astutely observed). Horace Walpole's inaugural 'Gothic Novel', The Castle of Otranto, ingeniously incorporated elements from both 'ancient' and 'modern' literary traditions, thus giving birth to the proto-Gothic genre. By blending 'old' theatrical conventions with the 'new' narrative structures of emerging novels, Walpole pioneered a unique literary style that he termed 'A Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval theatrical practices, architectural styles, and cultural heritage. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term 'gothic' was employed to describe a multitude of people, styles, and periods, often with a connotation of being outdated or unsophisticated in comparison to the rapidly evolving societal and literary landscape. The intriguing amalgamation of the theatrical 'Gothic' and the novel's innovative format, which allowed readers a more intimate glimpse into the psychological realm of characters, contributed to the genre's remarkable longevity and adaptability.\n\nOne of the pivotal elements of the Gothic novel is the notion of Chivalry, which permeates The Castle of Otranto and other works within the genre. The medieval ideal of chivalry, encompassing the development of a noble knight, serves as a recurring motif, both preserved and reinterpreted by Gothic writers, including Walpole. The reverence for the chivalric code, symbolizing bravery, honor, and competence, was especially significant to these authors, who perceived a growing disparity between the ideal and the reality of their own time. By incorporating chivalric ideals and mannerisms, the 'Gothic past' was romantically idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into Romanticism. In The Castle of Otranto, this is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, as described in the text:\n\nThe description of Frederic highlights a plethora of chivalric attributes; he is a prince, beset by a series of tragic events, and is assumed to have fallen to the infidels. The image of the gallant and courteous knight is, however, somewhat exaggerated, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "The seamless orchestration of goods from raw materials to customer delivery is what defines supply chain management. This intricate dance of processes was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a strategic consultant who recognized the importance of streamlining the entire process to meet customer needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management involves six pivotal components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These elements work in harmony to deliver unparalleled customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. It is here that production managers determine the optimal production plan, taking into account market trends and customer demand. Market analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences, allowing managers to make informed decisions about product offerings and quantities. The chosen production location must also be carefully selected, balancing factors such as volume and quality to meet customer expectations.\n\nEffective production planning is crucial, as it sets the tone for the entire supply chain. Scheduling and equipment maintenance are critical aspects of this stage, as any misstep can have far-reaching consequences for the company. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed meticulous processes for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This level of scrutiny ensures that expectations are clear and direction is unambiguous, allowing for a smooth workflow.\n\nSupply, the second essential element, involves strategic planning to optimize facility capabilities and partnerships. Companies may choose to outsource certain processes to external partners, leveraging their strengths to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality products with flexibility while minimizing costs. By carefully evaluating internal divisions and external collaborations, managers can create a robust supply chain that meets customer needs while maintaining a competitive edge.",
            "Amidst the bustle of a Southeast Asian nation, a poignant statement hangs above the head of a lone figure, a cinematic actor renowned for her portrayal of Juno. Ellen Page stands resolute, her cardboard sign emblazoned with a stark message scrawled in bold letters. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been under the iron-fisted grip of a military junta since 1962, its ascent to power marked by a coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests shook the nation, sparked by a decade-long period of relative calm. Led by a fraternity of Burmese monks clad in their distinctive saffron-robed attire, these protests garnered widespread attention and earned the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution.\" As the protests gained momentum, the government's initial concession to allow peaceful gatherings soon gave way to a vicious cycle of violence, with the military launching a brutal crackdown on monasteries and targeting foreign journalists, including the tragic killing of Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai in 2007. Official reports estimated 13 fatalities, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the military, painted a haunting picture of a much higher death toll, with numerous bodies estimated to be in the thousands.\n\nThis phenomenon is not an isolated incident, nor is it a recent development. The urge to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control has been a persistent thread throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were revered as deities, ushering in an era of prosperity – albeit one marked by ritualistic self-sacrifice and technological advancements. In more contemporary times, the United States has seen its fair share of authoritarian tendencies, including the presidency of George W. Bush, whose alleged connections to Ted Haggard, a prominent figure in the Republican Party, have raised eyebrows.\n\nHistorical precedents abound, such as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where a confluence of intellectuals, labor activists, and students came together to challenge the Chinese government's authoritarian regime. The death toll in this instance remains shrouded in uncertainty, with official reports ranging from 200 to 300, while independent estimates suggest a staggering 2,000 to 3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s is another harrowing example, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, disregarding ethnic affiliations. The atrocities perpetrated during Hitler's Third Reich, a period marked by the mass persecution and extermination of Jews, serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "One of the key factors contributing to Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is his remarkable longevity and the resultant mastery of his craft. As a composer, Ellington frequently achieved a harmonious balance between subtle piano work and the individual talents of his orchestra members. By crafting frameworks that allowed for improvisation, Ellington not only showcased each musician's capabilities but also generated a dynamic interplay of sounds that elevated the ensemble as a whole. His orchestral compositions often seamlessly integrated diverse styles, underscoring the versatility and cohesion of his band.\n\nA prime example of Ellington's innovative approach can be found in Creole Love Call, a piece that exemplifies his use of voice as a melodic instrument. This early work showcases his ability to incorporate vocals without the constraints of lyrics, effectively enriching the sonic tapestry. Throughout his career, Ellington demonstrated a distinctive sensitivity to the unique styles of his soloists, as evident in his collaborations with various musicians.\n\nCreole Love Call is a 12-bar blues piece characterized by six distinct sections, each contributing to the rich narrative. Section one features a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, which gradually transitions from a smooth tone to a more rugged quality. The second section presents a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the melody, punctuated by extended blue notes. The third section showcases a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nThe subsequent sections build upon this foundation, with the full band echoing the first chorus through a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections. The fifth section reaches a climactic conclusion, as the reeds take center stage with a call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final section returns to the initial structure, with the voice adopting the distinctive \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant flourish by a trombone. This utilization of voice as a tone color adds a unique dimension to Ellington's work, a trait consistently evident throughout his compositions.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly merges his skill in orchestration with his acute sense of tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing effectively combines the vocal and instrumental aspects of their performances. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further explores this concept, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's trombone to introduce the melody in a captivating manner.",
            "She had long been plagued by an inexplicable void, a gnawing sense of incompleteness that had taken hold around the time she entered adolescence. Three years had passed since that initial feeling had arisen, and yet, it persisted, refusing to be satiated. The nature of this yearning had evolved over time, shifting from a desire for a tangible object to a deep-seated need for human connection. However, her lack of interest in the boys who had shown interest in her had left her questioning her own emotional landscape.\n\nAs a teenager, she often found herself pondering the reasons behind this peculiar phenomenon, trying to unravel the tangled threads of her emotions. The years of introspection had yielded various theories, but none had provided a satisfactory explanation for her emotional state. As a result, she continued to navigate life with a sense of disquiet, her mind repeatedly returning to this enigmatic void.\n\nHer upbringing had been marked by a sense of tranquility, thanks to her parents' calm and harmonious relationship. Arguments were rare in her household, and when they did occur, they were usually centered around her desire for independence and self-expression. Her parents' peaceful nature had been a stark contrast to her own effervescent personality, which had earned her a reputation as a lively and endearing individual.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was jolted by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice was a stark contrast to the sound of distress that had pierced the air. She rushed into the kitchen, her heart racing with concern, and found her mother lying on the ground, writhing in pain. The daughter sprang into action, placing a supportive hand on her mother's shoulder as she exclaimed, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" Her mother's response was laced with urgency, \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to get me to the hospital.\" The daughter's eyes widened with worry as she quickly assessed the situation and sprang into action.\n\nWith her mother directing her, she carefully lifted her into a seated position and guided her to the car, where she carefully settled her into the backseat. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her mind consumed by the need to ensure her mother's well-being. Upon arrival, the antiseptic scent and cacophony of sounds created a disorienting atmosphere, but her daughter's primary concern remained her mother's health. She quickly called for the medical staff, who swiftly responded with a sense of urgency, and her mother was attended to.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had suffered a fall from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study focused on the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed), a modified version of the Mediterranean Diet, which emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and lower consumption of saturated fats and animal products. Moderate alcohol intake is also permitted.\n\nPrevious research has shown that adherence to the Mediterranean Diet is associated with a reduced risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. However, prior studies have not specifically examined the relationship between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke mortality. An earlier intervention trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean Diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles in obese individuals.\n\nThe present study involved 74,886 women aged 38-63 years, free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The women completed six food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) from 1984 to 2004, which assessed their dietary habits over the preceding year. The response rate was over 95% across the 20-year study period. FFQs were validated through external reviews of medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Cases of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through these records, with approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions classified as probable based on available information.\n\nAdditional variables, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy, were calculated for each FFQ. Leisure-time physical activity was also assessed, starting in 1986. To account for individual variability and long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the aMed score were calculated from the repeated FFQs.\n\nThe analysis controlled for potential confounders, such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to investigate the association between the aMed score and risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal events.\n\nThe results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the US economy hit a severe downturn, marked by a sharp increase in unemployment and a catastrophic collapse of the housing market. A significant number of major corporations suffered devastating losses, raising pressing questions about the causes and potential prevention of such a crisis. In essence, the financial debacle can be attributed to ill-conceived and short-sighted policy decisions that prompted banks and financial institutions to extend high-risk loans to consumers during a time of economic instability. Concurrently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac found themselves under intense pressure to invest in and repackage subprime mortgages as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the resulting financial strain was transferred to the repackaged securities, ultimately destabilizing the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration's efforts to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, the President relaxed lending regulations, potentially sowing the seeds of the subprime crisis that would materialize seven years later. A New York Times article from 1999 highlighted the issue, stating that Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, was facing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand its mortgage lending to low-income households while maintaining profitability. A prescient journalist, Steven Holmes, noted that this approach could lead to a government bailout similar to the one in the 1980s, predicting the severe economic consequences of such actions.\n\nA complex interplay of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the widespread adoption of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs. This web of financial instruments not only entwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market but also led to excessive leverage among US households and financial institutions. As a result, the economy became highly susceptible to even minor fluctuations in housing prices.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. In 2007, the top US investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. This led to the collapse of several major financial institutions, including Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt, prompting the government to take control in September 2008.",
            "The Art of Exposition: A Cautionary Tale\n\nFor writers, there exists a precarious balance between revealing the intricacies of a narrative and overwhelming the reader with unnecessary information. Dr. Emma Taylor dubs this crux the \"exposition conundrum.\" While attempting to guide readers through the labyrinth of backstory and details, writers often find themselves lost in a sea of exposition, only to have their audience grow disengaged.\n\nThe fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell\" is well-known, yet even seasoned writers like Dr. Taylor struggle to avoid lengthy passages that fail to advance the plot. Exposition, in essence, is the inclination to disclose significant information in a straightforward manner. This can manifest in the form of a character divulging an abrupt history lesson or the author itself taking the reins to convey crucial details.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, consider a narrative where a protagonist's husband is suddenly and tragically murdered. Rather than a meager two lines of dialogue, a more immersive experience would delve into the nuances of their relationship, allowing readers to empathize with the heroine's emotional response. A compelling character study of the husband, captured through his interactions, mannerisms, and dialogue, would not only enrich the narrative but also facilitate a deeper connection with the heroine. The audience would become invested in their fate, and, consequently, the story would gain depth.\n\nEffective exposition, therefore, requires a delicate balance between providing the essential framework of the narrative and crafting a rich tapestry of characters and their relationships. Writers must avoid the temptation to gloss over pivotal details, instead choosing to incorporate subtle hints and nuanced character development. This approach will not only captivate the reader but also prevent the narrative from devolving into a dry recitation of facts.\n\nAs a writer, one must resist the urge to rush through exposition, opting instead for a more considered approach. Take, for instance, the introduction of a new character. Rather than listing their extensive history, including their military background and personal aspirations, a more engaging method would be to gradually reveal these details through their actions, dialogue, and interactions. By doing so, the reader will become invested in the character's growth and development, much like the protagonist's journey.",
            "On August 13, 2011, I viewed two broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio. The first breaking news segment, which aired live that morning, centered on a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio. A local man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was taken into custody after allegedly stabbing his wife. Although the wife's name was not disclosed, her mug shot was briefly shown, and Hostettler's appearance was described in a straightforward manner. Given the story's developing nature, the two-minute coverage seemed proportionate.\n\nThe second story focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which resulted in the critical injury of an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers. The police investigation was ongoing, with no suspects identified at the time. The limited coverage of this story might have been due to various factors, including the circumstances surrounding the incident and the location. It's worth noting that crime stories involving individuals from diverse backgrounds often receive varying levels of attention in the media. This phenomenon is a pattern that I have observed over the years, where high-profile cases involving individuals from the majority demographic tend to receive more extensive coverage compared to those from minority groups.\n\nThe next segment reported on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Authorities provided details about the suspected incident location and the type of firearm used, which was a .22 caliber rifle. A $5,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe following story concerned weather forecasts for the upcoming weekend, with temperatures expected to range from the mid-to-low 80s. The brief coverage was likely intended to pique viewer interest and encourage continued viewing.\n\nAdditionally, a story about a robbery at a convenience store on Clime Road in Columbus was presented. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hooded sweatshirt, was still at large. It's worth noting that the emphasis on the perpetrator's appearance and skin tone seemed unusual.\n\nLastly, a segment highlighted the conviction of Rene Rodriguez, a prominent figure in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation that spanned from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence in years, the report mentioned 300 months. The inclusion of Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage seemed unnecessary, as it did not directly relate to the details of the case.",
            "The intricate, multifaceted relationship between brothers is a profound and often paradoxical bond. This connection is comprised of a complex array of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and a range of other conflicting sentiments. Brothers possess a unique understanding of one another, one that surpasses the comprehension of outsiders. This deep-seated connection allows them to see themselves reflected in their brother, fostering an unshakeable sense of self-awareness. The intensity of this bond is most evident in moments of desperation, when the true nature of their relationship is put to the test. The associated emotions can be both uplifting and devastating, carrying significant consequences that serve as a catalyst for growth and self-discovery.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the complex dynamics between two brothers, as they navigate a treacherous landscape of emotions. Their futile journey is marked by a poignant clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, ultimately resulting in a tragic confrontation. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's omniscient perspective, the novel masterfully conveys the intricate emotions and perspectives that shape the protagonist's actions.\n\nA pervasive undercurrent of pride drives the protagonist's decisions, from his initial desire for a capable sibling to his ultimate actions. His vision of a brother who could share in his adventures and experiences is shattered by the reality of his brother's physical limitations. The protagonist's frustration and disappointment are palpable, as he grapples with the harsh realities of his brother's condition. However, a glimmer of hope emerges when he recalls the child's smile, highlighting the depth of his emotional connection to his sibling. This nuanced portrayal reveals a complex emotional landscape, marked by both altruistic and self-serving motivations.",
            "The human brain functions as a complex information-processing system, capable of intricate cognitive operations. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to sophisticated, so too have the analogies used to describe its workings. Initially, it was likened to a writing surface, then to a papyrus scroll, followed by a codex, and most recently, to a computer. While these analogies offer a foundation for understanding, it's essential to recognize their limitations, as they can lead to oversimplifications and misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing commences with the sensory organs, which transmute physical stimuli into electrical signals. Sensory input, comprising touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, is repeatedly reworked by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black rectangle against a white backdrop, bottom-up processing aggregates fundamental information such as color, spatial orientation, and object boundaries to deduce that the shape is a box. Top-down processing, conversely, utilizes the decisions made during the bottom-up process to accelerate object recognition, allowing you to identify the shape as a distinct, self-contained entity – in this case, a black box – rather than a void or an indentation.\n\nOnce information has undergone a degree of processing, an attention filter determines its relative importance and allocates it to specific cognitive processes. As you look down at your shoes, for example, your brain processes each individual blade of grass, yet a healthy attention filter inhibits you from consciously perceiving them as distinct entities. In contrast, you might readily identify your name amidst background noise. The information processing pathway involves multiple stages, with attention modulating the results at every juncture.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first store it. There are several types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods suited to various types of sensory stimuli. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on visual appearance, phonetic properties, or semantic meaning. Subsequently, information must be maintained. Research on animal subjects suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained through an electrical signal that cycles through a specific sequence of neurons for a brief duration. The structure of certain proteins is hypothesized to maintain long-term memories.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized within the brain, each derived from various disciplines, including human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are connected based on their affinity and relatedness. For example, in this model, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so forth.",
            "In the dystopian society depicted in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, the convergence of technology and capitalist ideologies raises significant concerns. The novel's inhabitants prioritize communal interests over individual autonomy, with a focus on immediate gratification. From a young age, they are conditioned to pursue happiness without questioning the underlying social structure. This setup reveals the characters as pawns in a larger game, subject to the control of the World Controller, who dictates a single ideology.\n\nUpon analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens, it becomes apparent that Huxley critiques the emerging economic systems of his time. Key terms from Marxist theory, such as homogeny and reification, are embedded throughout the narrative, underscoring the author's apprehensions regarding the capitalist model. The concept of false consciousness is a particularly relevant example, as it illustrates how the masses are kept in the dark about their true economic relationships, preoccupied instead with personal gain.\n\nThe conditioning of the lower-class citizens, facilitated by hypnopædia, serves to reinforce this notion. Their desires are manipulated to prioritize consumption, indulgence, and materialism, effectively suppressing any awareness of the social hierarchy and their place within it. This manipulation is perpetrated by the World Controller, who maintains a grip on power through hegemony – the dominance of a particular group over others.\n\nThe novel's portrayal of social classes highlights the effects of capitalist oppression. The lower classes, exemplified by the Deltas and Gammas, are oblivious to their manipulation, while those in higher positions, including the Alphas and Betas, often acquiesce to their roles. Even characters like Bernard, who seem to be aware of the oppressive nature of the society, ultimately conform to their designated positions.\n\nThe novel's depiction of relationships is also noteworthy. The characters lack depth and individuality, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism erode human agency and emotional expression. Interactions between individuals are superficial, characterized by the objectification of women and a focus on physical appearance. The complacency of the societal classes towards their positions in the hierarchy further underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, as they prioritize conformity over autonomy.\n\nThe novel can be seen as a commentary on the ways in which capitalism can lead to a false sense of security among the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal norms. Huxley's critique of capitalism serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancements and the consequences of a society that values consumption above all else.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, I've grown accustomed to navigating the campus's vast expanse. Getting from one end of the campus to the other can be a significant undertaking, particularly for those residing in outlying dormitories. My own experience as a freshman, housed in East Halls, highlights the challenges of traversing the campus. The considerable distance to classes in the Willard building, situated near the heart of campus, often necessitated a 25-minute walk, sometimes longer if inclement weather prevailed in State College. Engaging in conversation with an alumnus, I learned that the area surrounding East Halls was once characterized by extensive vacant land. This open space has since been transformed into sports facilities, modern buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and nearby apartment complexes. As the university continues to expand, the difficulty of navigating the campus becomes increasingly pronounced. In this context, the bicycle emerges as a promising solution. However, a bike alone is insufficient; it requires regular use and a campus environment that accommodates the needs of cyclists.\n\nIn a conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling, I was struck by his sentiments: \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't trendy to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling offers unparalleled efficiency, allowing one to cover distances of up to 30 miles on a bowl of oatmeal and moderate exercise. As an off-campus resident, I've come to appreciate the benefits of cycling. Specifically, I reside in a location equidistant from the campus center as some on-campus dormitories. The decision to purchase a bike has been one of my most prudent choices this year. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, cycling can significantly reduce travel time to just 5 minutes, provided I pedal at a moderate pace. However, the most direct route to Thomas building, Pollock Road, can be challenging to navigate, regardless of mode of transportation. While walking offers its own set of advantages, I find myself too time-constrained to prioritize walking. Without my bike, walking would be my sole reliable option, requiring an additional 30-40 minutes each day. This translates to over two and a half hours per week, a considerable amount of time I can ill afford to dedicate to commuting. When considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and activities, the total time would be substantial, undermining my academic productivity."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",

To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1).

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Exploring the Complexities of Insomnia Through the Lens of Biological and Sociocultural Perspectives\n\nInsomnia, a widespread sleep disorder, can be understood through the interplay of biological and sociocultural factors. The biological model examines the genetic and physiological aspects of insomnia, while the sociocultural model delves into the environmental influences of demographics, socioeconomic status, and cultural background. This paper reviews existing research to understand how these models intersect and inform our understanding of insomnia.\n\nInsomnia can manifest in various forms, including primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders associated with mental health conditions, and sleep disorders related to medical complications or substance use. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias, with Dyssomnias including insomnia and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy, characterized by cataplexy and automatic REM behavior, is also part of this category. Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve sleep-related behavioral or physiological abnormalities, such as nightmares, sleep terrors, and sleepwalking.\n\nResearch suggests that the biological model of sleep disorders is centered around the role of genetics, heritable factors, and physiological mechanisms. A study utilizing mouse models found that GABAB receptors on orexin neurons in the hypothalamus play a crucial role in regulating sleep and wakefulness. The activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while their inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. The use of GABAB agonists, such as baclofen, has been shown to increase sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). This research has implications for understanding the genetic and environmental basis of sleep disorders in humans and suggests that alterations in the GABAB receptor may contribute to insomnia.\n\nFrom a sociocultural perspective, the findings of this study have significant implications. If the GABAB receptor's phenotype is inherited, it may influence sleep patterns, and alterations to this receptor could disrupt sleep, leading to negative consequences in daily life, such as impaired cognitive function and reduced productivity. This highlights the importance of considering the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in understanding insomnia and developing effective treatments.",
            "Auditory processing disorders can have a profound impact on individuals' daily lives. In this paper, we will delve into the intricacies of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), a condition that affects the brain's ability to process sound information. We will examine the definition of CAPD, its diagnosis, and provide practical advice on how educators can support students with this condition in a mainstreamed classroom setting.\n\nCAPD is a neurological disorder characterized by the brain's impaired ability to interpret and process auditory information. Unlike hearing loss, which affects the ear's ability to detect sound, CAPD is a disorder of the central nervous system. People with CAPD can hear sounds with normal clarity, but their brains have difficulty distinguishing between background noise and meaningful sounds, or differentiating between multiple auditory stimuli.\n\nThe concept of CAPD has been around since the mid-20th century, when researchers first identified it as \"auditory imperception.\" Since then, various tests have been developed to assess and diagnose the condition. For instance, the Italian researchers Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of auditory tests in the 1950s, while the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association notes that the work of Kimura in the 1960s laid the groundwork for understanding the neural basis of auditory processing.\n\nThose affected by CAPD may exhibit a range of symptoms, including difficulty localizing sounds in space, distinguishing between similar sounds, recognizing patterns, and detecting changes in speech tone or pitch. They may also struggle to filter out background noise or prioritize relevant auditory information. Furthermore, their brains may have difficulty processing sequential auditory information, which can lead to confusion and difficulty following conversations.\n\nTo diagnose CAPD, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other professionals use a combination of observational assessments and standardized tests. These evaluations typically involve observing the individual's listening behaviors, as well as their performance on tasks that assess auditory processing skills. While there is no single test that can definitively diagnose CAPD, a comprehensive evaluation can help identify the underlying challenges and develop targeted interventions.\n\nIn the following sections, we will examine the practical implications of CAPD in a mainstreamed classroom setting and provide guidance on how educators can support students with this condition.",
            "The play Twelfth Night presents a complex exploration of deception and its consequences, raising questions about the delicate balance between self-preservation and social relationships. Deception, particularly in the guise of gender role reversal, can be a double-edged sword: while it may initially provide a means of protection, it ultimately risks alienating the individual from their support network and forcing them to confront the consequences of their actions.\n\nViola's situation serves as a prime example of this dilemma. Disguising herself as a man allows her to navigate a foreign land safely, but it also creates a disconnect with the women around her and leads to complications with her own emotional desires. Her portrayal as Cesario sparks confusion, not only for Olivia but also within herself, as she grapples with suppressed romantic feelings for Orsino. The dynamics between these characters highlight the tension between authenticity and deception, making it difficult to discern what is genuine and what is a performance.\n\nIn examining the theme of deception, Twelfth Night also touches on the idea that it can be a catalyst for the revelation of suppressed emotions. The relationships between Olivia, Cesario/Viola, and Orsino are characterized by a web of unexpressed desires and conflicting feelings, which are brought to the surface through the complex web of deceptions. While Olivia's swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian may suggest that her initial attachment was superficial, it also raises questions about the nature of her desires and the extent to which they are influenced by societal norms.\n\nShakespeare's portrayal of Olivia, in particular, can be seen as a commentary on the superficiality of appearances and the tendency to judge others based on surface level characteristics. Her character's ease in switching between romantic interests and familial relationships serves as a commentary on the fluidity of human emotions and the impact of societal expectations on our understanding of ourselves and others.\n\nUltimately, Twelfth Night presents a nuanced exploration of the consequences of deception and the complexities of human relationships, leaving the audience to ponder the trade-offs between authenticity and self-preservation.",
            "The legacy of German colonial rule in various regions has been characterized by notable brutality, exemplified by the tragic events of the Ovaherero and Nama genocides in German South West Africa. A more nuanced understanding, however, is necessary to fully grasp the complexities of this colonial empire, which exhibited a multiplicity of policies and governing styles across its vast territories. Educational systems, for instance, demonstrated a considerable degree of diversity, with marked differences in approach and emphasis from one colony to another.\n\nUpon assuming control of German East Africa (present-day Tanzania) in 1919, British authorities found a substantial population of educated and literate Africans. This was in stark contrast to the situation in German Kamerun and other colonies, where German efforts to establish a robust educational framework were widely acknowledged by contemporary observers. The dichotomy between German East Africa and South West Africa (present-day Namibia) is particularly striking. In the former, government-sponsored institutions played a significant role in the education of local populations, whereas in the latter, missionary organizations bore the primary responsibility for educating natives, with government support being relatively limited.\n\nGovernment investment in European education in South West Africa was substantial, with a network of state schools and a more detailed system of regulation and support for missionary institutions. The long-term consequences of these educational policies persisted long after the end of German rule. Unlike other German colonies, which boasted a considerable proportion of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, with an overwhelming majority of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate. This discrepancy is attributed to a multifaceted array of social, economic, and political factors. This paper aims to augment existing research by examining the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards native Africans and exploring the implications of their perspectives.\n\nThe literature on education in the German colonial empire is extensive and diverse, with a significant proportion of sources written in German during the early 20th century. These early works primarily focused on describing the educational systems of individual colonies. Later studies, often written in English, expanded the scope of the discussion through comparative analyses of education in various German colonies and more in-depth investigations of specific aspects of education. Notable among these studies is Cohen's comparative examination of education in South West Africa and East Africa, which highlights the factors contributing to the differences between the two colonies. Cohen suggests that the significant settler population in South West Africa played a pivotal role in shaping the colony's educational system.\n\nSouth West Africa's relatively temperate climate, despite its arid desert regions, attracted a substantial European population, with approximately 15,000 settlers residing in the territory by 1913. This was significantly higher than the number of settlers in the colony with the next largest population, East Africa, where only around 5,336 settlers resided. The demographic composition of the region had a profound impact on the development of local educational systems and continues to influence the region's social and economic landscape to this day.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the past century has been a dynamic and multifaceted process, resulting in an astonishing array of genres that defy easy categorization. The proliferation of sub-genres and sub-sub-genres within these categories has further complicated the landscape, with many styles, such as rock, country, jazz, and folk, branching out into distinct and innovative offshoots. Among these, heavy metal has emerged as a particularly expressive and diverse genre, marked by a predilection for the darker aspects of the emotional spectrum.\n\nHeavy metal's versatility has allowed it to incorporate a wide range of themes and influences, giving rise to a dizzying array of niches and sub-niches that have evolved over the past four decades. This proliferation has led to a situation where it is increasingly difficult to define the genre, which has incorporated elements from various styles while retaining its core identity. To fully grasp the metal music that permeates contemporary music scenes, it is essential to understand the underlying ethos and historical context of the heavy metal movement.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is characterized by a distinctive aesthetic of excess – more intensity, more volume, more theatricality, and more complexity. Skilled musicianship is a hallmark of the genre, with many metal bands showcasing their technical prowess through intricate instrumentation. Additionally, the genre has been shaped by its association with substance use, particularly in the 1970s, when psychedelic experimentation led to the creation of innovative and otherworldly sounds. The incorporation of dark, visceral qualities, reminiscent of the Romantic Era, has also contributed to the genre's distinctive character.\n\nThe influence of these elements can be seen in the work of pioneering bands, such as the Beatles, who pushed the boundaries of heavy music with songs like \"Helter Skelter.\" This influential track, often cited as one of the first heavy metal songs, was a response to the Rolling Stones' darker sound and a demonstration of the Beatles' ability to tackle more intense themes. The song's incorporation into the Beatles' landmark album, The White Album, marked a significant moment in the development of heavy metal.",
            "Henri Rousseau's artistic journey, spanning several decades prior to the emergence of the Surrealist movement, was marked by a unique blend of literal and figurative dreamscapes. His painting, 'The Dream,' created in 1910, serves as a poignant representation not only of a woman enthralled by the wonders of a dream world but also of Rousseau's own aspirations as an artist. Throughout his career, he grappled with a profound internal conflict: the desire for recognition and acceptance by the art world, which he deeply admired, versus the need to remain true to his artistic vision and creative independence.\n\nTo fully appreciate the significance of 'The Dream,' it is essential to understand the circumstances that shaped Rousseau's life and artistic trajectory. Born on May 21, 1844, in Laval, a town in northwest France, Rousseau was the son of a tinsmith and hardware dealer who enjoyed a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. Despite his father's social standing, Rousseau's early life was marked by a lack of formal artistic training. Instead, he worked as a municipal toll service employee, known as a gabelou, for nearly four decades, earning the informal title of douanier, customs inspector. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left Rousseau with a single child, Julia, and a profound sense of sorrow. He found solace in painting, which became a source of comfort and a means to start anew.\n\nIn contrast to his contemporaries, who often romanticized and sentimentalized the peasant class, Rousseau's work reflects the hopes and dreams of the common man. His struggle to gain recognition in the art world, particularly during a time when many talented and well-established artists, including Matisse, were active, is understandable given his late start and limited formal training. As Jan Gordon notes in Modern French Painters, Rousseau's motivation to create conventional art was driven by a desire to be accepted into the prestigious Artiste Français, whereas Matisse sought to avoid clichéd representations in his work. Rousseau's dual aspirations – to be acknowledged by the art world while staying true to his artistic voice – are poignantly captured in 'The Dream,' a painting that continues to captivate audiences with its poignant blend of artistic expression and personal longing.",
            "The interplay between ethics and aesthetics has long been a subject of contemplation among thinkers. It's a notion that resonates deeply, one that has been echoed by visionaries such as John Keats, who so elegantly phrased it in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The truth is that much of our understanding is shaped by education and experience, yet we intuitively grasp the essence of beauty and morality without explicit instruction. Both ethics and aesthetics aim to describe, rather than dictate, and our exploration of morality and beauty is an attempt to unravel the enigma of what makes a piece of art or literature beautiful, or an action morally sound, rather than establishing a set of rules for evaluation or creation. \n\nWhat's more, criticism of art or morals often falls short of capturing the true essence of goodness or beauty. A discussion about, for example, the value of da Vinci's Mona Lisa might delve into concepts like composition, contrast, or cultural context, but these aspects merely scratch the surface. When asked about a favorite work of art or literature, people often respond with a phrase like, \"There's just something about it,\" followed by a more in-depth analysis. I believe that both art and morality defy reduction to a comprehensive description of their qualities. As the astute author Flannery O'Connor astutely observed, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way... you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\" Similarly, ethics possesses this elusive quality, as Ludwig Wittgenstein noted, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\" I propose that this enigmatic aspect is art and morality's most compelling attribute, and that their transcendental nature provides a common ground between them.\n\nIt's striking that we experience both ethics and aesthetics at a profound, almost ineffable level, which the philosopher Immanuel Kant would call noumenal. They touch us on a plane that can be felt, but not fully articulated. This connection is especially evident in literature, where the moral dimension is integral to its essence. As philosopher Ian McKean insightfully pointed out, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are less relevant to other arts, such as music, but they seem to be as pertinent to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Germany's modern landscape is a testament to its robust identity, forged from a rich tapestry of regional influences that stretch from the Alpine foothills to the Baltic coast. This diversity is palpable in the unique cultural nuances of cities like München, Köln, and Dresden, each with its own distinct character. The country's history is a complex tapestry woven from the threads of multiple ancestral groups, their origins shrouded in mystery and subject to ongoing scholarly debate.\n\nThe term \"Germania\" evokes the ancestral homeland of the German people, but its etymology remains a topic of heated discussion among historians and linguists. Some attribute the name to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe, while others point to the word \"germanus,\" first employed by Julius Caesar in his commentary on the Gallic Wars. Caesar, in his observations on the Gallic Wars, noted the Germanic tribes that frequently crossed the Rhine, and used the term to distinguish those he had conquered from those he had not. The Gauls, it is believed, borrowed the word from their own language, using it to describe their neighbors.\n\nCaesar's writings in the first book of his Commentarii de Bello Gallico provide insight into the Germanic tribes: \"Those who reside beyond the Rhine, with whom they are constantly at war...They engage in almost daily battles.\" (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) The etymology of \"Germania\" has been the subject of various theories, including a possible connection to the spear, known as a \"ger,\" or the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout.\" This could suggest that the Germans were known for their loud and boisterous nature.\n\nTacitus, in his seminal work \"De Origine et Situ Germanorum,\" written in AD 98, portrays the Germans as a distinct people, untouched by external influences: \"I would regard them as indigenous, unmixed with other races through immigration or intermarriage. For those who sought to emigrate would arrive by sea, not by land...Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy, for Germany, with its harsh climate, its unforgiving skies, its severe demeanor, unless it were their ancestral homeland?\" (Tacitus, 98) The Romans, while extending their dominion over Germania, seemed reluctant to settle within its borders, preferring to maintain their influence through military campaigns and trade. As the Germanic tribes emerged in the first century, they lived on the periphery of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and skills with the Romans, who valued their military prowess as soldiers in the Roman army.

            "As I stood there, my gaze drifted down, my mind hovering in a state of mental stillness. The scene before me was a kaleidoscope of stimuli, yet my consciousness processed it with an almost detached objectivity. My thoughts darted in and out of my awareness with the speed of a whispered secret, leaving no lasting impression. It was as if my mental state was a fluid, ever-changing entity, unencumbered by the weight of personal interpretation.\n\nMy interest in drawing began at an early age, and I had been drawn to the idea of understanding the underlying mechanisms of perception. This led me to read \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,\" an art instruction book that offered a comprehensive guide to the fundamentals of visual representation. One technique that resonated with me was the idea of framing a subject within a square, simplifying the complexity of the world into a manageable, two-dimensional plane.\n\nAs I stood in front of the bowl, I found myself unable to apply this concept. The overwhelming richness of the scene held me in its grasp, and I was left transfixed, a captive of its beauty. I thought of the great masters – Picasso's blue period, Monet's lush landscapes, and the Renaissance artists' mastery of color. If I were to venture into the realm of artistic expression, this moment might be the start of my journey, a blank canvas waiting for my brushstrokes.\n\nMy hand instinctively reached for the pencil, and with a subtle tension, I began to create. The movement was almost meditative, my mind channeling its will into the physical act of drawing. The water in the bowl seemed to swirl and shimmer, its calm surface reflecting the turmoil brewing within me. But my creative energy was short-lived, as my hand jerked back, my fingers tightening around the pencil handle. The seemingly inert mass of brown matter, stuck to the underside of the toilet, defied my artistic intent. I stood there, my emotions simmering beneath the surface, as I gazed at the unyielding, uncooperative \"art piece.\"\n\nI stood up straight, and with a growing sense of purpose, my hand grasped the toilet paper roll, its cardboard core digging gently into my palm. The sheets rustled softly as I wrapped them around my hand, a makeshift mitt that would protect me from the unyielding mass before me. Slowly, I leaned forward, my hand dipping into the bowl, a deliberate, almost ceremonial gesture, as if I were about to retrieve a sacred relic from the depths of the earth.",
            "Youthful drivers are consistently prone to high-risk behavior behind the wheel.  This problem stems from a multifaceted set of factors. Research has shown that the adolescent brain is not sufficiently developed to fully grasp the complexities of driving, a notion supported by the National Institutes of Health. Furthermore, a lack of driving experience is a significant contributor to accidents, as novice drivers are more likely to engage in reckless behavior such as speeding and loss of control, resulting in a higher incidence of rollovers and collisions. \n\nAdditionally, the presence of peers in the vehicle increases the likelihood of accidents. A study conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center revealed a correlation between the age of passengers and the number of traffic accidents.  In an effort to mitigate these risks, California and other states have implemented provisional licenses that restrict driving hours and prohibit minors as passengers. However, these measures are merely temporary solutions to a more fundamental issue.\n\nThe key issue lies in the inherent limitations of young drivers, as evidenced by statistical data. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman's research suggests that young people, particularly those under 19 or 20, are more inclined to engage in risk-taking behavior due to a desire for thrills. To address this, it may be wise to delay the issuance of full driver's licenses until this tendency has diminished. Continuously granting licenses to young teens will only perpetuate a cycle of fatal accidents, and the consequences may be catastrophic, especially as the baby boom generation's offspring will soon be entering the driving population.\n\nLegislative action could involve a nationwide approach. Schools could continue to offer driver education courses to prepare future drivers, but individuals under the age of 18 would be prohibited from operating a vehicle. Provisional permits could still be issued prior to a full license, accompanied by a set number of required practice hours, such as the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult, as seen in California. A uniform national standard would be an effective means of safeguarding young drivers across the country.\n\nThis proposal is not an innovative concept, but a sound approach to addressing the pressing issue of youthful driving fatalities.",
            "Browsing through the vast repository of early Edison films housed at the Library of Congress, I opted to explore a select group of 15 trick films from 1895 to 1901. These films predominantly utilized innovative editing techniques to craft convincing illusions. My research primarily focused on analyzing the aesthetic principles governing the majority of trick films and identifying the unique characteristics that distinguished a few of the later entries. \n\nGenerally, trick films produced during the turn of the century adhered to a distinct set of conventions: they were studio-bound, confined within a rigid proscenium framework, featured static camera positions, and relied on long and medium shots, all of which were bound by the rule of one shot per film. However, a few films from the early 20th century began to experiment with this paradigm by introducing multiple shots.\n\nA notable commonality among trick films was their use of an interior set situated within the confines of a proscenium frame. The camera remained fixed in its position, failing to pan or track subjects or objects within the scene. This composition drew its inspiration from the theater and, more specifically, the conventions of vaudeville and magic acts. One limitation inherent in the use of the stage was the restricted movement of figures within the frame, which typically confined actors to lateral motion, preventing them from advancing or retreating towards the camera. For instance, in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900), the actors enter from the right side and move horizontally, only to disappear from view without the camera following.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also led to an emphasis on long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-ups were notably absent from the Edison catalog of trick films, a nod to the theatrical tradition where audiences would observe the entire performance within a framed stage. In line with conventions of early cinema, actors rarely moved towards the camera, thus precluding the use of close-ups. \n\nMost trick films from the period adhered to the principle of one conceptual shot per film, resulting in a typical length of one minute or less, contingent on the frame rate employed. This restriction also limited the dramatic or narrative potential of trick films, which often focused on short, vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearance, and substitution acts, devoid of a cohesive narrative. However, a closer examination of The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between physical shots and perceived shots. Specifically, a single conceptual shot may comprise multiple joined shots, skillfully crafted to create the illusion of a seamless, magical transition.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was an impassioned advocate of Republicanism, whose career as an agriculturalist and brief foray into politics forged a life defined by unwavering dedication and unflinching outspokenness on the principles of individual liberty and governance. His deep-seated commitment to an agrarian way of life served as the bedrock for his philosophical stance on the role of government, which he sought to maintain and promote as the foundation for a robust society.\n\nTaylor saw the United States as a unique opportunity to establish an exemplary system of government, unencumbered by the legacy of a native tradition. This enabled the country's founders to craft a system of self-governance that would prioritize the intrinsic rights of citizens, which he believed were interconnected and mutually dependent. The denial of one right would undermine the integrity of the entire set of rights, diminishing their value. Consequently, he contended that these fundamental rights should remain beyond the reach of government overreach.\n\nIn his vision for an ideal society, Taylor posited that a government must balance the inherent duality of human nature, recognizing both the capacity for good and evil. He subscribed to a strict dualism, arguing that \"as government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human.\" Taylor's conception of good governance emphasized the protection of private property, agricultural advancement, and the discouragement of unchecked capitalism. He believed that a government founded on these principles would operate equitably, even with administration by individuals driven by self-interest – a trait he deemed universal among humans, but only problematic when it led to the exploitation of others. A judicious government was necessary to harness human nature's darker aspects, while vigilantly monitoring the introduction of corrosive influences.\n\nTaylor, like many fellow Republicans of his era, advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, championing an extremely limited federal government with powers strictly defined by the document's explicit text. He recognized that a large federal government would be prone to despotism due to its expense. However, he cautioned that a literalist approach could be perilous, as it might ignore the intent of the Constitution's authors, leading to distortions and corruption. Furthermore, Taylor regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundational document of the United States, as it explicitly articulated the nation's character as a collective of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "Upon reviewing the data presented in Figure 17, it is noteworthy that a significant decline in commuter log submissions occurred during the third month of the project. Several factors could have contributed to this decrease. For instance, the onset of winter at a New England campus often leads to a reduction in alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles and walking, as the weather becomes increasingly inclement. Additionally, the end of the fall semester in December is a time when students and faculty are preoccupied with completing coursework, receiving grades, and winding down for the holiday season. Consequently, the commuter log may have fallen by the wayside for many individuals. Furthermore, the university's holiday break and subsequent closure of campus for an extended period may have also impacted participation.\n\nNotably, the commencement of the spring semester in late January did not rectify the issue, suggesting that factors beyond seasonal fluctuations may be at play. It is possible that the project's initial enthusiasm and participation waned over time, a phenomenon not unique to this initiative. In an effort to counter this trend, we introduced the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a targeted campaign designed to reignite interest and stimulate increased log submissions, which ultimately succeeded in achieving this goal.\n\nOne of the primary challenges encountered was maintaining momentum in the face of predictable dips in engagement, particularly during semester breaks and the holiday season. Another hurdle is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for driving and the freedom it affords. To address this, we implemented an incentive system, offering prizes in the form of gift certificates to local businesses, including restaurants, coffee shops, and retailers. While the rewards were well-received initially, it is intriguing to consider whether more substantial prizes, such as bicycles or alternative fuel vehicles, might have had a greater impact on participation. Exploring this variable could have provided valuable insights into the project's dynamics and potentially mitigated the observed decline in engagement. A key takeaway is that offering escalating rewards over time may have helped sustain interest and participation throughout the project.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer an alternative to traditional index funds and individual stock investments, providing diversification and flexible trading options. One of the key benefits of ETFs is their ability to track a specific index, commodity, or basket of assets, while also allowing for short selling, margin buying, and low minimum share requirements. Notably, ETFs have lower expense ratios compared to the average mutual fund, making them an attractive option for investors. However, it's essential to consider the associated trading commissions, which can be a drawback. The ETF market offers a wide range of investment portfolios, and investors should carefully evaluate the benefits and potential drawbacks of each.\n\nIn this analysis, we will focus on the ETF IHF, examining its top 10 holdings, which comprise 63.58% of the fund's assets. By analyzing these holdings, we aim to determine whether the benefits of owning a single ETF are comparable to the benefits of a diversified portfolio of the same stocks. Additionally, we will investigate whether alternative configurations of these stocks could provide a more optimal risk-adjusted return.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we will concentrate on the top 10 holdings, rather than the entire ETF portfolio. The holdings and their corresponding percentage of total assets are presented below. We will then use this information to estimate the potential performance of a portfolio consisting of these 10 stocks, in the same proportions as the ETF.\n\nThe results of our analysis indicate that a portfolio comprising the top 10 holdings could potentially offer a higher return (6.11%) and lower beta (-0.12) compared to the ETF IHF. However, it is essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this question, we calculated the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing the values to facilitate comparison with the ETF's standard deviation. This analysis will help us determine whether the differences in performance between the two portfolios are statistically meaningful.",
            "One of Edgar Allan Poe's poems often regarded as a standout work is \"Dream-Land.\" A notable aspect of this poem lies in Poe's use of the term \"Thulé,\" which appears in lines 6 and 56. According to Thomas O. Mabbott, this term is linked back to the Roman poet Virgil, who employed it to describe an island situated north of Britain, considered the edge of the known world by the ancient Greeks.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the term \"Thulé\" may also be associated with a more contemporary source, given Poe's evident affinity for German literature. In fact, Poe's interest in the works of German authors, including notable writers such as Goethe, is well-documented.\n\nA quote from Karl J. Arndt's book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon\" highlights the similarity between Poe's \"Dream-Land\" and Goethe's literary style, suggesting a possible influence. Specifically, Arndt observes a striking resemblance between Poe's poem and Goethe's \"Faust,\" a celebrated poetic drama published in two parts, with the first installment appearing in 1808 and the second in 1832, the year of Goethe's passing.\n\nWithin \"Faust,\" a smaller poem titled \"The King of Thulé\" is embedded in the second part. This poem tells the story of a king whose wife passes away, gifting him a goblet before her death. Consumed by grief, the king becomes a recluse, resorting to excessive drinking and ultimately decides to take his own life, bequeathing his possessions to his children and discarding the goblet into the ocean. A similar air of desolation and despair pervades Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" which echoes the temperament and magnanimity of the King of Thulé.\n\nInterestingly, a stage adaptation of \"Faust\" was composed by H.P. Gratton in 1842, mere months before Poe's own use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Poe references Thule not once, but twice in his collected works, employing \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and book-ending \"Dream-Land\" with it. This could be seen as a nod to Goethe's \"Faust\" and its companion piece, \"The King of Thulé.\"\n\nUpon closer examination, it becomes clear that \"Dream-Land\" and \"The King of Thulé\" share striking similarities. Both poems explore the themes of isolation, loss, and a world devoid of vibrancy, evoking a sense of melancholy that permeates both works. Furthermore, Goethe's influence on Poe cannot be understated, given the latter's admiration for Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who was well-acquainted with Goethe's work. Poe's familiarity with Goethe's writing is also evident in the numerous reproductions and adaptations of his works that were prevalent during Poe's time.",
            "In the event of an individual suffering harm after slipping and falling on a spill in a grocery store, they may be eligible to receive punitive damages if the store manager demonstrated a reckless disregard for the consequences of their inaction. This could potentially be the case if the manager was informed of the spill and chose not to address it due to personal obligations, specifically eating dinner, while being aware of previous incidents involving similar accidents.\n\nA court is unlikely to dismiss a claim for punitive damages without further consideration. To justify an award of punitive damages, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant's actions were taken with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm they could cause and were considered despicable. In this instance, Jennifer Palmer may argue that Martin, the store manager, should have anticipated the consequences of not cleaning the spill, given the multiple previous incidents of slips and falls in the store. Furthermore, despite this knowledge, he failed to take action to rectify the situation.\n\nPalmer's argument that Martin's actions can be characterized as despicable is not entirely convincing, but it is still a plausible argument. This is particularly evident given the six slip-and-fall incidents that occurred in 2009 and the failure of the manager to take adequate measures to ensure the store's safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne, a D&D Markets employee, notified his manager, Paul Martin, of an applesauce spill in an aisle. However, Martin declined to address the issue, stating that he was on a dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, also informed Martin of the spill, to which he responded similarly. At 5:30 pm, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer, slipped and fell on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer's accident, five separate slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D's in 2009. Palmer is now pursuing compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and the court is considering whether to grant a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of duty that does not arise from a contractual obligation if the defendant acted with \"oppression, fraud, or malice.\" California's Civil Code states that malice is characterized as conduct intended to cause harm or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is despicable and carried out with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. Courts have determined that conduct is malicious when it involves a deliberate disregard for the plaintiff's rights, particularly when the defendant is aware of the potential dangers of their actions and willfully ignores them. This was the case in Taylor v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, where the court ruled that a defendant's actions were malicious due to their conscious disregard for the consequences of their behavior.",
            "It has been nearly four years since I took a course in Islamic studies at a local institution. Our class discussions often centered around the perception of Islam in modern society, with some classmates questioning whether the religion is inherently hostile. This debate seems more pressing now than ever, particularly in light of recent global events. Observing the shift in media narratives on Islam from a predominantly negative to excessively tolerant stance following the 9/11 attacks has been striking. It is intriguing to consider how a presidential candidate with an obvious Muslim connection, such as Barack Obama, could have gained traction in American politics.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad is a thought-provoking subject for me. Contrary to my initial understanding, his life story diverges significantly from the image of a ruthless conqueror who imposed his faith upon others. Instead, the biography portrays Muhammad as a complex, compassionate individual who was often misunderstood and humbled by his experiences. According to the narrative, his message resonated with individuals who were drawn to his wisdom and conviction, rather than through coercion.\n\nNotably, there are parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the purported miracles of Muhammad. For instance, the account of multiplying food to feed a group of people bears a striking resemblance to similar stories in the Christian scriptures. This narrative device, used to emphasize Muhammad's humility and reliance on divine guidance, raises questions about the nature of truth and the role of miracles in both faith traditions. While the intention may have been to humanize Muhammad, it inadvertently downplays the unique significance of Jesus' life and teachings.\n\nAnother aspect of the biography that struck me was the emphasis on testimonials and conversions. The stories, often relayed through secondary sources, seem designed to provide anecdotal evidence of the Prophet's impact. However, this approach creates a sense of detachment and raises concerns about the reliability of these accounts.\n\nWhat unsettles me most about this biography is the effort to portray Muhammad as a paragon of virtue, embodying qualities such as compassion, wisdom, and gentleness. Historical accounts, however, often contradict this image, leaving me to wonder if contemporary Muslims are aware of the complexities and nuances of Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The trajectory of Christian thought in the immediate aftermath of Jesus' life reveals a gradual departure from its foundational principles.  Observing this historical narrative in broad strokes, we notice a progressive divergence from the original teachings of Jesus.  Despite the persistence of traditionalists who cling to established dogma, their influence is unlikely to be decisive in shaping the broader trajectory of Christian thought.  A growing awareness of historical context will undoubtedly gain momentum in the years to come, prompting a renewed interest in discerning the authentic essence of Christianity from the accretions that have accumulated over time.  As this awareness spreads, it will become increasingly evident that a profound shift is underway, one that will ultimately lead to a return to the fundamental principles that Jesus embodied.  This reversal of the trend in Christian history will unfold gradually, with the removal of extraneous doctrines, layer by layer, as if time itself is rewinding.  The end result will be a reclamation of the core teachings of Jesus, stripped of the varnish of later interpretations.  As this process takes hold in the Western world, we can expect to see a more unified and homogeneous Christian practice emerging, with the church serving as a guiding force.  This phenomenon is not unique to Christianity; human history is replete with examples of reversals, such as the transformation of the Roman Empire from a pagan state to a Christian institution, and the progression from African-American slavery to African-American leadership in the United States.  A similar reversal is likely to occur within Christianity, driven by a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' teachings as metaphorical rather than literal.  To grasp the scope of this transformation, we must first examine the antecedents of Christianity.  The Hebrew scriptures, which formed the bedrock of Jewish thought by the time the Romans seized control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., reveal a complex and multifaceted tradition.  The Jewish population was not monolithic, comprising various factions such as the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common folk.",
            "The notion that individuals are inherently self-serving and egocentric is a pervasive theme in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. This notion is exemplified through the actions of the factory owners and managers who prioritize profit over the well-being of their employees and the environment. Their relentless pursuit of expansion and wealth is depicted as callous and devoid of empathy, as exemplified by the stark image of the factory buildings and the pollution they produce. Sinclair's vivid description of the smoke billowing from the chimneys serves as a poignant reminder of the devastating impact of industrialization on the community.\n\nThe exploitation of workers by their employers is another key aspect of the novel. The owners and managers demonstrate a ruthless disregard for their employees' welfare, pushing them to work excessive hours without adequate compensation or support. The lack of regulatory frameworks in place during the era allowed these practices to thrive, forcing workers to endure hazardous conditions and grueling working hours. The narrative implies that the working class was expected to accept these circumstances, with little to no recourse or assistance available to them.\n\nThe notion of workers as slaves is a powerful metaphor used to convey the extent of their exploitation. The formation of unions, intended to provide a voice for workers, often ended up exacerbating their situation, profiting from their struggles. The novel paints a bleak picture of a system that perpetuates immorality and oppression, with the workers' circumstances eerily mirroring those of enslaved individuals under the system of chattel slavery.\n\nIn this context, Sinclair's work serves as a scathing critique of the social and economic systems of his time, highlighting the need for reform and greater accountability. By shedding light on the darker aspects of industrialization, The Jungle encourages readers to confront the harsh realities of exploitation and to advocate for change.",
            "F. Scott Fitzgerald employs various literary techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby to elicit distinct responses from his readers. Among these techniques, the use of juxtaposition and symbolism stands out for its effectiveness. By pairing seemingly incongruous words and imbuing symbols with meaning, Fitzgerald creates a rich tapestry of emotions and associations. The author's utilization of color symbolism is a notable example of this technique. He repeatedly associates specific colors with particular connotations, often leveraging these associations to convey deeper meaning.\n\nIn the novel, Fitzgerald establishes a nuanced relationship between the colors white and gray. Initially, these colors are presented as polar opposites, with white signifying elegance and refinement, while gray connotes a sense of age and faded grandeur. Fitzgerald sets the stage for this dichotomy early on, depicting characters and settings clad in white, such as Nick's \"white flannels\" at Gatsby's party and Tom's \"white shirt\" during his encounter with Myrtle. The exception to this rule is Nick's experience of Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors,\" suggesting a departure from the typically uniform presentation of white.\n\nFitzgerald further reinforces the meanings he has assigned to these colors by applying them to everyday, mundane subjects. For instance, the \"white chasms of lower New York\" and the \"gray names\" on Nick's timetable serve to underscore the uniformity and conformity of these environments. Additionally, Fitzgerald uses these colors to describe people and places that are plain or unremarkable, such as the \"gray child\" in the railroad and the \"gray old man\" who sells dogs.\n\nAfter establishing the meanings of these colors, Fitzgerald begins to use them to convey a sense of lackluster or uniformity, particularly in the context of Daisy Buchanan. Following a period of relative absence from these colors, Daisy is reintroduced wearing a \"white roadster,\" which subtly shifts the reader's perception of her from a fully fleshed-out character to a more diminished, uniform presence. This technique is reinforced by subsequent descriptions of Daisy, such as the \"gray haze of her fur collar\" and her appearance in a \"white\" dress before her encounter with Tom and Gatsby.",
            "In the southernmost part of California, San Diego County boasts a prime agricultural location, characterized by a benign climate with ample sunlight. The region's farmland is home to a diverse range of crops, including leafy greens, broccoli, squash, tomatoes, citrus fruits, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, and various types of peppers. The demand for organic, community-supported agriculture is substantial, with numerous local organizations experiencing lengthy waiting lists for their products. Organic dairy and eggs are also highly sought after, with several local farms offering tours and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching on their premises. This type of operation presents an opportunity for landowners to participate in government programs while enhancing the natural habitat, allowing for tourism and educational initiatives.\n\nWhile organic farming offers several benefits, including increased biodiversity and reduced chemical usage, it also comes with higher operational costs. Organic farming requires more labor-intensive practices, such as hand-weeding and manual fertilization, which can lead to greater losses compared to conventional methods. Additionally, smaller organic farms often struggle to achieve the same level of efficiency as larger commercial operations. Furthermore, certain conservation practices, like planting cover crops and invasive species removal, can also increase labor costs.\n\nThe chosen property, situated adjacent to the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, is a 160-acre parcel of chaparral, non-native grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Located in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan, the area is home to over a hundred plant and animal species, including several endangered and declining species. The land has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans and later settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. This specific parcel was part of an original homestead patent and was likely used for grazing and wood production for many years.\n\nTo create a realistic model for a small farmer in this area, I researched government programs and chose a piece of property from a real estate website. A nearby organic farm serves as an example of what a landowner might aim to achieve, balancing economic viability with wildlife conservation.",
            "Effective negotiation is heavily influenced by the cultural context in which it takes place. Culture is a complex and multifaceted entity, often defined by its nuances and subtleties rather than its explicit characteristics. Statements that attempt to generalize an entire culture can be misleading and oversimplify its intricacies, such as labeling an entire nation as \"stubborn\" or \"accommodating.\" A more productive approach is to focus on the specific cultural attitudes and values that are relevant to the negotiation, as these will have a direct impact on the dynamics of the conversation.\n\nWhen interacting with a foreign culture, it's natural to draw comparisons to one's own cultural background. However, successful negotiation requires more than just a superficial understanding of cultural differences. It demands a deeper appreciation for the historical, social, and psychological factors that shape a culture, including its values, biases, and ingrained behaviors. Rather than trying to change or judge a culture, it's essential to respect its unique characteristics and work within its framework, especially when navigating unfamiliar territory.\n\nThe concept of culture is often misunderstood as being strictly tied to national identity. In reality, corporate and organizational cultures can exhibit distinct characteristics that differ from the broader societal culture. For instance, a company may prioritize a fast-paced work environment or emphasize employee well-being, leading to differences in dress codes, communication styles, and hiring practices. Even within a single company, regional and departmental differences can create diverse perspectives and approaches to negotiation.\n\nUnderstanding a culture's underlying values is crucial, as they provide the foundation for its behavior and decision-making. For example, in cultures where saving face is paramount, a negotiator will likely avoid public displays of conflict or compromise. Conversely, cultures that prioritize a tough bargain may be more willing to engage in aggressive negotiation tactics. By considering these cultural nuances, a negotiator can tailor their approach to the specific context and build a stronger rapport with their counterpart.\n\nEstablishing a personal connection with the opposing party can also be a key factor in successful negotiation. By learning about their interests, motivations, and concerns, a negotiator can create a more empathetic and effective dialogue, leading to more constructive outcomes.",
            "The idea that a person can live their life with the conviction that there is no divine presence was first articulated in the Bible, specifically in Psalm 14, where it is attributed to the writings of the early Christian philosopher, St. Anselm. This sentiment is not unique to Anselm, as it is also echoed by the 13th-century scholar Thomas Aquinas. To compare their arguments effectively, we will assume that both authors are attempting to establish the existence of a higher power, one that is consistent with the biblical narrative. This assumption allows us to evaluate their approaches without straying from the core topic. While both thinkers present compelling arguments, a closer examination reveals that neither provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the nature of the divine.\n\nLet's begin by examining Anselm's perspective. He posits that the existence of a higher power can be discerned through introspection, suggesting that the notion of a divine presence is inherent within the human experience. According to Anselm, our understanding of the divine is not derived from external evidence, but rather from the internal workings of the human mind. This philosophical stance emphasizes the role of introspection in shaping our comprehension of the world, and it is this introspective approach that characterizes Anselm's concept of faith.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas takes a more systematic approach, advocating for the use of reason and empirical evidence to demonstrate the existence of a higher power. This position has significant implications for the spread of religious ideas, as it allows for a more logical and evidence-based approach to conversion. Aquinas presents five distinct lines of reasoning that support the existence of a higher power, each of which relies on the principles of logic and causality. For instance, he argues that the presence of causality and the existence of degrees of excellence both point to the existence of a higher power that underlies the natural world.",
            "The formative period of Buddhism dates back to the early centuries of the Common Era, specifically to the 5th or 6th century BCE. It was during this time that a prince, who would later be revered as the Buddha, embarked on a transformative journey, relinquishing worldly attachments to attain profound enlightenment. This pivotal event gave rise to the Buddhist tradition, with Theravada Buddhism being the most influential strand. Spanning over two and a half millennia, the religion has undergone significant evolution, yielding distinct expressions. A testament to this change can be observed in Theravada-majority Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed, reflecting the dynamic adaptation of Buddhist practices. This ceremony, participated in by both clergy and lay adherents, holds spiritual significance, despite not being explicitly outlined by the Buddha. This divergence from the original teachings underscores the fluid nature of Buddhist doctrine, encompassing both superficial customs and its core tenets.\n\nThroughout this analysis, several key terms will be employed. The internal versus external dichotomy will be particularly relevant. Here, an internal force refers to influences stemming from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status. Conversely, external forces originate from non-Buddhist sources. A hostile force is any influence that imperils or seeks to harm the Buddhist community, often rooted in a negative perception of the religion. In contrast, a benign force is one that neither aims to harm nor assist the community, although its outcomes may be either beneficial or detrimental byproducts.\n\nTo comprehend Theravada Buddhism, it is essential to delve into its foundational principles. The religion's core tenets revolve around the concept of the triple gem – the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. The Dharma encompasses the Tripitaka, a collection of sacred texts classified into three baskets: the Sutta Pitaka, Vinaya Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Sutta Pitaka comprises the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the code of conduct, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka explores the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism, including the concepts of Anatta (the absence of a permanent self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Understanding these notions is crucial for breaking free from the cycle of rebirth, known as Sansara. Accomplishing this would mean transcending the three fundamental afflictions – lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion). The Vinaya Pitaka prescribes a set of guidelines for laypeople and monks alike, with laymen adhering to the five precepts (non-harming, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and abstention from intoxicants) and monks following a more extensive code of conduct. The four noble truths represent the fundamental doctrine of Buddhism, comprising the recognition of Dukkha, the acknowledgment that attachment leads to suffering, and the understanding that suffering can be overcome.",
            "A notable 57-year period of tension existed between the United States and Mexico, spanning from 1836 to 1893, according to historical accounts (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The rivalry reached its peak during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, in which the United States successfully secured control over Texas and the American Southwest. This marked the culmination of numerous clashes between the two nations, which subsided on the eve of World War I. The rivalry's origins can be attributed to divergent views on matters such as faith, cultural identity, and historical tradition, as well as competing material interests (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31).\n\nThis phenomenon is not unique to the United States and Mexico; bordering nations frequently experience conflicts of interest that contribute to the development of adversarial relationships. The dynamics at play in this instance are reminiscent of other enduring rivalries between neighboring countries. As historian David M. Pletcher (1977) observed, the United States' long-standing diplomatic challenges with Mexico and Cuba are notable exceptions within the broader context of U.S.-Latin American relations (p. 41). The geographical proximity of these nations to the United States likely contributed to their historical rivalry, while other Latin American countries have enjoyed relatively cordial relations with the United States.\n\nA significant factor in the tension between the United States and Mexico was their differing stances on religion, a theme that has influenced the dynamics of numerous international conflicts throughout history. Historian Sally Frahm (2001) noted that, whereas Americans opposed fascism and communism in the 20th century, they had previously opposed Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries (p. 86). This ideological divide mirrored the Cold War's rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, albeit with a distinct focus on religious differences. The distrust between the English and Spanish empires had a lasting impact on the relationship between the United States and Mexico, as both nations inherited a legacy of animosity from their colonial past.\n\nAccording to Diehl and Goerts (2000), a total of 17 disputes characterized the 57-year rivalry between Mexico and the United States. The majority of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border raids from Mexican territory into the United States and other border-related problems. The specter of bandits and outlaws from U.S. border towns posed a significant challenge that persisted until both nations exerted military force along their borders (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) attributed the eventual decline of the rivalry to Mexico's growing dependence on the United States, which altered the dynamics of their relationship (p. 109). As American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico, the rivalry gradually dissipated in the latter part of the 19th century (p. 110).",
            "The life I knew was turned upside down fifteen years ago when a previously unknown condition rendered me severely incapacitated.  At the time, I was working as a nurse, a profession I had chosen in pursuit of stability and security, which I had lacked during my formative years. The repeated reassurances I received that 'there would always be work and people would always need medical care' led me to put aside my aspirations to become a scientist or journalist, opting for a more secure career path.\n\nNow, at 46, I am single, financially strained, and unable to work. Despite living on Social Security Disability for the past fifteen years, I have almost nothing to call my own. Each day is a struggle, a constant assault on my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty has become a defining feature of my life, yet one thing remains clear: I owe my ability to cope to the unwavering support of my loved ones and a few close friends. In times of true crisis, one's strength is often an illusion.\n\nMy point is that life is inherently unpredictable, and no amount of preparation can guarantee immunity to adversity. Despite the importance of being prepared, there are some challenges that can only be overcome with the help of others.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need for self-reliance, I firmly believe that Americans would be better off learning to trust and rely on each other, rather than relying solely on a faltering system. The conservative notion of 'rugged individualism' is an idealized concept that overlooks the role of community and mutual support in the face of adversity. The pioneers who braved the frontier did not succeed in isolation, but through collaboration and shared resources.\n\nWhile it is wise to be prepared, I encourage individuals to supplement their preparations with a deeper connection to their community. Build a disaster kit, learn basic first aid, and stock a cache of non-perishable food items. If possible, consider cultivating a small garden or preserving food for future use. However, do not overlook the value of building genuine relationships with your neighbors, who may become your most vital lifeline in times of need.",
            "The trajectory of evolutionary change in organisms remains a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, with various constraints and limitations influencing its direction. Although pioneers like D'Arcy Thompson acknowledged the challenges of translating organic forms into mathematical language as early as 1917, the field has yet to fully unlock the secrets of morphological development. Recent advances in mathematical modeling have expanded our understanding of mollusk skeletogenesis, particularly in the context of ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research aims to elucidate the mechanisms driving evolutionary-developmental change in Prunum by integrating mathematical modeling, experimental studies, and X-ray imaging.\n\nWe utilized X-radiographic images of Prunum species to identify quantitative parameters that could be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the CerioShell software (Stone, 1995), allowing us to simulate various shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of possible morphological change within the clade.\n\nThe shell can be thought of as a three-dimensional structure that evolves over time, with whorls forming a spiral pattern around a central axis. This axis, known as the columella, runs through the shell's central column. The speed at which whorls expand can vary, with each whorl separated by a continuous line, or suture. In most shells, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the last. The apex, or tip, of the spire and the base of the shell are the two opposite ends, with the animal emerging through the aperture.\n\nShells can be visualized from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural views. The apical view, with the aperture facing the viewer and the apex pointing upwards, is the standard orientation.\n\nA method for counting whorls involves observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two parts, and whorls are counted from this line, with estimates rounded to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nThe shell's growth can be represented as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal adds new material. By tracking the center of each whorl's aperture and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can chart the trajectory of the aperture. This trajectory can be mathematically and graphically represented, allowing us to modify the parameters and simulate alternative skeletogenic pathways.",
            "A crucial analysis of Indonesia's progress toward the Millennium Development Goals reveals a paradoxical situation, where advancements in some areas coexist with stagnation in others. Notably, the country has been able to achieve significant strides in water and sanitation targets, yet the rates of improvement in child and maternal health remain sluggish. A closer examination of the underlying factors behind this disparity is necessary to inform the next course of action.\n\nDespite the commendable increase in births attended by skilled health professionals, such as doctors and nurses, the reliance on traditional practitioners like midwives raises concerns. These midwives often lack the necessary medical expertise to handle complications during childbirth, resulting in a substantial number of maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. Consequently, the reported improvements in this area may be somewhat misleading, underscoring the need for more comprehensive healthcare coverage.\n\nFurthermore, there has been a concerning decline in the proportion of diarrheal cases in children under five treated by a health professional. In addition, data on postnatal care is sparse, highlighting a pressing issue that warrants attention. The disparity in cesarean-section rates between urban and rural areas is another pressing concern, with rates hovering around 4% nationwide. In urban settings, the c-section rate is significantly higher at 7%, while in rural areas, it is a mere 2%. This stark contrast underscores the issue of unequal access to healthcare services across the country, with a clear bias toward urban areas.\n\nAnother concerning aspect is the vertical inequity in service utilization, with a 27% gap in access to healthcare between the poorest and richest quintiles. This disparity is likely due to the high out-of-pocket costs associated with healthcare services, making it increasingly difficult for the poor to access essential medical care. The question now arises: what is the most effective approach to address the glaring gaps in neonatal and maternal care? Should Indonesia focus on developing program-specific approaches or strengthen its overall healthcare system, prioritizing the well-being of mothers and children before and after pregnancy?\n\nWhile programmatic approaches may seem attractive due to their targeted objectives and rapid results, they also have drawbacks. Investing heavily in a particular area of the health sector can divert resources away from other essential areas, leading to a brain drain and duplication of services. The example of the HIV/AIDS program's impact on the family planning sector is a stark illustration of this phenomenon. Running multiple parallel programs can also result in administrative burdens, duplication of efforts, and inefficiencies in resource allocation.",
            "Charles Dickens' novels are characterized by their meticulous attention to detail and a focus on the social hierarchy of the time period.  However, his works \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" diverge from this tradition by incorporating elements of enigma and an affinity for the unconventional. These narrative departures enhance the complexity of the characters within each novel, offering a deeper understanding of their motivations and emotional landscapes.\n\nThe following passage from Dickens exemplifies the unsettling and dreamlike quality that pervades these narratives: \"A cacophony of disorienting thoughts assaulted his mind as he continued to oscillate between Sikes and Crackit, who were vociferously disagreeing. The words they uttered seemed to reverberate within his ears, and when he finally regained his attention, he found himself conversing with them... Suddenly, the sound of gunfire pierced the air, and a chorus of cries and shouts erupted, accompanied by flashes of light, as he was hastily borne away by an unseen force. Amidst this ephemeral chaos, a vague, gnawing sense of pain persisted, tormenting him incessantly.\"\n\nIn both novels, this sense of mystery often manifests through the use of dream sequences or states of altered consciousness, serving to vary in function and content depending on the specific narrative context. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these events frequently provide insight into Oliver's inner world, revealing the sources of his distress and his growing awareness of the harsh realities surrounding him. The reenactment of the shooting in chapter 28 illustrates Oliver's struggles to cope with his circumstances, as he relives the traumatic event in a dreamlike state while desperately seeking assistance. This passage highlights Oliver's lack of agency in the face of adversity, as well as the dire consequences for his physical well-being, which is reflected in his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, rendering his senses numb, and he experiences his despair once more, now linked to a profound sense of fear rather than shock. As Oliver is overwhelmed, the question arises about the responsibility for his misfortune, suggesting that it was not his own doing. This event reinforces the notion that Oliver has limited control over his circumstances, even in life-or-death situations, implying a growing sense of defeat and resignation.\n\nThe following passage from \"Wuthering Heights\" captures the atmosphere of desolation and timelessness that pervades the novel: \"The day passed – a fleeting moment – and was gone, lost in the darkness of night. Night seemed to stretch on forever, a seemingly endless expanse of silence, yet it was brief, a mere whisper of time.\"",
            "It's been a couple of years since I worked in an after-school program, where I tutored elementary school students in a variety of subjects. I concentrated on providing support in English and reading, as these were areas where I could make the most impact. One student, Adrian, who I believe was in the third or fourth grade at the time, stood out to me. He was struggling with reading, and I soon realized that there was something unusual about the way he approached the task. Certain letters were familiar to him, while others caused him significant difficulties. Adrian was of Latin American descent, and it was this that initially led me to suspect that language might be a factor in his struggles.\n\nHowever, this assumption was challenged when I met his mother, who spoke only Spanish. Despite our limited communication, it became clear that Adrian's issue wasn't related to language comprehension but rather to his understanding of the English alphabet. This realization sparked an important insight: even students who speak fluent English can still face significant obstacles when it comes to reading. This experience has stuck with me, and I believe it highlights the need for targeted support in schools, particularly in areas like California where language barriers are common.\n\nLanguage barriers in education are a complex issue, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. While the dual language system, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes can all be effective tools, they should be used in conjunction with one another to create a comprehensive approach. In my view, the key to success lies in combining these different methods to meet the diverse needs of students.\n\nThe dual language system, in particular, has shown promise. Studies have demonstrated that students in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically. Despite concerns about the financial implications and the potential benefit to only a subset of students, I believe that implementing this system more widely could have far-reaching benefits for all children. While it may not be feasible or practical to require all teachers to be bilingual, I think it's essential to provide bilingual support staff in schools, such as tutors or aids, to help bridge the language gap.",
            "The notion of a transcendent force beyond our mortal comprehension is a concept that permeates human existence from a tender age. It's an idea that is often explored in various contexts, whether through structured faith, introspection, or a blend of both. While some individuals readily conform to the spiritual traditions passed down through their families, others choose to reject them in favor of personal, unencumbered inquiry. This journey of self-discovery often involves navigating multiple value systems before settling on one that resonates with us. Our pursuit of meaning can be likened to seeking a guiding light in the darkness, a beacon that illuminates the path forward.\n\nA poignant moment of introspection occurred during a quiet evening on a rain-soaked porch with my father. He spoke of cardinals, his favorite bird, as the rhythmic beat of the raindrops created a soothing melody. His gaze, a mix of contemplation and reminiscence, seemed to transcend the present moment. His physical appearance had altered significantly over the preceding months, a reflection of the hardships he faced. I felt a mix of emotions – affection, apprehension, and a deep-seated fear of confronting the reality of his mortality. The tension between acknowledging and avoiding the inevitable was palpable.\n\nMy father passed away in December, shortly after my twenty-second birthday. The prolonged suffering, despite treatment, only added to the sense of urgency and desperation. The question of a higher power's benevolence echoed in my mind. I remember a moment of disillusionment, where I questioned the existence of a deity that seemed indifferent to human suffering. The silence was deafening, and I found myself struggling to connect with something I once believed in.\n\nIn an attempt to shield myself from the harsh reality, I chose not to witness his passing. It was a difficult decision, but I believed it was in line with my father's values and my own sense of dignity. The days that followed were a blur as I grappled with the loss. The anticipation of a phone call that never came only added to my sense of isolation.",
            "In a paradoxical sense, the term 'Gothic Novel' can be seen as a contradictory entity, encapsulating the fusion of antiquity and modernity, as posited by Ian Watt's seminal work The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The genre has undergone a rollercoaster of perceptions, oscillating between being dismissed as superficial and lauded for its ability to evoke a sense of the sublime (as Burke astutely observed). Horace Walpole's inaugural 'Gothic Novel', The Castle of Otranto, ingeniously incorporated elements from both 'ancient' and 'modern' literary traditions, thus giving birth to the proto-Gothic genre. By blending 'old' theatrical conventions with the 'new' narrative structures of emerging novels, Walpole pioneered a unique literary style that he termed 'A Gothic Story' (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre draws heavily from medieval theatrical practices, architectural styles, and cultural heritage. Even when The Castle of Otranto was first published, the term 'gothic' was employed to describe a multitude of people, styles, and periods, often with a connotation of being outdated or unsophisticated in comparison to the rapidly evolving societal and literary landscape. The intriguing amalgamation of the theatrical 'Gothic' and the novel's innovative format, which allowed readers a more intimate glimpse into the psychological realm of characters, contributed to the genre's remarkable longevity and adaptability.\n\nOne of the pivotal elements of the Gothic novel is the notion of Chivalry, which permeates The Castle of Otranto and other works within the genre. The medieval ideal of chivalry, encompassing the development of a noble knight, serves as a recurring motif, both preserved and reinterpreted by Gothic writers, including Walpole. The reverence for the chivalric code, symbolizing bravery, honor, and competence, was especially significant to these authors, who perceived a growing disparity between the ideal and the reality of their own time. By incorporating chivalric ideals and mannerisms, the 'Gothic past' was romantically idealized, foreshadowing the evolution of the genre into Romanticism. In The Castle of Otranto, this is evident in the character of Frederic, who embodies many chivalric traits, as described in the text:\n\nThe description of Frederic highlights a plethora of chivalric attributes; he is a prince, beset by a series of tragic events, and is assumed to have fallen to the infidels. The image of the gallant and courteous knight is, however, somewhat exaggerated, introducing the trope of excess that would become a hallmark of the Gothic genre (66).",
            "The seamless orchestration of goods from raw materials to customer delivery is what defines supply chain management. This intricate dance of processes was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982, a strategic consultant who recognized the importance of streamlining the entire process to meet customer needs efficiently. At its core, supply chain management involves six pivotal components: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. These elements work in harmony to deliver unparalleled customer satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial phase, serves as the bedrock upon which the entire supply chain is built. It is here that production managers determine the optimal production plan, taking into account market trends and customer demand. Market analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences, allowing managers to make informed decisions about product offerings and quantities. The chosen production location must also be carefully selected, balancing factors such as volume and quality to meet customer expectations.\n\nEffective production planning is crucial, as it sets the tone for the entire supply chain. Scheduling and equipment maintenance are critical aspects of this stage, as any misstep can have far-reaching consequences for the company. For instance, companies like Wal-Mart and Target have developed meticulous processes for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. This level of scrutiny ensures that expectations are clear and direction is unambiguous, allowing for a smooth workflow.\n\nSupply, the second essential element, involves strategic planning to optimize facility capabilities and partnerships. Companies may choose to outsource certain processes to external partners, leveraging their strengths to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality products with flexibility while minimizing costs. By carefully evaluating internal divisions and external collaborations, managers can create a robust supply chain that meets customer needs while maintaining a competitive edge.",
            "Amidst the bustle of a Southeast Asian nation, a poignant statement hangs above the head of a lone figure, a cinematic actor renowned for her portrayal of Juno. Ellen Page stands resolute, her cardboard sign emblazoned with a stark message scrawled in bold letters. Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been under the iron-fisted grip of a military junta since 1962, its ascent to power marked by a coup d'état. In 2007, a wave of street protests shook the nation, sparked by a decade-long period of relative calm. Led by a fraternity of Burmese monks clad in their distinctive saffron-robed attire, these protests garnered widespread attention and earned the moniker \"The Saffron Revolution.\" As the protests gained momentum, the government's initial concession to allow peaceful gatherings soon gave way to a vicious cycle of violence, with the military launching a brutal crackdown on monasteries and targeting foreign journalists, including the tragic killing of Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai in 2007. Official reports estimated 13 fatalities, but Colonel Hla Win, a defector from the military, painted a haunting picture of a much higher death toll, with numerous bodies estimated to be in the thousands.\n\nThis phenomenon is not an isolated incident, nor is it a recent development. The urge to suppress dissent and maintain absolute control has been a persistent thread throughout human history. Ancient Roman emperors claimed divine right to rule, while Japanese emperors were revered as deities, ushering in an era of prosperity – albeit one marked by ritualistic self-sacrifice and technological advancements. In more contemporary times, the United States has seen its fair share of authoritarian tendencies, including the presidency of George W. Bush, whose alleged connections to Ted Haggard, a prominent figure in the Republican Party, have raised eyebrows.\n\nHistorical precedents abound, such as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where a confluence of intellectuals, labor activists, and students came together to challenge the Chinese government's authoritarian regime. The death toll in this instance remains shrouded in uncertainty, with official reports ranging from 200 to 300, while independent estimates suggest a staggering 2,000 to 3,000 fatalities. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s is another harrowing example, where Hutu militia groups, backed by the Rwandan government, systematically targeted Tutsis and moderate politicians, disregarding ethnic affiliations. The atrocities perpetrated during Hitler's Third Reich, a period marked by the mass persecution and extermination of Jews, serve as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.",
            "One of the key factors contributing to Duke Ellington's enduring legacy in the realm of jazz is his remarkable longevity and the resultant mastery of his craft. As a composer, Ellington frequently achieved a harmonious balance between subtle piano work and the individual talents of his orchestra members. By crafting frameworks that allowed for improvisation, Ellington not only showcased each musician's capabilities but also generated a dynamic interplay of sounds that elevated the ensemble as a whole. His orchestral compositions often seamlessly integrated diverse styles, underscoring the versatility and cohesion of his band.\n\nA prime example of Ellington's innovative approach can be found in Creole Love Call, a piece that exemplifies his use of voice as a melodic instrument. This early work showcases his ability to incorporate vocals without the constraints of lyrics, effectively enriching the sonic tapestry. Throughout his career, Ellington demonstrated a distinctive sensitivity to the unique styles of his soloists, as evident in his collaborations with various musicians.\n\nCreole Love Call is a 12-bar blues piece characterized by six distinct sections, each contributing to the rich narrative. Section one features a call-and-response dynamic between voice and reeds, which gradually transitions from a smooth tone to a more rugged quality. The second section presents a muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the melody, punctuated by extended blue notes. The third section showcases a sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\n\nThe subsequent sections build upon this foundation, with the full band echoing the first chorus through a call-and-response between the brass and reed sections. The fifth section reaches a climactic conclusion, as the reeds take center stage with a call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections. The final section returns to the initial structure, with the voice adopting the distinctive \"growl\" technique, soloing as an instrument.\n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant flourish by a trombone. This utilization of voice as a tone color adds a unique dimension to Ellington's work, a trait consistently evident throughout his compositions.\n\nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly merges his skill in orchestration with his acute sense of tone color. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing effectively combines the vocal and instrumental aspects of their performances. It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) further explores this concept, as Ellington skillfully employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton's trombone to introduce the melody in a captivating manner.",
            "She had long been plagued by an inexplicable void, a gnawing sense of incompleteness that had taken hold around the time she entered adolescence. Three years had passed since that initial feeling had arisen, and yet, it persisted, refusing to be satiated. The nature of this yearning had evolved over time, shifting from a desire for a tangible object to a deep-seated need for human connection. However, her lack of interest in the boys who had shown interest in her had left her questioning her own emotional landscape.\n\nAs a teenager, she often found herself pondering the reasons behind this peculiar phenomenon, trying to unravel the tangled threads of her emotions. The years of introspection had yielded various theories, but none had provided a satisfactory explanation for her emotional state. As a result, she continued to navigate life with a sense of disquiet, her mind repeatedly returning to this enigmatic void.\n\nHer upbringing had been marked by a sense of tranquility, thanks to her parents' calm and harmonious relationship. Arguments were rare in her household, and when they did occur, they were usually centered around her desire for independence and self-expression. Her parents' peaceful nature had been a stark contrast to her own effervescent personality, which had earned her a reputation as a lively and endearing individual.\n\nHowever, today was not a typical day. As she moved from room to room, searching for inspiration, she was jolted by a blood-curdling scream from the kitchen. Her mother's melodious voice was a stark contrast to the sound of distress that had pierced the air. She rushed into the kitchen, her heart racing with concern, and found her mother lying on the ground, writhing in pain. The daughter sprang into action, placing a supportive hand on her mother's shoulder as she exclaimed, \"Mom! What's wrong?\" Her mother's response was laced with urgency, \"Ow... sweetie, I... need you to get me to the hospital.\" The daughter's eyes widened with worry as she quickly assessed the situation and sprang into action.\n\nWith her mother directing her, she carefully lifted her into a seated position and guided her to the car, where she carefully settled her into the backseat. The drive to the hospital was a blur, her mind consumed by the need to ensure her mother's well-being. Upon arrival, the antiseptic scent and cacophony of sounds created a disorienting atmosphere, but her daughter's primary concern remained her mother's health. She quickly called for the medical staff, who swiftly responded with a sense of urgency, and her mother was attended to.\n\nIt transpired that her mother had suffered a fall from a step stool while attempting to retrieve a vase from a high cabinet.",
            "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the risk of chronic heart disease and stroke. The study focused on the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed), a modified version of the Mediterranean Diet, which emphasizes higher consumption of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and fish, and lower consumption of saturated fats and animal products. Moderate alcohol intake is also permitted.\n\nPrevious research has shown that adherence to the Mediterranean Diet is associated with a reduced risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. However, prior studies have not specifically examined the relationship between the Mediterranean Diet and stroke mortality. An earlier intervention trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean Diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles in obese individuals.\n\nThe present study involved 74,886 women aged 38-63 years, free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. The women completed six food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) from 1984 to 2004, which assessed their dietary habits over the preceding year. The response rate was over 95% across the 20-year study period. FFQs were validated through external reviews of medical records, autopsy reports, and death certificates. Cases of heart disease, fatal heart disease, and stroke were confirmed through these records, with approximately 17% of strokes and 24% of non-fatal myocardial infarctions classified as probable based on available information.\n\nAdditional variables, including body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy, were calculated for each FFQ. Leisure-time physical activity was also assessed, starting in 1986. To account for individual variability and long-term dietary patterns, cumulative averages of the aMed score were calculated from the repeated FFQs.\n\nThe analysis controlled for potential confounders, such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use. Cox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to investigate the association between the aMed score and risk of heart disease and stroke, using separate models for fatal and non-fatal events.\n\nThe results showed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and stroke. Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of heart disease, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk of both heart disease and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile, with a relative risk of 0.71.",
            "In 2007, the US economy hit a severe downturn, marked by a sharp increase in unemployment and a catastrophic collapse of the housing market. A significant number of major corporations suffered devastating losses, raising pressing questions about the causes and potential prevention of such a crisis. In essence, the financial debacle can be attributed to ill-conceived and short-sighted policy decisions that prompted banks and financial institutions to extend high-risk loans to consumers during a time of economic instability. Concurrently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac found themselves under intense pressure to invest in and repackage subprime mortgages as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs). When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the resulting financial strain was transferred to the repackaged securities, ultimately destabilizing the broader economy.\n\nThe roots of the financial crisis date back to the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration's efforts to secure a second term in office. To boost his popularity, the President relaxed lending regulations, potentially sowing the seeds of the subprime crisis that would materialize seven years later. A New York Times article from 1999 highlighted the issue, stating that Fannie Mae, the largest mortgage underwriter in the country, was facing pressure from the Clinton administration to expand its mortgage lending to low-income households while maintaining profitability. A prescient journalist, Steven Holmes, noted that this approach could lead to a government bailout similar to the one in the 1980s, predicting the severe economic consequences of such actions.\n\nA complex interplay of factors contributed to the economic downturn, including the widespread adoption of adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs. This web of financial instruments not only entwined various sectors of the economy with the housing market but also led to excessive leverage among US households and financial institutions. As a result, the economy became highly susceptible to even minor fluctuations in housing prices.\n\nWhen the housing bubble burst, financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities were severely impacted. In 2007, the top US investment banks collectively reported $4.1 trillion in mortgage debt, accounting for approximately 30% of the country's GDP. This led to the collapse of several major financial institutions, including Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers. Fannie and Freddie, meanwhile, accumulated $5 trillion in mortgage debt, prompting the government to take control in September 2008.",
            "The Art of Exposition: A Cautionary Tale\n\nFor writers, there exists a precarious balance between revealing the intricacies of a narrative and overwhelming the reader with unnecessary information. Dr. Emma Taylor dubs this crux the \"exposition conundrum.\" While attempting to guide readers through the labyrinth of backstory and details, writers often find themselves lost in a sea of exposition, only to have their audience grow disengaged.\n\nThe fundamental principle of \"show, don't tell\" is well-known, yet even seasoned writers like Dr. Taylor struggle to avoid lengthy passages that fail to advance the plot. Exposition, in essence, is the inclination to disclose significant information in a straightforward manner. This can manifest in the form of a character divulging an abrupt history lesson or the author itself taking the reins to convey crucial details.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, consider a narrative where a protagonist's husband is suddenly and tragically murdered. Rather than a meager two lines of dialogue, a more immersive experience would delve into the nuances of their relationship, allowing readers to empathize with the heroine's emotional response. A compelling character study of the husband, captured through his interactions, mannerisms, and dialogue, would not only enrich the narrative but also facilitate a deeper connection with the heroine. The audience would become invested in their fate, and, consequently, the story would gain depth.\n\nEffective exposition, therefore, requires a delicate balance between providing the essential framework of the narrative and crafting a rich tapestry of characters and their relationships. Writers must avoid the temptation to gloss over pivotal details, instead choosing to incorporate subtle hints and nuanced character development. This approach will not only captivate the reader but also prevent the narrative from devolving into a dry recitation of facts.\n\nAs a writer, one must resist the urge to rush through exposition, opting instead for a more considered approach. Take, for instance, the introduction of a new character. Rather than listing their extensive history, including their military background and personal aspirations, a more engaging method would be to gradually reveal these details through their actions, dialogue, and interactions. By doing so, the reader will become invested in the character's growth and development, much like the protagonist's journey.",
            "On August 13, 2011, I viewed two broadcasts from NBC 4 in Columbus, Ohio. The first breaking news segment, which aired live that morning, centered on a domestic violence incident in Ashley, Ohio. A local man, identified as Shad Hostettler, was taken into custody after allegedly stabbing his wife. Although the wife's name was not disclosed, her mug shot was briefly shown, and Hostettler's appearance was described in a straightforward manner. Given the story's developing nature, the two-minute coverage seemed proportionate.\n\nThe second story focused on an early morning shooting in the Sharon Woods area, which resulted in the critical injury of an 18-year-old male, Travis Buyers. The police investigation was ongoing, with no suspects identified at the time. The limited coverage of this story might have been due to various factors, including the circumstances surrounding the incident and the location. It's worth noting that crime stories involving individuals from diverse backgrounds often receive varying levels of attention in the media. This phenomenon is a pattern that I have observed over the years, where high-profile cases involving individuals from the majority demographic tend to receive more extensive coverage compared to those from minority groups.\n\nThe next segment reported on a bullet hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter. Authorities provided details about the suspected incident location and the type of firearm used, which was a .22 caliber rifle. A $5,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator.\n\nThe following story concerned weather forecasts for the upcoming weekend, with temperatures expected to range from the mid-to-low 80s. The brief coverage was likely intended to pique viewer interest and encourage continued viewing.\n\nAdditionally, a story about a robbery at a convenience store on Clime Road in Columbus was presented. The perpetrator, described as a tall, dark-skinned individual wearing a hooded sweatshirt, was still at large. It's worth noting that the emphasis on the perpetrator's appearance and skin tone seemed unusual.\n\nLastly, a segment highlighted the conviction of Rene Rodriguez, a prominent figure in a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation that spanned from Texas to Ohio. Instead of stating his sentence in years, the report mentioned 300 months. The inclusion of Rodriguez's Hispanic heritage seemed unnecessary, as it did not directly relate to the details of the case.",
            "The intricate, multifaceted relationship between brothers is a profound and often paradoxical bond. This connection is comprised of a complex array of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and a range of other conflicting sentiments. Brothers possess a unique understanding of one another, one that surpasses the comprehension of outsiders. This deep-seated connection allows them to see themselves reflected in their brother, fostering an unshakeable sense of self-awareness. The intensity of this bond is most evident in moments of desperation, when the true nature of their relationship is put to the test. The associated emotions can be both uplifting and devastating, carrying significant consequences that serve as a catalyst for growth and self-discovery.\n\nThe novel \"The Scarlet Ibis\" explores this theme through the complex dynamics between two brothers, as they navigate a treacherous landscape of emotions. Their futile journey is marked by a poignant clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, ultimately resulting in a tragic confrontation. Through the protagonist's direct characterization and interactions with his brother, as well as the narrator's omniscient perspective, the novel masterfully conveys the intricate emotions and perspectives that shape the protagonist's actions.\n\nA pervasive undercurrent of pride drives the protagonist's decisions, from his initial desire for a capable sibling to his ultimate actions. His vision of a brother who could share in his adventures and experiences is shattered by the reality of his brother's physical limitations. The protagonist's frustration and disappointment are palpable, as he grapples with the harsh realities of his brother's condition. However, a glimmer of hope emerges when he recalls the child's smile, highlighting the depth of his emotional connection to his sibling. This nuanced portrayal reveals a complex emotional landscape, marked by both altruistic and self-serving motivations.",
            "The human brain functions as a complex information-processing system, capable of intricate cognitive operations. As technology has evolved from rudimentary to sophisticated, so too have the analogies used to describe its workings. Initially, it was likened to a writing surface, then to a papyrus scroll, followed by a codex, and most recently, to a computer. While these analogies offer a foundation for understanding, it's essential to recognize their limitations, as they can lead to oversimplifications and misinterpretations.\n\nInformation processing commences with the sensory organs, which transmute physical stimuli into electrical signals. Sensory input, comprising touch, temperature, sound waves, or light, is repeatedly reworked by the brain's algorithms through both bottom-up and top-down processing. For instance, when gazing at an image of a black rectangle against a white backdrop, bottom-up processing aggregates fundamental information such as color, spatial orientation, and object boundaries to deduce that the shape is a box. Top-down processing, conversely, utilizes the decisions made during the bottom-up process to accelerate object recognition, allowing you to identify the shape as a distinct, self-contained entity – in this case, a black box – rather than a void or an indentation.\n\nOnce information has undergone a degree of processing, an attention filter determines its relative importance and allocates it to specific cognitive processes. As you look down at your shoes, for example, your brain processes each individual blade of grass, yet a healthy attention filter inhibits you from consciously perceiving them as distinct entities. In contrast, you might readily identify your name amidst background noise. The information processing pathway involves multiple stages, with attention modulating the results at every juncture.\n\nFor the brain to process information effectively, it must first store it. There are several types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods suited to various types of sensory stimuli. For instance, verbal input can be encoded based on visual appearance, phonetic properties, or semantic meaning. Subsequently, information must be maintained. Research on animal subjects suggests that working memory, which retains information for approximately 20 seconds, is sustained through an electrical signal that cycles through a specific sequence of neurons for a brief duration. The structure of certain proteins is hypothesized to maintain long-term memories.\n\nThere are numerous models of how knowledge is organized within the brain, each derived from various disciplines, including human cognition, computer science, and neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented by nodes, which are connected based on their affinity and relatedness. For example, in this model, the concept \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which is linked to \"wood,\" and so forth.",
            "In the dystopian society depicted in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, the convergence of technology and capitalist ideologies raises significant concerns. The novel's inhabitants prioritize communal interests over individual autonomy, with a focus on immediate gratification. From a young age, they are conditioned to pursue happiness without questioning the underlying social structure. This setup reveals the characters as pawns in a larger game, subject to the control of the World Controller, who dictates a single ideology.\n\nUpon analyzing the novel through a Marxist lens, it becomes apparent that Huxley critiques the emerging economic systems of his time. Key terms from Marxist theory, such as homogeny and reification, are embedded throughout the narrative, underscoring the author's apprehensions regarding the capitalist model. The concept of false consciousness is a particularly relevant example, as it illustrates how the masses are kept in the dark about their true economic relationships, preoccupied instead with personal gain.\n\nThe conditioning of the lower-class citizens, facilitated by hypnopædia, serves to reinforce this notion. Their desires are manipulated to prioritize consumption, indulgence, and materialism, effectively suppressing any awareness of the social hierarchy and their place within it. This manipulation is perpetrated by the World Controller, who maintains a grip on power through hegemony – the dominance of a particular group over others.\n\nThe novel's portrayal of social classes highlights the effects of capitalist oppression. The lower classes, exemplified by the Deltas and Gammas, are oblivious to their manipulation, while those in higher positions, including the Alphas and Betas, often acquiesce to their roles. Even characters like Bernard, who seem to be aware of the oppressive nature of the society, ultimately conform to their designated positions.\n\nThe novel's depiction of relationships is also noteworthy. The characters lack depth and individuality, suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism erode human agency and emotional expression. Interactions between individuals are superficial, characterized by the objectification of women and a focus on physical appearance. The complacency of the societal classes towards their positions in the hierarchy further underscores the socioeconomic effects of capitalism, as they prioritize conformity over autonomy.\n\nThe novel can be seen as a commentary on the ways in which capitalism can lead to a false sense of security among the proletariat, who are convinced of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal norms. Huxley's critique of capitalism serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked technological advancements and the consequences of a society that values consumption above all else.",
            "As a student at University Park for nearly three years, I've grown accustomed to navigating the campus's vast expanse. Getting from one end of the campus to the other can be a significant undertaking, particularly for those residing in outlying dormitories. My own experience as a freshman, housed in East Halls, highlights the challenges of traversing the campus. The considerable distance to classes in the Willard building, situated near the heart of campus, often necessitated a 25-minute walk, sometimes longer if inclement weather prevailed in State College. Engaging in conversation with an alumnus, I learned that the area surrounding East Halls was once characterized by extensive vacant land. This open space has since been transformed into sports facilities, modern buildings such as the Creamery and health services center, and nearby apartment complexes. As the university continues to expand, the difficulty of navigating the campus becomes increasingly pronounced. In this context, the bicycle emerges as a promising solution. However, a bike alone is insufficient; it requires regular use and a campus environment that accommodates the needs of cyclists.\n\nIn a conversation with a friend who had recently resumed cycling, I was struck by his sentiments: \"Bikes are great,\" he said, \"for a few years it wasn't trendy to ride a bike, but it's the only way to get around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling offers unparalleled efficiency, allowing one to cover distances of up to 30 miles on a bowl of oatmeal and moderate exercise. As an off-campus resident, I've come to appreciate the benefits of cycling. Specifically, I reside in a location equidistant from the campus center as some on-campus dormitories. The decision to purchase a bike has been one of my most prudent choices this year. With classes in Thomas building, a 25-minute walk from my residence, cycling can significantly reduce travel time to just 5 minutes, provided I pedal at a moderate pace. However, the most direct route to Thomas building, Pollock Road, can be challenging to navigate, regardless of mode of transportation. While walking offers its own set of advantages, I find myself too time-constrained to prioritize walking. Without my bike, walking would be my sole reliable option, requiring an additional 30-40 minutes each day. This translates to over two and a half hours per week, a considerable amount of time I can ill afford to dedicate to commuting. When considering the cumulative time spent walking to and from other classes, appointments, and activities, the total time would be substantial, undermining my academic productivity."
