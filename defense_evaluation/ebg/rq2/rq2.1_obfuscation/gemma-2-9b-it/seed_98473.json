            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My aspirations lie in the field of social work, specifically within the Division of Family and Children Services. I'm drawn to the opportunity to work directly with children who have experienced abuse or neglect, offering them support and guidance.  I believe my values align strongly with the core principles of social work: service, respect, ethical conduct, and a dedication to fostering healthier relationships.  These values are not merely professional ideals for me; they are deeply ingrained in my personal beliefs.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force, though my chosen path remained unclear for some time. Witnessing individuals grappling with personal challenges, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, fueled my desire to make a positive impact. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009.  While I continued to explore different career options after graduation, a pivotal encounter solidified my commitment to social work.\n\nDuring a summer visit with a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. His story deeply impacted me, prompting me to offer support.  I contacted the authorities and, despite their limited legal options,  I spoke with the boy's parents, expressing my concerns. Their evasive responses and attempts to dismiss the situation as \"simple\" solidified my resolve to pursue a career advocating for children in vulnerable situations. This experience highlighted the crucial role social workers play in protecting and supporting those facing familial challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply with me.  As a society, we often champion the importance of individual uniqueness while simultaneously conforming to societal norms. This paradox is something I've actively challenged throughout my life.  From expressing my individuality through unconventional fashion choices and advocating for marginalized communities to actively participating in protests against racism and discrimination, I've consistently strived to promote equality and social change.\n\nMy commitment to social justice is unwavering, and I believe it will guide my work as a social worker, empowering me to advocate for the rights and well-being of all individuals.",
            "This paper explores the biological and sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The biological lens centers on genetic predispositions and medical factors influencing sleep. Conversely, the sociocultural approach examines environmental influences, considering the impact of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into both models, analyzing relevant research to illuminate their complexities.  Each study's findings are critically evaluated, highlighting their strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary to mental disorders, or secondary to other medical conditions. Primary sleep disorders encompass dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias. These conditions primarily affect the initiation and maintenance of sleep.  Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve behavioral or physiological disturbances during sleep, such as nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and unspecified parasomnias. Sleep disorders secondary to mental disorders are linked to either Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review focuses primarily on insomnia, but will also briefly discuss primary sleep disorders in the context of both biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genes, inherited factors, and physiological mechanisms. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness.  One study investigated mice and discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically implicated in sleep-wake states. Activating these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep.  The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that findings from animal models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Disruptions or absence of this receptor could potentially impair sleep without medication.  From a sociocultural perspective, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep patterns. Alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting various aspects of life such as education, career, and daily tasks requiring focus and concentration.",
            "This exploration delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a concise explanation of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is elucidated, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes with strategies that educators in inclusive classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes the effectiveness and efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Defined narrowly, CAPD focuses on the perceptual processing of auditory input within the CNS, encompassing the neurobiologic activity underlying this processing and generating electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it signifies a condition where the central nervous system, specifically the brain, struggles to process auditory information effectively. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity; they are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" Instead, the brain region responsible for translating sound, distinguishing words, and separating speech from background noise may not function optimally.\n\nThe earliest documented reference to this disorder, which later evolved into CAPD, dates back to the mid-1950s, termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were examining children with communicative disorders at the time. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of tests for these children in 1954.  In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in diverse ways. Individuals with CAPD may have difficulty localizing or perceiving sound in spatial contexts. They might struggle to differentiate between two or more distinct sound occurrences. Recognizing sound patterns or discerning changes in speech, such as sarcasm conveyed through variations in tone, could also pose a challenge. One sound might be masked by a subsequent sound, hindering their ability to process it.  Furthermore, they may struggle to synthesize auditory cues, interpreting them meaningfully to guide their actions.  Finally, determining the sequence of auditory information may be a challenge for individuals with CAPD.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes systematic observation of listening behaviors and/or performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. These professionals utilize a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills.  Evaluations may encompass questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including the individual's responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate. Moreover, the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, like a series of words or numbers. More sophisticated tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a potent tool for deception, its prolonged use can lead to a loss of self.  The act of revealing one's true identity, however, often carries the risk of social alienation. Ultimately, individuals must grapple with a difficult choice: prioritize their own authenticity or preserve their relationships, even if it means facing potential hurt or rejection from those around them. The play acknowledges that reactions to exposure can vary; some may remain unaffected, while others may be deeply offended by the deception.\n\nThe play's exploration of gender disguise adds another layer of complexity. It raises questions about the reasons behind individuals assuming identities that contradict their biological sex. In Viola's case, her decision to present herself as a man, Cesario, stems from a need for self-preservation in a foreign and potentially hostile environment.  As she states, she relied on the \"gentle help\" of her female attire to protect herself. (5.1.247-249) While this strategy proves effective, it also isolates her from female companionship, severing her from a vital support system.\n\nThe effectiveness of Viola's disguise becomes even more pronounced when Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, falls in love with her.  (\"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" 5.1.138)  This situation adds another layer of complexity to Viola's predicament, as she simultaneously navigates her own suppressed feelings for Orsino, who expresses his affection for her in her male guise. (\"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" 5.1. 260-261)\n\nDespite its potential to seem progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on the unveiling of suppressed emotions through deception.  The characters of Olivia and Orsino seem to grapple with unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's presence as Cesario.  It raises questions about the nature of Olivia's attraction to Cesario: is it based solely on his perceived masculinity, or does it hint at deeper, perhaps subconscious, feelings for women? While some might argue that Olivia's character is a satire of those who judge solely on appearances, her swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian, coupled with her acceptance of Viola as a sister rather than a love interest (\"A sister, you are she.\" 5.1.315), complicates this interpretation.",
            "The impact of German colonialism has been widely acknowledged for its harsh realities, particularly regarding the tragic events that befell the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa.  However, it's crucial to remember that such a vast colonial endeavor as Germany's cannot be solely defined by a single narrative.  The German empire exhibited a wide range of governing approaches and policies across its diverse territories, mirroring the geographical variations it encompassed.  \n\nSimilarly, educational initiatives implemented within these colonies displayed a spectrum of approaches. When British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German educational efforts. Contemporary writers also commended German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies.  \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a starkly different picture.  Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established public schools and played a central role in educating the native population, South West Africa saw the responsibility of native education largely delegated to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  Despite this, the German government did invest considerable resources in the education of European residents within the colony, developing a system of public schools and providing substantial backing and oversight for missionary schools. The lasting consequences of these educational policies in South West Africa were profound, extending even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies witnessed significant literacy and educational attainment among Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, with the majority of its population lacking education and literacy. \n\nThis discrepancy in educational outcomes can be attributed to a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in greater depth.  A particular focus will be placed on newly available research that sheds light on the attitudes and perspectives of both colonial authorities and settlers towards the native African population.\n\n\nA wealth of academic material addresses the topic of education within the German colonial empire.  A significant proportion of these sources are in German and originate from the early twentieth century, encompassing the period of direct German colonial rule.  The initial emphasis of these works was primarily descriptive, outlining the key features of educational systems across the colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of the educational landscape.  These studies consistently highlighted the significant variations in educational approaches across different colonies. \n\nCohen's study, which specifically focuses on education in both South West Africa and East Africa, stands out as a particularly relevant work for this paper. Cohen meticulously compares the educational systems of these two colonies, investigating the underlying factors responsible for their distinct characteristics.  Cohen posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a primary driver behind many of the unique features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonial holdings, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although a significant portion of the territory is characterized by arid desert. This relatively favorable environment attracted a larger European population to South West Africa.  By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, a figure significantly higher than the 5,336 Europeans living in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The realm of popular music has witnessed a remarkable expansion in its classification over the past century, encompassing a vast array of genres that are nearly impossible to enumerate exhaustively.  Adding to this complexity, most, if not all, established genres, including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into multiple subgenres and sub-subgenres. Over the last 40 years, the subgenre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive forms within popular music. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though these often lean towards the darker end of the emotional scale.  \n\nHeavy Metal's diversity is equally notable, as its inception sparked a wave of experimentation and innovation. Artists quickly recognized the genre's inherent flexibility and began crafting their own unique subgenres, which in turn gave rise to further subdivisions, creating a branching network of styles that continues to evolve today.\n\nWe now find ourselves at a juncture where the heavy metal movement encompasses a plethora of distinct niches, making it challenging to precisely define its boundaries. While it has absorbed influences from various other genres, its origins remain firmly rooted in a specific cultural context. To truly comprehend the diverse landscape of heavy metal music prevalent today, one must first delve into the nature of the movement itself, understanding why it transcends the confines of a mere genre label.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement characterized by a distinct aesthetic of darkness. It can be perceived as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. It embraces technical proficiency, moving away from primitivism and highlighting the virtuosity of the musicians. It is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement profoundly influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s fueled a wave of creative exploration, resulting in music that pushed the boundaries of convention and experimentation.\n\nThis dark, visceral quality was a departure from the prevailing trends in popular music, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of human emotion.  Subsequent generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's exploration of darkness and emotional intensity. Lyrics often reflect this thematic preoccupation:\n\n(Byrne)\n\n\n These lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles exemplify the darker side of their musical output, capturing a sense of emotional turbulence that some interpret as a reflection of drug-induced experiences. This song is considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of Heavy Metal, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, more intense music. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their own capacity for sonic aggression, incorporating this darker element into \"The White Album.\"",
            "Long before the Surrealist movement captivated the art world with its dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist artist, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a masterpiece from 1910, embodies not just a woman in awe of a fantastical landscape, but also Rousseau's personal aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and validation from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. This desire, however, presented him with a profound internal conflict.  The painting serves as a poignant reflection of Rousseau's lifelong struggle: should he conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain approval from the esteemed art world he deeply admired, or should he embrace his unique creative vision and forge his own path?\n\nTo fully grasp the layers of meaning within \"The Dream,\" it's essential to understand Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in the French town of Laval in 1844, Rousseau's upbringing was far removed from the world of art. His father, a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer, offered no formal art education. Instead, Rousseau dedicated his early years to working for the French government as a toll collector, although he was mistakenly labeled a customs inspector. The tragic loss of his wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only his daughter, Julia, and an overwhelming sense of grief.  In painting, he sought solace, a fresh start, and an escape from his profound sorrow. Compared to his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau's work resonated with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for acceptance within the art world can be attributed to several factors.  Unburdened by formal art training and embarking on his artistic journey later in life, he found himself competing with a generation of talented and already established modern artists.  Despite years of dedicated work, recognition eluded him until roughly the same time that Matisse began to rise to prominence. As art historian Jan Gordon notes in \"Modern French Painters,\" while Matisse and Rousseau were stylistic rivals, their motivations for painting differed significantly.  \"Matisse feared painting in a trite manner, while Rousseau's ambition was to create a conventional picture that would secure him a place within the prestigious Artiste Français,\" (92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental link between truth and beauty. This belief stems from an intuitive understanding that resonates with our experiences. As John Keats aptly stated in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" \n\nWhile we acquire much of our knowledge through formal education or direct experiences, our appreciation for both ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional learning pathways.  Both disciplines, in essence, strive to illuminate rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty predominantly aim to decipher the reasons behind a work of art's allure or an action's ethical merit, rather than establish rigid rules for artistic creation or moral conduct. \n\nFurthermore, the critique of art or morality often falls short of fully capturing the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty.  Discussions surrounding the significance of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa,\" for instance, might delve into elements like composition, lighting, or historical context, yet these factors ultimately fail to encapsulate its artistic value.  When asked about a cherished artwork or literary piece, individuals frequently express a sentiment akin to, \"There's just something about it\" before elaborating further.  \n\nI contend that both art and ethics possess an inherent quality that transcends mere description.  Flannery O'Connor aptly remarked that \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how comprehensively we analyze the features of a literary work, a certain ineffable element remains.  \n\nI propose that ethics shares this characteristic.  Wittgenstein's assertion that \"Ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental\" supports this notion. It is this elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that constitutes the most compelling attribute of art and morality, and this transcendental nature serves as a bridge between the two.\n\nI believe the profound connection between morality and art stems from our profound, often inexpressible, engagement with them. They touch us at a level that transcends rational explanation, a notion aligned with Kant's concept of the noumenal. This link is particularly potent in the realm of literature. As McKean aptly notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its distinct culture woven into the very fabric of its landscape. From the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the coastal city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea, a shared identity resonates.  This cultural tapestry is further enriched as one travels along the Rhine River, passing through Cologne and reaching the historic city of Dresden nestled on the Elbe River in Saxony. This unique cultural blend is a testament to Germany's complex origins, stemming from a multitude of ancient tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people, Germania, carries a name shrouded in historical debate. Scholars and historians alike grapple with its true etymology.  Tacitus, a Roman historian, attributed the name to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe who, according to his writings, bore the name \"Germans\" prior to their crossing of the Rhine and subsequent conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine from the subjugated Gauls.  He adopted the word from the Gauls themselves, highlighting the distinction between the two groups (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Some theorize that \"Germanus\" originated from a Gaulish word denoting a neighbor, while others suggest it derives from a spear known as a \"ger\" used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010).  Another possibility is that it stems from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying a perception of the Germans as loud and boisterous (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his influential AD 98 work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germanic people, stating that \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania remained complex. While the Romans engaged in trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely refrained from extensive colonization.  Instead, the Germanic tribes flourished on the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and utilizing their skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "My gaze fell downward, my mind processing the scene before me with a detached clarity. Thoughts flitted in and out, a rapid stream of consciousness that felt more like observation than genuine reflection. It was as though I were observing my own mind working, dissecting the image without truly engaging with it.  \n\nOnce, influenced by an artist I collaborated with, I acquired a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" A lifelong desire to draw had led me to its pages, eager to unravel the mysteries of pencil strokes and the brain's interpretation of lines.  The book encouraged a technique where an artist frames a picture with an imaginary square, simplifying complex compositions. Transforming a bustling kitchen scene, for example, into a singular focus on a bowl of fruit.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't conjure that artist's frame. I was overwhelmed, captivated, unable to do anything but simply look. Picasso had his blue period, Monet, his love for greens, and the Renaissance masters, their vibrant palettes. If I dared to dream of an artistic identity, this felt like the genesis of my work, the start of my own narrative, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers touched the chosen tool of my craft, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my thoughts taking form.  It could have been a moment of pure creation. Water swirled, smooth and clear, a serene dance of movement.  Particles detached, carried away to nothingness.  With increasing tension, my hand jerked, a spasm of anxiety, slamming the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown object refused to budge, clinging stubbornly to the bottom.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet planted, my green tie a constricting band around my neck, I frowned at the offensive package left as a message for the unfortunate souls tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid bathrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and my hand reached for the wall, gripping the roll of toilet paper. I began wrapping myself in it, mimicking an oven mitt.  Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped into the bowl, like a mother entering an oven to retrieve a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming rate of fatalities involving young drivers demands our attention.  A confluence of factors contributes to this grim reality, posing a significant challenge to the safety of our youngest motorists. Research conducted by the National Institutes of Health highlights a crucial aspect of the problem: the adolescent brain is not yet fully developed to handle the complexities and dangers inherent in driving.  In addition to this neurological immaturity, inexperience plays a pivotal role.  \n\nThis lack of experience not only elevates the risk of fatal accidents but also increases the likelihood of rollovers, speeding incidents, and driving off the road.  Furthermore, studies, such as those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, have demonstrated a clear correlation between the presence of teen passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.  \n\nWhile some states have implemented measures like provisional licenses, which restrict driving hours and passenger limitations for young drivers, these are, in my view, merely temporary solutions.  The core issue lies in the inherent limitations of adolescent drivers, as evidenced by statistical data.  \n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman, a prominent psychologist, argues that even the age of 18 is too young to grant full driving privileges.  His research, as reported by USA Today, suggests a common inclination among individuals under the age of 20 to engage in risky behavior for the sheer thrill of it.  Therefore, delaying the onset of driving until this inherent risk-taking tendency diminishes seems prudent.  \n\nContinued issuance of driver's licenses to young teenagers will inevitably result in a tragic escalation of accidents and fatalities. This concern is amplified by the impending influx of new teen drivers as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.  By 2010, millions of these new drivers will be eager to take to the road.\n\nAddressing this urgent issue requires comprehensive legislative action.  Driver's education, a cornerstone of responsible driving, can continue to be provided in schools, but the minimum age for obtaining a driver's license should be raised to 18.  Provisional permits could still be issued, leading to full licensure after a certain number of supervised driving hours, similar to the existing regulations in many states, such as California's requirement of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nThe implementation of uniform, nationwide legislation would effectively address this issue, safeguarding the well-being of young drivers across the nation. The proposed legislation is not without precedent, as similar measures have been explored and debated in various forums.",
            "My exploration of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films led me to examine a fascinating group of fifteen \"trick films\" produced between 1895 and 1901. These films, characterized by their reliance on creative editing techniques, aimed to create captivating visual illusions. My analysis focused primarily on identifying the common stylistic elements present in the majority of these trick films, while also highlighting the unique characteristics exhibited by a select few produced later in the period.\n\nA prevailing trend in trick films of this era was their confined setting within a frontal proscenium. These films typically displayed no camera movement, opting instead for long and medium shots that adhered to a strict one-shot-equals-one-film principle. However, it's worth noting that some films from the early twentieth century dared to deviate from these conventions, incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most distinctive features shared by these trick films is their utilization of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary within this proscenium, refraining from following characters or objects as they moved. This compositional style, common in early cinema, drew inspiration from the theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts.  A limitation inherent in this stage-bound approach is that the characters in trick films generally move only side to side, without progressing towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even as they exit the frame, the camera does not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also contributed to the prevalence of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-up shots were absent from all the trick films examined in the Edison catalog. This mirrored the theatrical and vaudeville tradition, where the audience viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage boundaries. As actors in these early films typically remained in the middle ground and did not approach the camera, close-up shots were rarely used.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films adhered to the principle that one conceptual shot equaled one film. This convention limited the length of most trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second employed. It also constrained the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which primarily focused on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and quick exchanges with minimal storyline.\n\nIt's important to note that a \"shot\" in a trick film, from the viewer's perspective, does not always equate to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might actually consist of several segments joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For instance, a closer examination of \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals the point where the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single shot to the viewer.",
            "A prominent figure in the early Republican movement, John Taylor of Caroline, was deeply passionate about the ideals of self-governance and individual liberty. His background in agriculture, coupled with his brief foray into politics, shaped his persona as a man known for his staunch convictions and outspoken advocacy for personal freedoms and limited government intervention. Taylor's agrarian worldview served as the foundation for his political philosophy, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.  He believed that the nascent United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an exemplary system of government, free from the constraints of pre-existing traditions.  This absence of historical precedent, he argued, allowed for the creation of a truly self-governing nation.  Taylor was a fervent believer in the inherent rights of individuals, emphasizing their interdependence –  a notion that if one right was compromised, the entire fabric of liberty would weaken.  He argued that these fundamental rights should be protected from governmental encroachment.  \n\nTaylor viewed the so-called \"state of nature\" as a scenario where those with physical strength and cunning exploited the vulnerable.  He maintained that civilization, however, should strive to transcend this natural order, ensuring fairness and equity for all.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledged the duality of human nature – both its inherent goodness and its potential for evil. He held firm to a strict dualistic moral framework, asserting that government, being an extension of humanity, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices.  Taylor defined virtuous principles as those that safeguarded private property, fostered agricultural development, and tempered the excesses of capitalism. He believed that a government grounded in such principles could function effectively regardless of the individuals who held power, which he believed would always be susceptible to avarice and self-interest.   \n\nWhile acknowledging that self-interest was a fundamental human drive, Taylor viewed it as a problematic force when it transcended the common good and led to the creation of sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others.  He argued that a well-constructed government was essential to contain these negative tendencies and, even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the erosion of its principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor championed a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly delineated within its text.  He feared that an expansive federal government would be both financially burdensome and prone to tyranny.  However, Taylor cautioned against a purely literal interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it risked obscuring the intent of its framers and paving the way for corruption.  He further asserted that the Declaration of Independence served as the true founding document of the United States, as it more explicitly articulated the nation as a federation of sovereign states rather than a single, unified entity.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This downturn was somewhat concerning, and the precise cause remains unclear. Several factors could have contributed to this trend. \n\nThe onset of winter at a New England university likely impacted commuting patterns, as bicycle and pedestrian traffic naturally decreases during colder months. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a time of intense academic focus and final preparations. Amidst this flurry of activity, maintaining consistent participation in the commuter log initiative may have been challenging.  Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which campus presence is significantly reduced. This extended absence could explain the low log submissions in January as well. However, the continued low engagement in February suggests additional factors at play.\n\nIt's possible that the initial enthusiasm surrounding the project naturally waned over time, a common phenomenon in any new initiative. To counteract this potential decline, we implemented the \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, a concentrated effort to revitalize participation. This campaign successfully resulted in a noticeable increase in log submissions. \n\nTherefore, a key challenge we encountered was sustaining project momentum, addressing both the inherent ebb and flow of engagement and the unique disruptions caused by academic breaks and holidays inherent to higher education.\n\nAnother challenge, common to any alternative commuting project, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use.  To encourage participation, we offered a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses, aiming to provide tangible incentives for adopting alternative transportation. While these incentives proved effective, it's interesting to speculate on the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or even electric cars. These more substantial rewards could have potentially mitigated the decline in engagement. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, a dynamic approach, gradually increasing the value of prizes over time, might have yielded more sustained interest.",
            "Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, much like index funds. However, ETFs offer enhanced flexibility, trading on stock exchanges just like individual stocks.  This allows investors to benefit from the diversification of index funds while enjoying the advantages associated with stock ownership, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractional shares.  Despite these appealing attributes, it's important to note that ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.  A potential drawback is the presence of trading commissions on ETF transactions, similar to stock purchases.\n\nOne of the notable strengths of ETFs lies in their broad selection.  While the stated benefits are readily apparent, discerning investors should always critically assess whether these benefits, particularly diversification, are truly realized and to what extent. This analysis will focus on the ETF IHF, comparing its performance to the top ten holdings that constitute its portfolio.  The aim is to determine if the purported advantages of owning a single ETF compare favorably to those of owning a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks. Additionally, we'll explore alternative stock configurations that could potentially yield a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\nFor the sake of manageability, we'll concentrate on the top ten holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  A breakdown of these holdings and their respective asset percentages is provided below.\n\nTo gauge the extent to which these ten stocks represent the overall performance of the IHF ETF, we can utilize the current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their individual contributions to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return.  This hypothetical portfolio would be composed entirely of these ten stocks, held in the proportions reflected in the ETF's holdings. The calculated beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Furthermore, the beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole.  Based on these preliminary results, a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings appears to offer the potential for higher returns coupled with a reduced beta. However, it's essential to consider the possibility that the observed differences between these two portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo ascertain whether these portfolios exhibit statistically significant differences, we will determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks. These standard deviations will be normalized to 100% for comparative purposes, allowing us to assess their cumulative standard deviation relative to that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" among his more accomplished poetic works. Within the poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" on two occasions, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by Poe scholar, Mabbott. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, believed by the ancient Greeks to mark the edge of the known world. While Virgil's usage is documented, it's worth noting that Poe's familiarity with the term might have stemmed from contemporary German literature. \n\nPoe was deeply interested in German authors, and this influence is evident in his work.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's poem and the works of German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, suggesting that Poe might have been inspired by Goethe's writings.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a renowned figure in literary circles, particularly for his two-part poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in 1808 and 1832, the latter coinciding with Goethe's death.  Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This narrative centers on a king who, after his wife's death following a gift of a goblet, descends into despair through heavy drinking and mourning.  Driven by grief, he relinquishes his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, before ultimately choosing to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean and leaping from a cliff. The emotional state and demeanor of the King of Thulé resonate with the speaker's portrayal in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" potentially mirroring Poe's own personal struggles and coping mechanisms.  Furthermore, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a production occurring just a year before Poe used the term \"Thulé\" in his own work, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's engagement with the concept of \"Thulé\" is notable. While he uses \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the term twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem's beginning and end.  Both \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces, sharing thematic and emotional parallels. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape in Thulé, characterized by darkness, solitude, haunting memories, and a world devoid of color, mirroring the emotional desolation of the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem, who has lost his wife, his will to rule, and his desire to live.  \n\nGiven his admiration for Tennyson, it is highly probable that Poe would have been acquainted with Goethe's work, which was experiencing a surge in popularity after its initial publication.",
            "The potential for punitive damages in a case involving a customer's injury from a slip and fall due to an applesauce spill in a California grocery store presents a compelling legal question.  \n\nA judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss a claim for punitive damages brought by Jennifer Palmer.\n\nTo successfully argue for punitive damages, Palmer must demonstrate that the store manager, Martin, acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm his actions could cause. Evidence suggesting Martin's awareness of prior slip-and-fall incidents at the store, coupled with his inaction despite being informed of the spill twice, could support this claim.  While the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less straightforward, it remains plausible given the history of similar incidents and his failure to prioritize customer safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin to an applesauce spill. Martin, however,  claimed he was on his dinner break and declined to address the issue.  Tragically, just fifteen minutes later, Palmer slipped and sustained a serious back injury.  Prior to this incident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store that year. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages against D&D Markets for her injuries.\n\nCalifornia law allows for punitive damages in cases where a defendant's conduct demonstrates \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" and is not related to a contractual obligation.  \"Malice\" in this context refers to conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and carried out with a conscious disregard for the safety and rights of others.  Courts have recognized \"malicious\" conduct as encompassing situations where a defendant is aware of potential dangers resulting from their actions and intentionally chooses to ignore them.",
            "During my studies at CBC, I encountered a course on Islam that sparked considerable debate within the class. One central question that emerged, and one that feels even more pertinent today, was the nature of Islam as a religion – specifically, whether it inherently promotes hostility.  \n\nObserving the media landscape since 9/11, I've witnessed a dramatic shift in portrayal. Initially, Islam and its adherents, particularly extremists, were often presented negatively. Now, however, there seems to be a pendulum swing towards an almost excessive tolerance, a trend that feels somewhat unprecedented.  \n\nConsider the fact that in 2001, a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, whose family history demonstrably includes Muslim roots, would have likely faced significant public scrutiny. This suggests a noticeable evolution in societal perceptions.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad deeply intrigued me, presenting a seemingly paradoxical picture. Based on my prior understanding of his historical context, I had formed an image of Muhammad as a forceful leader who, through conquest, imposed Islam upon conquered tribes. However, the biography paints a different portrait – that of a misunderstood martyr, even one who humbled himself before others. It suggests a gradual awakening, where individuals, drawn to his teachings, sought him out, recognizing the \"truth\" he embodied.\n\nThere are intriguing parallels between Muhammad's ministry and the narratives surrounding Jesus's miracles. One striking example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk, providing sustenance for a large group of forty men. This stylistic choice, I believe, aims to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who didn't seek to prove himself but lived authentically, guided by miracles. I find this approach problematic, as it arguably diminishes the unique significance of Jesus's miracles. It feels as if an attempt is being made to subtly equate the two figures, potentially even appropriating aspects of Jesus's life and persona for Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography frequently employs anecdotal accounts, often relayed through multiple intermediaries. While these stories are intended to offer evidence of individuals' independent conversions to Islam, the reliance on secondhand information weakens their credibility. This layering of sources raises doubts and detracts from the stories' impact.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure – humble, wise, gentle, and endearing. This portrayal contrasts starkly with historical accounts that challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble individual. I can't help but wonder if Muslims today, privy to a more nuanced understanding of Muhammad's rise to power, might hold differing views.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought following Jesus's life presents a fascinating trajectory.  While his original teachings served as a foundation, subsequent developments within the faith have undeniably diverged from its earliest expressions.  Observing this historical progression, one discerns a noticeable shift towards greater intellectual and societal liberalization.  Despite the inherent resistance to change often displayed by traditionalists, their influence may prove insufficient to halt this broader trend.\n\nThe future holds the promise of a burgeoning awareness within the Christian community, a growing desire to differentiate between doctrines that have emerged over time and the core tenets espoused by Jesus himself.  This yearning for historical clarity, though perhaps spanning decades or even centuries, is likely to yield an inevitable outcome: a significant reversal in the course of Christian history.  \n\nImagine a movement gaining momentum, systematically dismantling layers of accumulated doctrine, akin to rewinding a clock, until only the essence of Jesus's original message, unadulterated by later interpretations, remains.  As this tide sweeps across nations like the United States and Europe, inspiring widespread adherence to Jesus's teachings, the institutional Church will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in guiding this transformation.  However, this theological regression will paradoxically usher in a period of increased uniformity within Christendom.  \n\nThe vast diversity that currently characterizes the Christian landscape will gradually give way to greater homogeneity of belief and practice.  Regional, denominational, and sectarian distinctions will fade, replaced by a renewed emphasis on shared core values.  \n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals.  The Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually embraced Christianity as its state religion.  Within our own nation, the trajectory from African-American slavery to African-American leadership exemplifies this phenomenon.  The impending reversion within the Christian faith will similarly unfold, retracing its steps to the source, while simultaneously diminishing its present-day diversity.\n\nA crucial factor in this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus's words as metaphorical, rather than literal pronouncements.  This shift in perspective will pave the way for a deeper understanding of his message and its enduring relevance.\n\nTracing the origins of Christianity, we encounter Judaism, the faith that served as its theological progenitor.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established itself as a monotheistic religion, with divinely revealed scriptures and a strong sense of authority.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" delves into the darker facets of human nature, suggesting that beneath the surface, individuals are driven by a powerful, often selfish, desire for personal gain. The characters inhabiting Sinclair's world demonstrate a stark prioritization of self-interest, often at the expense of those less fortunate.\n\nThis is most prominently illustrated in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their ambition knows no bounds, relentlessly pursuing expansion and profit, unconcerned with the human cost of their endeavors. Sinclair's vivid imagery, like the \"line of buildings standing clear-cut and black against the sky,\" juxtaposes the stark industrial landscape with the relentless pursuit of economic progress. The accompanying \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\" serves as a potent symbol of the environmental and societal consequences ignored in the pursuit of wealth.\n\nThe callous disregard for worker well-being is equally apparent.  The factory environment is characterized by \"jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  Employees are subjected to grueling hours and the constant threat of arbitrary layoffs, with no safety net or recourse.  The absence of worker protections during this era allowed factory owners to operate with impunity, exploiting their workforce and creating a system where survival itself was precarious.  \n\nEven the attempts at collective action, through unions, were often compromised, further highlighting the power imbalance and leaving workers trapped in a cycle of exploitation. The stark comparison to chattel slavery underscores the dehumanizing conditions endured by those who lived and worked in Packingtown, their lives consumed by the relentless demands of the industrial system.",
            "Numerous authors employ diverse strategies to evoke specific sentiments or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of these methods in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\"  He frequently juxtaposes adjectives and nouns that don't conventionally align, thereby imbuing subjects with a particular aura. Additionally, he ascribes meaning to symbols and subsequently leverages them for a similar purpose. Fitzgerald prominently employs this latter technique with various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.  Within \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald meticulously constructs symbolic meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to evoke specific feelings associated with pivotal objects.\n\nThe connotation Fitzgerald cultivates and employs for white/gray is that of homogeneity, with white representing a refined and elevated status, while gray signifies an older, more faded aspect. He establishes this association early in the novel through consistent depictions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone seems perpetually clad in white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instance where individuals deviate from white attire occurs during Nick's perception of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further refines the significance of these two colors by associating them with commonplace, unassuming subjects. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's party guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. Catherine's apartment is characterized as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). He also portrays ordinary people or locations using white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19). The valley of ashes boasts \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23). The \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing sufficient meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald utilizes them to signify insignificance or uniformity in relation to certain subjects. This application of color symbolism to reveal underlying meanings commences with Daisy. Following a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald portrays Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to perceive Daisy less as a multifaceted character and more as a uniform element, a mere object of Gatsby's desire (74). Fitzgerald amplifies this impression of Daisy's uniformity through further instances, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County enjoys a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant, sunny climate.  Popular crops grown in the region include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.  There's a significant demand for organic, community-supported agriculture products in the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand.  Many organic farms offer tours, allowing visitors to learn about agricultural practices while enjoying recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. \n\nThis type of operation presents an opportunity for landowners to leverage government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat quality, thereby creating avenues for farm tours, educational programs, and additional income streams.\n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming practices often lead to increased biodiversity in both plants and wildlife. This is attributed to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more expensive than conventional methods in certain aspects.  It requires more hands-on labor and management to control pests, weeds, and fertilize the soil naturally.  Losses are often higher compared to conventional methods, and smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale found in larger operations.\n\nPractices that benefit wildlife, even if not directly related to organic farming, can also increase labor costs.  These practices include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotation, managing invasive species, and actively cultivating plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edges or open areas. \n\nTherefore, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance in maximizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land, a 160-acre parcel adjacent to Potrero, California, encompasses chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, it falls under the purview of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Currently under review, this plan identifies over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened. These include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. \n\nThis area holds historical significance, having been inhabited by Native Americans for generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. This particular land parcel, originating from an early homestead patent, likely served as grazing land and/or a source of wood for many years.\n\nTo illustrate potential pathways for a small farmer, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to determine feasible options for cost mitigation and wildlife conservation.  As a practical example, I identified an existing organic farm in the same region to demonstrate achievable goals.",
            "Cultural nuances significantly impact any negotiation process. Culture, more than a fixed entity, is a dynamic interplay of shared values, beliefs, and practices. It's crucial to recognize that generalizations about entire cultures, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are overly simplistic and potentially misleading. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a successful negotiator delves deeper, understanding the specific cultural context of the situation and how it might influence interactions at the negotiating table. \n\nWhen encountering a new culture, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own cultural background. However,  attempting to truly grasp another culture involves a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical understanding, awareness of potential biases, and a willingness to accept cultural differences without judgment. Rather than trying to change or impose one's own cultural norms, it's essential to work within the boundaries of the other culture, especially when in a weaker negotiating position.  Respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territories can be instrumental in overcoming cultural barriers and fostering productive dialogue.\n\nIt's important to remember that cultural influences extend beyond national borders.  Within a single nation, diverse corporate cultures can emerge, shaping work environments and interactions.  These differences manifest in various ways, including dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), delegation practices, and even employee engagement in philanthropic activities.  Examining the spectrum of American corporate cultures, from region to region and urban to suburban settings, highlights the richness and complexity of cultural influences within a single society.  While some cultures might appear more homogenous on the surface, a deeper exploration often reveals a surprising degree of internal diversity.\n\nValues serve as the foundation of a culture, providing the underlying \"why\" behind its practices. Understanding these core values is crucial for successful negotiation. For example, cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony might discourage public criticism or confrontation, even in negotiations. Conversely, cultures that value assertive bargaining might prioritize securing the best possible deal, potentially delaying a settlement.  \n\nWhile recognizing these cultural tendencies is essential, a negotiator should also strive to understand their counterpart on a personal level to build rapport and enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’”  found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This belief, which we will explore in relation to another prominent theologian, Thomas Aquinas, posits the existence of a specific God – the God of the Bible.  To ensure a meaningful comparison of their arguments, we will proceed under the assumption that both Anselm and Aquinas hold this conviction. \n\nAnselm's approach to understanding God emphasizes introspection and faith. He argues that God's existence is inherent within our comprehension, and the very act of conceiving Him necessitates His reality. While Anselm's phrasing can be intricate, the core idea is that the proof for God resides within our own minds. Essentially, he suggests that the truth about God is accessible through an examination of our own internal understanding, rendering external evidence superfluous. This concept, often referred to as faith in religious contexts, involves accepting truths that lack concrete, empirical validation.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas offers a distinctly different perspective. He contends that God's existence can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, bypassing the need for faith. This rational approach holds significant appeal for evangelism, as it could potentially attract new adherents by appealing to logic rather than requiring a leap of faith. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument hinges on the idea that the existence of God is a logical necessity, akin to deducing the existence of a missing puzzle piece based on the assembled fragments.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to become known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned earthly possessions and achieved enlightenment. His teachings ultimately gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. This religion, approximately two and a half millennia old, has evolved considerably since Buddha's time. This transformation is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Both monks and lay practitioners participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning any such celebration. These deviations extend from surface-level customs to the very essence of the religion's salvation doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist community, both within the monastic sphere and among lay followers, has undergone doctrinal shifts over time. These changes can be attributed to both internal and external influences, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently employ specific terminology. \"Internal\" refers to forces originating from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status. \"External\" forces encompass any influence from individuals outside Buddhism. \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Conversely, \"benign\" forces are those that neither intend to harm nor assist the Buddhist community, although their actions may inadvertently result in one or the other. These terms will recur throughout our exploration.\n\nInitially, it is crucial to examine the fundamental tenets of the religion—the doctrines that form the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.  The Dhamma essentially encompasses the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by comprehending these concepts can one attain liberation from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continues relentlessly.  Concurrently, Sansara will cease along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Monks, on the other hand, follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha, the truth that life is inherently suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico has been marked by periods of tension, particularly during the 19th century. This era, spanning roughly from 1836 to 1893, saw numerous conflicts and disputes between the two nations (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The most significant event of this period was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), which resulted in a U.S. victory and the annexation of territories including Texas and parts of the Southwest.  \n\nSuch intense rivalries between neighboring countries are not uncommon.  Shared borders often lead to competition for resources and differing perspectives on cultural and religious matters (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This dynamic is reflected in the historical relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, where clashes arose over issues such as religion, cultural traditions, and economic interests.\n\nScholar David M. Pletcher (1977) highlights the enduring nature of U.S. diplomatic challenges in Mexico and Cuba, noting that these nations stand apart from other Latin American countries in their historical relationship with the U.S. (p. 41). Pletcher's observation underscores the unique complexities in U.S.-Mexico relations, shaped by geographical proximity and a history marked by conflict.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations. As Sally Frahm (2001) points out, American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries mirrored the ideological struggles of the Cold War era, where the U.S. clashed with communism (p. 86). In this case, however, the ideological divide stemmed from religious beliefs rather than political systems. \n\nThis historical distrust between the U.S. and Mexico can be traced back to the lingering animosities between their former colonial powers, Spain and England.  This inherited animosity presented a significant obstacle to the development of amicable relations.  \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during this period of rivalry.  Most of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border incursions and frontier disputes (p. 145).  Banditry and outlaw activity crossing the border became a major concern, requiring military intervention by both nations to maintain order (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the U.S. economically (p. 109). Eventually, American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico, marking a turning point in their relationship (p. 110).",
            "A life-altering event occurred fifteen years ago, plunging me into a state of unexpected disability brought on by an illness I had never encountered before. At that time, I was a registered nurse, a profession I had chosen due to a deep-seated desire for the stability and security that had eluded me during my childhood.  The unwavering refrain I heard throughout my adolescence and beyond was, \"You'll always find work; people will always need medical care.\"  Although my true aspirations lay in the realms of science and journalism, perhaps a blend of both, I ultimately settled on nursing.\n\nHowever, fate took an unexpected turn. I found myself at the age of 46, single, with limited financial resources, and unable to work. The disability persists to this day, and after fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I am left with virtually nothing that I can truly call my own.  Each day is a struggle, a constant challenge to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty has become a defining aspect of my life; yet, there is one undeniable truth: I would not have endured these years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of cherished friends.  Let me assure you, when true adversity strikes, one's perceived strength can quickly diminish.\n\nLife is inherently unpredictable, full of both minor and major emergencies.  There are no guarantees, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges surpass our individual capacity to overcome.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that the United States should move away from excessive reliance on government programs.  Frankly, the current system is riddled with inefficiencies and is in dire need of reform. However, I believe a more pressing need is for Americans to rediscover the importance of mutual trust and support.\n\nRather than isolating ourselves and striving to secure our own individual survival, we should be fostering a culture of helping each other and extending a hand in need.  The notion of \"rugged individualism,\" often championed by conservative voices, overlooks the fundamental role compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources played in the nation's early development. The pioneers who ventured westward in wagon trains did not succeed by going it alone; their survival depended on collective effort and shared burdens.\n\nTherefore, while preparedness is essential, let us not neglect the importance of community.  Invest in a basic disaster kit: first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting and duct tape for potential emergencies, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the means, consider establishing a small farm and learning to preserve your own food, or investing in a wood stove if living in a suitable dwelling.\n\nBut most importantly, forge meaningful connections with your neighbors.",
            "The mechanisms driving evolutionary change in organisms are complex and multifaceted. While understanding these processes has long been a goal of biological study,  achieving a precise mathematical description of even the simplest organic forms remains a significant challenge. Despite this, recent advancements in mathematical modeling have allowed for explorations into the evolution of certain biological features.\n\nFor instance, mathematical models have been applied to the study of mollusk shell development, examining both ontogeny (individual development) and phylogeny (evolutionary history). Our research focuses on utilizing mathematical modeling, in conjunction with experimental investigations, to elucidate the factors influencing the direction and intensity of evolutionary-developmental changes in the gastropod genus *Prunum*.\n\nWe employed X-radiography to obtain quantitative measurements of shell morphology across various *Prunum* species.  These measurements were then incorporated into the CerioShell software program, allowing us to construct hypothetical shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of potential morphological variation within the genus.  The results of these modeling exercises will be integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary trends within this group.\n\nThe morphology of a shell can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional structure that evolves through time.  Individual spiral turns, known as whorls, encircle an imaginary central axis called the columella.  The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and the line separating each whorl is called the suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the body whorl.\n\nShells are often examined from four primary perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural.  In the \"conventional\" orientation, known as the apertural view, the aperture faces the observer and the apex points upwards.\n\nCounting whorls can be accomplished by first observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the beginning of the first suture. A line drawn through this point divides the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter whorl.\n\nViewing a shell as a series of apertures that unfold through time and space as the animal builds its shell provides a unique perspective.  The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with its horizontal and vertical radius.  This trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically.\n\nOnce a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, offering insights into the interplay between form and function in evolutionary processes.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality has plateaued over the past decade. Despite advancements in areas like water and sanitation, which align with the Millennium Development Goals, improvements in child and maternal health haven't kept pace with the targets set for 2015. This deceleration necessitates a deeper examination of the contributing factors, pointing towards the need for systemic health-sector strengthening rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has made strides in increasing births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, reaching 72%, this figure encompasses traditional providers like midwives. These individuals, while valuable, lack the medical expertise to manage complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate attributed to hemorrhage. Consequently, this indicator's improvement may be somewhat deceptive, highlighting the persistent need for further progress.\n\nFurthermore, the percentage of under-five children with diarrheal illnesses receiving professional treatment has declined. Though postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area also requires urgent attention, with low utilization rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain below expectations, hovering around 4%. This disparity is further amplified by the stark contrast between urban (7%) and rural (2%) c-section rates, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Access to quality care appears concentrated in urban centers, while rural communities face significant challenges.\n\nThe issue of vertical equity is equally concerning, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. This suggests a substantial barrier to healthcare access for the most vulnerable population, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nAddressing neonatal and maternal care improvements necessitates a fundamental question: Is it more effective to implement program-specific solutions or bolster the overall health system, encompassing pre- and postnatal care for mothers and infants? While targeted programs offer the allure of focused objectives and potentially faster results, several drawbacks warrant consideration.\n\nConcentrating resources on a specific health sector can lead to neglect in other areas, diverting funding and human resources.  The impact of HIV/AIDS funding on the family planning sector serves as a cautionary example. Additionally, parallel programs for a single area often result in duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts, leading to administrative complexities and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is often characterized by meticulous attention to detail and a prominent focus on the aristocratic class of that era. However, two notable novels, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" deviate from this established convention. Both stories incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, setting them apart from their contemporaries. This departure enriches the characters, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities. \n\nOne illustrative example can be found in this passage from \"Oliver Twist\": “And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220) \n\nThese novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and context of these moments vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these occurrences often reveal glimpses into Oliver's inner turmoil, his unspoken pain, and his growing awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. The shooting of Oliver, revisited vividly in chapter 28,  takes on a dreamlike quality as he struggles for help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events, and the dire consequences his health has suffered, highlighted by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he remains oblivious to the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away. He relives his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, experiencing a constant, fear-driven agony.  Oliver's helplessness raises questions about the source of his misfortune, as it's clearly not his own doing. This reinforces the idea that Oliver has little agency, unable to exert any control, even in the face of imminent danger. A growing sense of defeat pervades this scene, suggesting Fagin's influence has broken Oliver's spirit, forcing him to accept his despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it's reasonable to assume Oliver would have made some attempt to save himself.\n\n\nAnother example of this dreamlike state can be seen in \"Wuthering Heights\": “The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with elementary students in an after-school program. While I was capable of assisting in various subjects, my strongest areas were English and reading.  One particular student, a boy named Adrian, who I believe was in either third or fourth grade, presented a unique challenge. He struggled significantly with reading, displaying peculiar patterns. Some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him. It was quite perplexing. I knew Adrian was of Latino heritage, as he spoke perfect English.\n\nWe encountered difficulties until the day I met his mother. While the rest of the after-school group was on a field trip, Adrian's mother visited.  She didn't speak any English, only Spanish.  Fortunately, despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was then that a realization struck me: Adrian could read perfectly well, but he wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. \n\nWhile I'm unsure if this realization directly helped him, I sincerely hope he's doing better now.  \n\nSharing this story highlights the issue of the language barrier in our schools, particularly here in California. It demonstrates that challenges aren't always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can present significant obstacles.  This problem is widely recognized, but the question remains: what can we do about it?\n\nFor Adrian, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring focused on English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciation. However, the situation is far more complex for children with limited English proficiency. There isn't a single solution. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, none of these approaches alone can fully address this issue.  The key lies in a multifaceted approach, combining various methods.\n\nThe dual language system is a commendable concept, beneficial not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research indicates that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically.\n\nSome people fear that dual language programs are a waste of resources and that the majority of students won't benefit.  This is a misconception. Implementing these programs as the norm rather than the exception would benefit all children. \n\nBut how do we achieve this?  Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is unrealistic and impractical. However, I believe it's entirely feasible to have bilingual support staff, tutors, or assistants.",
            "From our earliest years, many of us are told about a presence greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp.  Some seek answers in religious institutions like Sunday schools or temples, while others look inward. Traditions often guide our beliefs, passed down through generations, but some reject them entirely, clinging to the confines of their own limited perspectives. Our values can shift and change throughout life, leading us on a personal quest to define our place in the universe. We yearn for guidance, a beacon of light to illuminate our path and lead us towards understanding.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father murmured, his gaze fixed on the rain drumming against the tin roof of our porch. We sat together, sharing a cigarette as the downpour soaked the plants lining the edge of the steps. He seemed lost in thought, his eyes reflecting a mixture of longing and memory.  His frame had become more fragile, his clothes hanging loosely on his weakened body. His hair, once thick, was now noticeably thinner. He avoided my gaze, staring out into the grayness. I felt a deep sense of isolation and fear, an inability to voice the overwhelming sadness that threatened to consume me. To speak of my impending loss would only amplify the reality, an unbearable truth for us both. I reached out, pulling him into a hug, and then settled back into my chair, drawing closer to his side. Together, we watched the rain cascade down on the twilight world.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father died. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but ultimately failed to ease his pain. He lingered beyond the doctors' predictions, trapped in a cycle of agony.  The purpose of this extended struggle remained a mystery to me. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I  whispered into the emptiness of the night, my prayers unanswered. It seemed as if any connection to a higher power had long since been severed.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final moments, the transition from life to whatever lay beyond.  Watching him fade away felt too painful, too final. I chose to remember him by the life he had lived, not by the way he died. I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be a passive observer at his deathbed. I retreated into the safety of my bed, curling into a tight ball, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nSilence. No one even bothered to call.",
            "The Gothic novel, as Ian Watt notes in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" presents a fascinating paradox: it's both \"old\" and \"new.\" This genre has been subject to a range of critical responses, from dismissal to praise, with accusations of shallowness countered by admiration for its exploration of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" often considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, ingeniously blended elements of both ancient and modern romances, forging a new literary expression. Walpole strategically employed theatrical conventions from the past, alongside a modern, more naturalistic approach, to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic architecture, theatre, and traditions, even though the term \"Gothic\" itself carried connotations of archaism and lack of sophistication in comparison to the perceived advancements of the contemporary era. The marriage of these theatrical elements with the novel's innovative format, allowing readers a more intimate understanding of characters' inner lives, contributes to the Gothic's enduring appeal. Despite its historical roots, it continues to resonate with readers across time, simultaneously feeling both outdated and refreshingly novel.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic literature is chivalry, a concept deeply rooted in the medieval period. The training and ideals of knighthood are both preserved and transformed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Gothic writers were particularly drawn to chivalry because it represented an idealized archetype: the brave, honorable, and competent knight. This ideal, they often perceived, had been lost in the complexities of contemporary society. Through the exploration of chivalric values and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the genre's future evolution into Romanticism. This nostalgic lens serves as a commentary on the present, suggesting a longing for a simpler, more virtuous age.\n\nWalpole, writing during a politically tumultuous period, was deeply concerned about the future. Facing personal challenges and accusations, he might have subconsciously yearned for the perceived moral clarity and inherent goodness of the \"Gothic past.\" This sentiment is evident in several characters, notably Frederic. Even before his introduction, Frederic is presented as embodying chivalric traits:\n\n[Insert description of Frederic here]\n\nThis description is heavy with traditional chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has suffered tragedy and is believed to have been killed by enemies, embodies the exaggerated image of the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a trope that would become quintessential to Gothic literature (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate network of activities involved in moving goods from the moment a customer places an order through the entire journey, encompassing raw materials, supply procurement, production, and finally, product delivery to the customer.  The term itself, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, encapsulates the overarching strategy of planning, implementing, and monitoring these interconnected processes to ensure customer needs are met efficiently and promptly.\n\nOliver's framework identifies six crucial elements that form the backbone of any effective supply chain: production, sourcing, inventory management, location strategy, transportation, and information flow. Business leaders leverage these elements to optimize customer service and satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial stage in this chain, lays the groundwork for the entire operation. It involves meticulously defining when, where, and how goods will be manufactured, taking into account customer demand.  Understanding market trends and analyzing consumer preferences are vital for managers to determine product specifications and production volumes.  \n\nOnce these key decisions are made, the focus shifts to selecting the optimal production location, considering factors like capacity, quality standards, and proximity to both suppliers and customers.  Efficient scheduling of work, alongside meticulous equipment maintenance, are crucial for ensuring smooth and uninterrupted production.  The production stage demands meticulous attention to detail, as any oversight can have significant financial and time-related repercussions.  Companies like Walmart and Target exemplify this by implementing detailed procedures and guidelines for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, thereby minimizing confusion and maximizing operational efficiency.\n\nThe second critical element, supply, involves strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships.  A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specialized expertise.  Managers must carefully assess which division is best suited for each stage of the production process.  Outsourcing certain tasks to external companies can also be a strategic choice. This is often done to enhance efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, allowing companies to focus on their core competencies while leveraging the specialized skills and resources of external partners.",
            "A curious scene unfolds on a bustling city street. Actress Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" stands alone, holding a cardboard sign aloft. The message, penned in bold black marker, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" This cryptic statement, while seemingly outlandish, hints at a deeper concern. \n\nBurma, officially known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation grappling with a complex political reality. Since 1962, the country has been governed by a military junta, a powerful group that seized control through a coup.  In 2007, a wave of public protests, the first in a decade, swept through the streets. These demonstrations, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" were spearheaded by Buddhist monks, their saffron robes a symbol of both their faith and their defiance. \n\nInitially, the government tolerated the peaceful gatherings, but the situation quickly escalated. What began as calls for reform transformed into a violent clash between the monks and the military. Monasteries were raided, foreign journalists were detained, and the world watched in horror as the situation spiraled out of control. The death toll, officially reported as 13, is disputed by some, with allegations of a much higher number of casualties.\n\nBurma's story is not unique. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute power. From the Roman emperors claiming divine authority to the current political landscape, the struggle between those in power and those seeking change is a recurring theme.\n\nExamples of this power struggle are etched in history. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 saw students, workers, and intellectuals calling for greater freedoms in China. The exact number of casualties remains shrouded in controversy, with official figures starkly different from independent estimates. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu extremists systematically targeted Tutsis and political moderates, serves as a chilling reminder of the brutality that can erupt when ethnic tensions are exploited for political gain. And of course, the horrors of the Holocaust, where the Nazi regime systematically persecuted and murdered millions of Jews, stands as a testament to the dangers of unchecked hatred and intolerance.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music can be largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his exceptional talent in molding his orchestra. While his piano presence might be understated in many of the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his ability to craft intricate and sophisticated pieces that allowed each band member to showcase their individual strengths.  \n\nEllington masterfully created a framework where soloists could freely improvise, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically highlighted the unique styles of his musicians, thus enriching the overall musical tapestry. This meticulous attention to detail resulted in cohesive and original soundscapes that perfectly complemented each piece. Ellington's profound understanding of each player's individual sound, as well as their collective synergy within the ever-evolving ensemble, enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and awe-inspiring compositions in jazz history. \n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative approach, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work demonstrates Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrics. Furthermore, \"Creole Love Call\" exemplifies Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his extensive discography. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition, comprising six distinct choruses, unfolds as follows:\n\n* **Chorus 1:**  A call and response exchange between the vocal and reed sections, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone, gradually transitioning to a rougher, more expressive quality towards the end.\n* **Chorus 2:** A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes, adding a layer of depth and melancholy.\n\n* **Chorus 3:** A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase, creating a sense of soaring beauty and intricate interplay. \n\n* **Chorus 4:** The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections, intensifying the musical conversation. \n* **Chorus 5:** The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by a syncopated stop time rhythm from the brass and rhythm sections, building to a powerful crescendo.\n* **Chorus 6:** A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call and response between the voice and reeds. In this iteration, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, showcasing its full instrumental potential as a solo voice. \n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, leaving a lasting impression.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice to add a unique tonal dimension to this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that consistently permeates his work.  In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly blends his skill in tight orchestration with his discerning ear for tonal color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously utilizes the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound.  \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands upon these ideas, as Ellington masterfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a prominent member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone, showcasing his ability to extract unique and unexpected sonic qualities from his musicians.",
            "Throughout her life, a persistent yearning had lingered within her. It was a craving that remained unfulfilled, a void she couldn't quite define.  This feeling first emerged when she was fourteen, on the cusp of adolescence, and continued unabated three years later at the age of seventeen. By then, she'd realized her desire wasn't for material possessions, but for companionship – a connection with another person.  However, she found herself unmoved by the attentions of boys who sought her out. They'd make clumsy attempts to win her affection, but none sparked any real interest. This perplexing lack of romantic interest led her to question herself relentlessly, trying to decipher the underlying cause of this unusual experience. Years of introspection had yielded various theories, but none felt substantial enough to warrant serious consideration. So, she carried on with her life, perpetually grappling with this enigmatic longing.\n\nHer typical days were marked by tranquility. Her parents were kind, composed individuals who rarely, if ever, clashed. Arguments with their daughter were equally infrequent. The only disagreements arose when she asserted her independence and free-spirited nature.  Though she was the daughter of a serene couple, her vibrant and engaging personality often contrasted with their calmness, making her a beloved and likable presence.\n\nToday, however, tranquility was absent. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, a piercing scream from the kitchen shattered the peace. It was her mother's voice, filled with distress. She rushed into the room, panic rising within her as she cried out, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother lay on the floor, grimacing in pain, uttering short, pained gasps.  Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a hand on her mother's arm in an attempt to offer comfort. \"Ouch...sweetheart, I...need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed, her words clipped and strained. Her daughter sensed the severity of her mother's condition. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mother gestured with her hands, and in that moment, the daughter felt immense gratitude for the strength-training classes she had taken.  She carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car, gently laying her down in the backseat, and then drove towards the hospital.\n\nThe sterile scent of disinfectant and the air thick with the aura of sickness and apprehension hung heavy in the hospital. But her daughter's focus remained solely on her mother. She swiftly wheeled her inside and called for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered around, and someone quickly retrieved a gurney and laid her mother on it.  She was whisked away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nLater, she learned that her mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach a vase from the top shelf of a cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern resembling the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a specific scoring system called the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and death from stroke. The aMed diet, a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while prioritizing monounsaturated fats over saturated fats.  Fish consumption is encouraged, and animal products and saturated fats are limited. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a link between following a Mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of overall mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these earlier studies did not specifically examine the connection between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis study followed a large group of 74,886 women, ranging in age from 38 to 63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term observational study involving 121,700 female nurses across eleven US states. These women had no history of CVD or diabetes at the start of the study.  \n\nOver a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, researchers assessed the participants' adherence to the aMed diet using detailed questionnaires about their food intake over the previous year. These questionnaires, known as \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs), underwent rigorous validation studies to ensure accuracy.\n\nInformation about CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke events was collected through medical records, hospital records, autopsies, and death certificates. When complete medical documentation was unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all stroke cases and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.  \n\nTo account for other factors that could influence the results, researchers collected data on each participant's body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of hormone therapy. Starting in 1986, information about their physical activity levels was also gathered.\n\nTo minimize the impact of random variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative average aMed scores based on the repeated FFQs, combining scores from the two preceding years. Statistical adjustments were made to control for potential \"confounding\" factors such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nA statistical technique called Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were created for fatal and nonfatal cases of both CHD and stroke.\n\nThe findings revealed a clear association: higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was linked to a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in these women.  Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest aMed quintile (meaning they adhered most closely to the diet) had a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The U.S. economy faced a severe downturn in 2007, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and widespread financial distress among major corporations. This economic instability continues to cast a long shadow, prompting us to examine its origins and potential solutions. At its core, the crisis stemmed from a combination of imprudent political decisions and flawed financial practices.  \n\nPressure from policymakers encouraged banks and financial institutions to extend subprime loans, fueling an already fragile financial infrastructure.  Government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were also incentivized to package these mortgages into complex securities known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, a ripple effect ensued, leaving banks with inadequate capital reserves and spreading the crisis throughout the financial system.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s during the Clinton administration. The President, seeking re-election, prioritized policies aimed at increasing his popularity, including relaxing lending standards. This, as noted by Steven Holmes of The New York Times in 1999, created a vulnerable environment for the housing market. Holmes observed that Fannie Mae, under pressure from both the Clinton administration and its shareholders, was aggressively expanding mortgage lending to lower and moderate-income borrowers. He prophetically warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. \n\nThe crisis was further exacerbated by the emergence of new and intricate mortgage products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs.  These complex instruments intertwined the housing market with other sectors of the economy, leading to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial institutions.  When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities faced catastrophic losses.\n\nThe crisis had a devastating impact on the financial landscape. Top U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage-related debt in 2007, representing approximately 30% of the nation's GDP.  Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at deeply discounted prices, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to stricter regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition. It's the part of the story where a writer attempts to weave intricate prose, captivating the reader's attention. Or, it can be the section where readers lose interest, their eyes glazing over as they long for the narrative to progress. Even seasoned authors like Dr. Merlin have been known to express frustration when faced with excessive exposition.\n\nThe key principle to remember is \"Show, don't tell.\"  Despite this, even experienced writers can fall into the trap of long, descriptive passages that lack action or momentum.  Exposition, in its purest form, is the act of directly conveying information to the reader, often in a straightforward manner. Think of a film scene where one character delivers a lengthy monologue, dumping a torrent of details on their counterpart.  In written fiction, this responsibility falls on the author.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine a story where the heroine's romantic history is laid out in stark detail: how she met her husband, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder.  While this information is crucial to the plot, delivering it in a two-page exposition would be jarring. Instead, the author should focus on showcasing the husband's character through his interactions and dialogue, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions.  Similarly, the heroine's personality should be illuminated through her reactions to her husband, demonstrating how his presence shaped her life.\n\nBy immersing the reader in these emotional nuances, the author can create a deeper connection to the husband's fate and, consequently, to the heroine's grief. The reader should feel the weight of his loss alongside the heroine, amplifying the emotional impact of the story.\n\nIn essence, the author must go beyond the mere outline of events and provide depth and substance to the narrative. It's tempting to rush through character development, but investing time in crafting a compelling backstory can significantly enhance the overall reading experience. For instance, a new character with a past in the Air Force, now working as a gas station night manager, might seem like a simple archetype.  However, delving into his motivations, dreams, and personal struggles can transform him into a multi-dimensional character that resonates with the reader.",
            "My television viewing this morning included two local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live broadcast from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011, led with a story about a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed. The report, which lasted approximately two minutes, indicated that the victim had sustained multiple stab wounds and that Hostettler had been apprehended. I felt the amount of time dedicated to this story was appropriate given its developing nature.\n\nThe second segment focused on a shooting that occurred earlier that morning in the Sharon Woods area, involving an 18-year-old male named Travis Buyers. Buyers sustained critical injuries, and at the time of the broadcast, no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was actively investigating the crime. I perceived this story as relatively brief, and I wondered if this brevity might be attributed to the victim's race. It's a concerning observation I've made over time: when minority individuals are victims of crime, media coverage often appears to be more limited compared to instances involving white individuals.  \n\nSubsequent segments covered a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter,  a weather forecast predicting rain and thunderstorms for the weekend, and a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The robbery story involved a description of the suspect, a black male, emphasizing his race and complexion, which I found somewhat unusual. \n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio.  The report mentioned his 300-month sentence, which I found interesting, as opposed to simply stating 25 years.",
            "The relationship between brothers is unique, characterized by an unbreakable connection that transcends the ordinary. This bond encompasses a spectrum of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers possess an innate understanding of each other, a depth of comprehension unmatched by any other relationship.  They see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes, not as others perceive them, but as their true selves. It is during moments of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond comes to light, revealing its inherent strength, for better or for worse.  The intensity of these emotions often carries significant consequences.  Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal link necessitates confronting the repercussions they bring.  When one can look into the eyes of a brother and see a mirror image of oneself, they see not a constructed facade, but an authentic reflection.  It is within their actions and the outcomes of those actions that their true character is revealed.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" delves into this theme, exploring the complex and often conflicting emotions that define the bond between brothers. Set against a backdrop of lush and vividly rendered landscapes, two brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile.  The narrative culminates in a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive the ordeal. This central theme is conveyed through a combination of direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which provides insight into the protagonist's internal world and his perception of his surroundings, both of which significantly influence his behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a singular, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful endeavor, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle.  He yearned for a brother who could share his experiences and accomplishments, a companion who could engage in activities such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\"  He envisioned a brother with whom he could share adventures, \"someone to race to Horsehead Landing...and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\"  However, Doodle's physical limitations, born from a weak heart that made survival a constant challenge, shattered these hopes. The protagonist, consumed by ambitious dreams, struggled to reconcile his aspirations with his brother's reality.\n\nHis anger towards Doodle is palpable as he recounts considering infanticide, contemplating suffocating the child. This disturbing thought reveals the depth of his frustration.  Yet, a simple smile from Doodle triggers a shift in his feelings, softening his resolve. This suggests that his initial thoughts were not firmly rooted in malice but rather a manifestation of his disillusionment.  Deep down, the protagonist possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human mind is a complex system designed for handling and generating information.  As our understanding of technology progressed from basic to advanced, the ways we've likened the brain to machines also evolved. Initially, comparisons were drawn to simple tools like wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, later shifting to more sophisticated analogies like books and, most recently, computers. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful, have their limitations and can sometimes lead to inaccurate conclusions about the brain's true nature.\n\nThe process of information management begins with input from our senses. These organs transform physical stimuli – things like touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrical and chemical signals. The brain then refines this raw data through a series of intricate algorithms, employing both bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine looking at a black square against a white background. Bottom-up processing helps us break down the image into its fundamental elements: color, shape, and edges. This allows us to recognize the distinct form of the square. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages prior knowledge and expectations to accelerate this recognition. In this case, it might help us instantly identify the object as a box rather than simply a collection of shapes.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain level, a specialized filter determines its significance and directs it to the appropriate cognitive functions. For example, while our brains constantly process visual data from our surroundings, our attention filter prevents us from consciously registering every blade of grass we see while walking. Conversely, it allows us to focus on our name even amidst a bustling crowd. This filtering process occurs at multiple stages, continually shaping the information we experience.\n\nFor the brain to function effectively, information must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods depending on the type of stimulus. For instance, spoken words can be encoded structurally (based on their appearance), phonemically (based on their sound), or semantically (based on their meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical signal circulating through a specific set of neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained through the physical structure of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. Some are based on how humans recall memories, while others draw inspiration from computer science or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as interconnected nodes, with links representing their relationships. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, *Brave New World*, the author paints a chilling portrait of a future where technology and capitalism intertwine to create a society that prioritizes manufactured happiness and societal conformity above individual expression and genuine connection. The novel explores the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its symbiotic relationship with a capitalist system that subtly manipulates and controls its citizens.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, Huxley's critique becomes even more apparent. The concept of \"homogeny,\" the suppression of individuality and diversity, and \"reification,\" the objectification of human beings as mere cogs in a machine, resonate throughout the novel. The citizens of *Brave New World* are conditioned from birth to embrace a singular ideology, their desires and aspirations carefully curated by the World Controller, who embodies the power of a dominant class.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class, or in this case, the lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.), are kept unaware of the true power dynamics at play. Their focus is diverted towards immediate gratification and consumerism, fueled by the constant bombardment of advertisements and the promise of instant pleasure. This manufactured contentment serves to pacify the masses and maintain the status quo, much like the Marxist notion of \"ideological control\" over the proletariat.\n\nThe novel further illustrates the concept of \"hegemony,\" where a dominant class maintains control over the rest of society through subtle and pervasive means. The World Controller, representing the elite Alpha and Beta castes, manipulates the system to ensure his own power and perpetuate the cycle of oppression. The lower classes, blissfully unaware of their true position within the social hierarchy, \"buy into\" the ideology that supports this structure, ultimately becoming complicit in their own subjugation.\n\nThe absence of meaningful relationships in *Brave New World* further highlights Huxley's critique of a hyper-capitalist society.  Characters lack depth and individuality, reduced to mere stereotypes that reinforce the homogenized nature of their world.  Love, genuine emotion, and authentic connection are absent, replaced by superficial interactions driven by fleeting pleasures and physical desires. The emphasis on superficiality and material possessions underscores the dehumanizing effects of a society consumed by consumerism and the pursuit of instant gratification.\n\nUltimately, *Brave New World* serves as a cautionary tale, warning us of the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its entanglement with a system that prioritizes profit over human well-being. Huxley's masterful use of satire and dystopian imagery compels us to examine the societal structures that shape our lives and to question the true cost of progress.",
            "My experience as a student at University Park spans approximately two and a half years, which translates to four and a half semesters of learning and growth. One recurring challenge for many, including myself, is navigating the sprawling campus. During my initial year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the furthest point eastward, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Journeys from my home in Stuart Hall to classes held in locations like Willard Building, closer to the campus core, often took upwards of 25 minutes on foot, particularly when inclement weather, a frequent occurrence in State College, hampered my progress.\n\nConversations with an alumnus, not significantly older than myself, revealed that the East Halls dorms were once isolated from the main university area by vast expanses of unused land. Today, that landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation. Sports fields, imposing new structures such as the recently constructed Creamery and health services buildings, and apartment complexes now occupy the space, effectively shrinking the distance between areas. As our campus continues to expand, the ease of traversing its vastness becomes increasingly problematic. \n\nWhat, then, is the most effective solution to this mobility quandary? On a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer. However, relying solely on bicycles is insufficient. Student engagement and campus design must be attuned to the needs of cyclists.\n\nRecently, I engaged in a discussion with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a multi-year hiatus. He expressed surprise at his own enjoyment, stating that, \"Bikes are fantastic; for a period, cycling wasn't considered trendy, but it's truly the most efficient mode of transportation.\"  Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling offers unparalleled efficiency in travel. A modest breakfast of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel one over 30 miles.  Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, a distance from the campus center comparable to some dormitories.  The most astute decision I made this year was acquiring a bicycle.  Daily commutes to Thomas Building, a location at least 25 minutes away on foot from my residence, have been significantly reduced to a mere 5 minutes when I apply sufficient pedal power.\n\nHowever, Pollock Road, the most direct route from my home to Thomas Building, presents challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists. While walking has its merits, my busy schedule leaves little room for extended walks. In the absence of my bicycle, walking would be my only reliable means of reaching my classes.  The daily trek to Thomas Building alone would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, translating to over two and a half hours each week.  Adding to this the time required for traveling to and from other classes, appointments, and various obligations, the cumulative time commitment would be unsustainable."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",

While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My aspirations lie in the field of social work, specifically within the Division of Family and Children Services. I'm drawn to the opportunity to work directly with children who have experienced abuse or neglect, offering them support and guidance.  I believe my values align strongly with the core principles of social work: service, respect, ethical conduct, and a dedication to fostering healthier relationships.  These values are not merely professional ideals for me; they are deeply ingrained in my personal beliefs.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force, though my chosen path remained unclear for some time. Witnessing individuals grappling with personal challenges, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, fueled my desire to make a positive impact. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009.  While I continued to explore different career options after graduation, a pivotal encounter solidified my commitment to social work.\n\nDuring a summer visit with a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. His story deeply impacted me, prompting me to offer support.  I contacted the authorities and, despite their limited legal options,  I spoke with the boy's parents, expressing my concerns. Their evasive responses and attempts to dismiss the situation as \"simple\" solidified my resolve to pursue a career advocating for children in vulnerable situations. This experience highlighted the crucial role social workers play in protecting and supporting those facing familial challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply with me.  As a society, we often champion the importance of individual uniqueness while simultaneously conforming to societal norms. This paradox is something I've actively challenged throughout my life.  From expressing my individuality through unconventional fashion choices and advocating for marginalized communities to actively participating in protests against racism and discrimination, I've consistently strived to promote equality and social change.\n\nMy commitment to social justice is unwavering, and I believe it will guide my work as a social worker, empowering me to advocate for the rights and well-being of all individuals.",
            "This paper explores the biological and sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The biological lens centers on genetic predispositions and medical factors influencing sleep. Conversely, the sociocultural approach examines environmental influences, considering the impact of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into both models, analyzing relevant research to illuminate their complexities.  Each study's findings are critically evaluated, highlighting their strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary to mental disorders, or secondary to other medical conditions. Primary sleep disorders encompass dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias. These conditions primarily affect the initiation and maintenance of sleep.  Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve behavioral or physiological disturbances during sleep, such as nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and unspecified parasomnias. Sleep disorders secondary to mental disorders are linked to either Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review focuses primarily on insomnia, but will also briefly discuss primary sleep disorders in the context of both biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genes, inherited factors, and physiological mechanisms. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness.  One study investigated mice and discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically implicated in sleep-wake states. Activating these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep.  The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that findings from animal models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Disruptions or absence of this receptor could potentially impair sleep without medication.  From a sociocultural perspective, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep patterns. Alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting various aspects of life such as education, career, and daily tasks requiring focus and concentration.",
            "This exploration delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a concise explanation of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is elucidated, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes with strategies that educators in inclusive classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes the effectiveness and efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Defined narrowly, CAPD focuses on the perceptual processing of auditory input within the CNS, encompassing the neurobiologic activity underlying this processing and generating electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it signifies a condition where the central nervous system, specifically the brain, struggles to process auditory information effectively. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity; they are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" Instead, the brain region responsible for translating sound, distinguishing words, and separating speech from background noise may not function optimally.\n\nThe earliest documented reference to this disorder, which later evolved into CAPD, dates back to the mid-1950s, termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were examining children with communicative disorders at the time. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of tests for these children in 1954.  In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in diverse ways. Individuals with CAPD may have difficulty localizing or perceiving sound in spatial contexts. They might struggle to differentiate between two or more distinct sound occurrences. Recognizing sound patterns or discerning changes in speech, such as sarcasm conveyed through variations in tone, could also pose a challenge. One sound might be masked by a subsequent sound, hindering their ability to process it.  Furthermore, they may struggle to synthesize auditory cues, interpreting them meaningfully to guide their actions.  Finally, determining the sequence of auditory information may be a challenge for individuals with CAPD.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes systematic observation of listening behaviors and/or performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. These professionals utilize a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills.  Evaluations may encompass questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including the individual's responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate. Moreover, the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, like a series of words or numbers. More sophisticated tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a potent tool for deception, its prolonged use can lead to a loss of self.  The act of revealing one's true identity, however, often carries the risk of social alienation. Ultimately, individuals must grapple with a difficult choice: prioritize their own authenticity or preserve their relationships, even if it means facing potential hurt or rejection from those around them. The play acknowledges that reactions to exposure can vary; some may remain unaffected, while others may be deeply offended by the deception.\n\nThe play's exploration of gender disguise adds another layer of complexity. It raises questions about the reasons behind individuals assuming identities that contradict their biological sex. In Viola's case, her decision to present herself as a man, Cesario, stems from a need for self-preservation in a foreign and potentially hostile environment.  As she states, she relied on the \"gentle help\" of her female attire to protect herself. (5.1.247-249) While this strategy proves effective, it also isolates her from female companionship, severing her from a vital support system.\n\nThe effectiveness of Viola's disguise becomes even more pronounced when Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, falls in love with her.  (\"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" 5.1.138)  This situation adds another layer of complexity to Viola's predicament, as she simultaneously navigates her own suppressed feelings for Orsino, who expresses his affection for her in her male guise. (\"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" 5.1. 260-261)\n\nDespite its potential to seem progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on the unveiling of suppressed emotions through deception.  The characters of Olivia and Orsino seem to grapple with unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's presence as Cesario.  It raises questions about the nature of Olivia's attraction to Cesario: is it based solely on his perceived masculinity, or does it hint at deeper, perhaps subconscious, feelings for women? While some might argue that Olivia's character is a satire of those who judge solely on appearances, her swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian, coupled with her acceptance of Viola as a sister rather than a love interest (\"A sister, you are she.\" 5.1.315), complicates this interpretation.",
            "The impact of German colonialism has been widely acknowledged for its harsh realities, particularly regarding the tragic events that befell the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa.  However, it's crucial to remember that such a vast colonial endeavor as Germany's cannot be solely defined by a single narrative.  The German empire exhibited a wide range of governing approaches and policies across its diverse territories, mirroring the geographical variations it encompassed.  \n\nSimilarly, educational initiatives implemented within these colonies displayed a spectrum of approaches. When British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German educational efforts. Contemporary writers also commended German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies.  \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a starkly different picture.  Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established public schools and played a central role in educating the native population, South West Africa saw the responsibility of native education largely delegated to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  Despite this, the German government did invest considerable resources in the education of European residents within the colony, developing a system of public schools and providing substantial backing and oversight for missionary schools. The lasting consequences of these educational policies in South West Africa were profound, extending even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies witnessed significant literacy and educational attainment among Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, with the majority of its population lacking education and literacy. \n\nThis discrepancy in educational outcomes can be attributed to a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in greater depth.  A particular focus will be placed on newly available research that sheds light on the attitudes and perspectives of both colonial authorities and settlers towards the native African population.\n\n\nA wealth of academic material addresses the topic of education within the German colonial empire.  A significant proportion of these sources are in German and originate from the early twentieth century, encompassing the period of direct German colonial rule.  The initial emphasis of these works was primarily descriptive, outlining the key features of educational systems across the colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of the educational landscape.  These studies consistently highlighted the significant variations in educational approaches across different colonies. \n\nCohen's study, which specifically focuses on education in both South West Africa and East Africa, stands out as a particularly relevant work for this paper. Cohen meticulously compares the educational systems of these two colonies, investigating the underlying factors responsible for their distinct characteristics.  Cohen posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a primary driver behind many of the unique features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonial holdings, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although a significant portion of the territory is characterized by arid desert. This relatively favorable environment attracted a larger European population to South West Africa.  By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, a figure significantly higher than the 5,336 Europeans living in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The realm of popular music has witnessed a remarkable expansion in its classification over the past century, encompassing a vast array of genres that are nearly impossible to enumerate exhaustively.  Adding to this complexity, most, if not all, established genres, including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into multiple subgenres and sub-subgenres. Over the last 40 years, the subgenre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive forms within popular music. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though these often lean towards the darker end of the emotional scale.  \n\nHeavy Metal's diversity is equally notable, as its inception sparked a wave of experimentation and innovation. Artists quickly recognized the genre's inherent flexibility and began crafting their own unique subgenres, which in turn gave rise to further subdivisions, creating a branching network of styles that continues to evolve today.\n\nWe now find ourselves at a juncture where the heavy metal movement encompasses a plethora of distinct niches, making it challenging to precisely define its boundaries. While it has absorbed influences from various other genres, its origins remain firmly rooted in a specific cultural context. To truly comprehend the diverse landscape of heavy metal music prevalent today, one must first delve into the nature of the movement itself, understanding why it transcends the confines of a mere genre label.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement characterized by a distinct aesthetic of darkness. It can be perceived as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. It embraces technical proficiency, moving away from primitivism and highlighting the virtuosity of the musicians. It is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement profoundly influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s fueled a wave of creative exploration, resulting in music that pushed the boundaries of convention and experimentation.\n\nThis dark, visceral quality was a departure from the prevailing trends in popular music, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of human emotion.  Subsequent generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's exploration of darkness and emotional intensity. Lyrics often reflect this thematic preoccupation:\n\n(Byrne)\n\n\n These lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles exemplify the darker side of their musical output, capturing a sense of emotional turbulence that some interpret as a reflection of drug-induced experiences. This song is considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of Heavy Metal, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, more intense music. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their own capacity for sonic aggression, incorporating this darker element into \"The White Album.\"",
            "Long before the Surrealist movement captivated the art world with its dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist artist, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a masterpiece from 1910, embodies not just a woman in awe of a fantastical landscape, but also Rousseau's personal aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and validation from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. This desire, however, presented him with a profound internal conflict.  The painting serves as a poignant reflection of Rousseau's lifelong struggle: should he conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain approval from the esteemed art world he deeply admired, or should he embrace his unique creative vision and forge his own path?\n\nTo fully grasp the layers of meaning within \"The Dream,\" it's essential to understand Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in the French town of Laval in 1844, Rousseau's upbringing was far removed from the world of art. His father, a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer, offered no formal art education. Instead, Rousseau dedicated his early years to working for the French government as a toll collector, although he was mistakenly labeled a customs inspector. The tragic loss of his wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only his daughter, Julia, and an overwhelming sense of grief.  In painting, he sought solace, a fresh start, and an escape from his profound sorrow. Compared to his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau's work resonated with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for acceptance within the art world can be attributed to several factors.  Unburdened by formal art training and embarking on his artistic journey later in life, he found himself competing with a generation of talented and already established modern artists.  Despite years of dedicated work, recognition eluded him until roughly the same time that Matisse began to rise to prominence. As art historian Jan Gordon notes in \"Modern French Painters,\" while Matisse and Rousseau were stylistic rivals, their motivations for painting differed significantly.  \"Matisse feared painting in a trite manner, while Rousseau's ambition was to create a conventional picture that would secure him a place within the prestigious Artiste Français,\" (92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental link between truth and beauty. This belief stems from an intuitive understanding that resonates with our experiences. As John Keats aptly stated in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" \n\nWhile we acquire much of our knowledge through formal education or direct experiences, our appreciation for both ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional learning pathways.  Both disciplines, in essence, strive to illuminate rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty predominantly aim to decipher the reasons behind a work of art's allure or an action's ethical merit, rather than establish rigid rules for artistic creation or moral conduct. \n\nFurthermore, the critique of art or morality often falls short of fully capturing the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty.  Discussions surrounding the significance of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa,\" for instance, might delve into elements like composition, lighting, or historical context, yet these factors ultimately fail to encapsulate its artistic value.  When asked about a cherished artwork or literary piece, individuals frequently express a sentiment akin to, \"There's just something about it\" before elaborating further.  \n\nI contend that both art and ethics possess an inherent quality that transcends mere description.  Flannery O'Connor aptly remarked that \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how comprehensively we analyze the features of a literary work, a certain ineffable element remains.  \n\nI propose that ethics shares this characteristic.  Wittgenstein's assertion that \"Ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental\" supports this notion. It is this elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that constitutes the most compelling attribute of art and morality, and this transcendental nature serves as a bridge between the two.\n\nI believe the profound connection between morality and art stems from our profound, often inexpressible, engagement with them. They touch us at a level that transcends rational explanation, a notion aligned with Kant's concept of the noumenal. This link is particularly potent in the realm of literature. As McKean aptly notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its distinct culture woven into the very fabric of its landscape. From the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the coastal city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea, a shared identity resonates.  This cultural tapestry is further enriched as one travels along the Rhine River, passing through Cologne and reaching the historic city of Dresden nestled on the Elbe River in Saxony. This unique cultural blend is a testament to Germany's complex origins, stemming from a multitude of ancient tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people, Germania, carries a name shrouded in historical debate. Scholars and historians alike grapple with its true etymology.  Tacitus, a Roman historian, attributed the name to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe who, according to his writings, bore the name \"Germans\" prior to their crossing of the Rhine and subsequent conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine from the subjugated Gauls.  He adopted the word from the Gauls themselves, highlighting the distinction between the two groups (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Some theorize that \"Germanus\" originated from a Gaulish word denoting a neighbor, while others suggest it derives from a spear known as a \"ger\" used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010).  Another possibility is that it stems from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying a perception of the Germans as loud and boisterous (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his influential AD 98 work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germanic people, stating that \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania remained complex. While the Romans engaged in trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely refrained from extensive colonization.  Instead, the Germanic tribes flourished on the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and utilizing their skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "My gaze fell downward, my mind processing the scene before me with a detached clarity. Thoughts flitted in and out, a rapid stream of consciousness that felt more like observation than genuine reflection. It was as though I were observing my own mind working, dissecting the image without truly engaging with it.  \n\nOnce, influenced by an artist I collaborated with, I acquired a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" A lifelong desire to draw had led me to its pages, eager to unravel the mysteries of pencil strokes and the brain's interpretation of lines.  The book encouraged a technique where an artist frames a picture with an imaginary square, simplifying complex compositions. Transforming a bustling kitchen scene, for example, into a singular focus on a bowl of fruit.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't conjure that artist's frame. I was overwhelmed, captivated, unable to do anything but simply look. Picasso had his blue period, Monet, his love for greens, and the Renaissance masters, their vibrant palettes. If I dared to dream of an artistic identity, this felt like the genesis of my work, the start of my own narrative, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers touched the chosen tool of my craft, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my thoughts taking form.  It could have been a moment of pure creation. Water swirled, smooth and clear, a serene dance of movement.  Particles detached, carried away to nothingness.  With increasing tension, my hand jerked, a spasm of anxiety, slamming the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown object refused to budge, clinging stubbornly to the bottom.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet planted, my green tie a constricting band around my neck, I frowned at the offensive package left as a message for the unfortunate souls tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid bathrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and my hand reached for the wall, gripping the roll of toilet paper. I began wrapping myself in it, mimicking an oven mitt.  Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped into the bowl, like a mother entering an oven to retrieve a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming rate of fatalities involving young drivers demands our attention.  A confluence of factors contributes to this grim reality, posing a significant challenge to the safety of our youngest motorists. Research conducted by the National Institutes of Health highlights a crucial aspect of the problem: the adolescent brain is not yet fully developed to handle the complexities and dangers inherent in driving.  In addition to this neurological immaturity, inexperience plays a pivotal role.  \n\nThis lack of experience not only elevates the risk of fatal accidents but also increases the likelihood of rollovers, speeding incidents, and driving off the road.  Furthermore, studies, such as those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, have demonstrated a clear correlation between the presence of teen passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.  \n\nWhile some states have implemented measures like provisional licenses, which restrict driving hours and passenger limitations for young drivers, these are, in my view, merely temporary solutions.  The core issue lies in the inherent limitations of adolescent drivers, as evidenced by statistical data.  \n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman, a prominent psychologist, argues that even the age of 18 is too young to grant full driving privileges.  His research, as reported by USA Today, suggests a common inclination among individuals under the age of 20 to engage in risky behavior for the sheer thrill of it.  Therefore, delaying the onset of driving until this inherent risk-taking tendency diminishes seems prudent.  \n\nContinued issuance of driver's licenses to young teenagers will inevitably result in a tragic escalation of accidents and fatalities. This concern is amplified by the impending influx of new teen drivers as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.  By 2010, millions of these new drivers will be eager to take to the road.\n\nAddressing this urgent issue requires comprehensive legislative action.  Driver's education, a cornerstone of responsible driving, can continue to be provided in schools, but the minimum age for obtaining a driver's license should be raised to 18.  Provisional permits could still be issued, leading to full licensure after a certain number of supervised driving hours, similar to the existing regulations in many states, such as California's requirement of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nThe implementation of uniform, nationwide legislation would effectively address this issue, safeguarding the well-being of young drivers across the nation. The proposed legislation is not without precedent, as similar measures have been explored and debated in various forums.",
            "My exploration of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films led me to examine a fascinating group of fifteen \"trick films\" produced between 1895 and 1901. These films, characterized by their reliance on creative editing techniques, aimed to create captivating visual illusions. My analysis focused primarily on identifying the common stylistic elements present in the majority of these trick films, while also highlighting the unique characteristics exhibited by a select few produced later in the period.\n\nA prevailing trend in trick films of this era was their confined setting within a frontal proscenium. These films typically displayed no camera movement, opting instead for long and medium shots that adhered to a strict one-shot-equals-one-film principle. However, it's worth noting that some films from the early twentieth century dared to deviate from these conventions, incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most distinctive features shared by these trick films is their utilization of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary within this proscenium, refraining from following characters or objects as they moved. This compositional style, common in early cinema, drew inspiration from the theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts.  A limitation inherent in this stage-bound approach is that the characters in trick films generally move only side to side, without progressing towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even as they exit the frame, the camera does not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also contributed to the prevalence of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-up shots were absent from all the trick films examined in the Edison catalog. This mirrored the theatrical and vaudeville tradition, where the audience viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage boundaries. As actors in these early films typically remained in the middle ground and did not approach the camera, close-up shots were rarely used.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films adhered to the principle that one conceptual shot equaled one film. This convention limited the length of most trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second employed. It also constrained the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which primarily focused on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and quick exchanges with minimal storyline.\n\nIt's important to note that a \"shot\" in a trick film, from the viewer's perspective, does not always equate to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might actually consist of several segments joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For instance, a closer examination of \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals the point where the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single shot to the viewer.",
            "A prominent figure in the early Republican movement, John Taylor of Caroline, was deeply passionate about the ideals of self-governance and individual liberty. His background in agriculture, coupled with his brief foray into politics, shaped his persona as a man known for his staunch convictions and outspoken advocacy for personal freedoms and limited government intervention. Taylor's agrarian worldview served as the foundation for his political philosophy, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.  He believed that the nascent United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an exemplary system of government, free from the constraints of pre-existing traditions.  This absence of historical precedent, he argued, allowed for the creation of a truly self-governing nation.  Taylor was a fervent believer in the inherent rights of individuals, emphasizing their interdependence –  a notion that if one right was compromised, the entire fabric of liberty would weaken.  He argued that these fundamental rights should be protected from governmental encroachment.  \n\nTaylor viewed the so-called \"state of nature\" as a scenario where those with physical strength and cunning exploited the vulnerable.  He maintained that civilization, however, should strive to transcend this natural order, ensuring fairness and equity for all.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledged the duality of human nature – both its inherent goodness and its potential for evil. He held firm to a strict dualistic moral framework, asserting that government, being an extension of humanity, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices.  Taylor defined virtuous principles as those that safeguarded private property, fostered agricultural development, and tempered the excesses of capitalism. He believed that a government grounded in such principles could function effectively regardless of the individuals who held power, which he believed would always be susceptible to avarice and self-interest.   \n\nWhile acknowledging that self-interest was a fundamental human drive, Taylor viewed it as a problematic force when it transcended the common good and led to the creation of sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others.  He argued that a well-constructed government was essential to contain these negative tendencies and, even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the erosion of its principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor championed a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly delineated within its text.  He feared that an expansive federal government would be both financially burdensome and prone to tyranny.  However, Taylor cautioned against a purely literal interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it risked obscuring the intent of its framers and paving the way for corruption.  He further asserted that the Declaration of Independence served as the true founding document of the United States, as it more explicitly articulated the nation as a federation of sovereign states rather than a single, unified entity.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This downturn was somewhat concerning, and the precise cause remains unclear. Several factors could have contributed to this trend. \n\nThe onset of winter at a New England university likely impacted commuting patterns, as bicycle and pedestrian traffic naturally decreases during colder months. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a time of intense academic focus and final preparations. Amidst this flurry of activity, maintaining consistent participation in the commuter log initiative may have been challenging.  Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which campus presence is significantly reduced. This extended absence could explain the low log submissions in January as well. However, the continued low engagement in February suggests additional factors at play.\n\nIt's possible that the initial enthusiasm surrounding the project naturally waned over time, a common phenomenon in any new initiative. To counteract this potential decline, we implemented the \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, a concentrated effort to revitalize participation. This campaign successfully resulted in a noticeable increase in log submissions. \n\nTherefore, a key challenge we encountered was sustaining project momentum, addressing both the inherent ebb and flow of engagement and the unique disruptions caused by academic breaks and holidays inherent to higher education.\n\nAnother challenge, common to any alternative commuting project, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use.  To encourage participation, we offered a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses, aiming to provide tangible incentives for adopting alternative transportation. While these incentives proved effective, it's interesting to speculate on the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or even electric cars. These more substantial rewards could have potentially mitigated the decline in engagement. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, a dynamic approach, gradually increasing the value of prizes over time, might have yielded more sustained interest.",
            "Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, much like index funds. However, ETFs offer enhanced flexibility, trading on stock exchanges just like individual stocks.  This allows investors to benefit from the diversification of index funds while enjoying the advantages associated with stock ownership, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractional shares.  Despite these appealing attributes, it's important to note that ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.  A potential drawback is the presence of trading commissions on ETF transactions, similar to stock purchases.\n\nOne of the notable strengths of ETFs lies in their broad selection.  While the stated benefits are readily apparent, discerning investors should always critically assess whether these benefits, particularly diversification, are truly realized and to what extent. This analysis will focus on the ETF IHF, comparing its performance to the top ten holdings that constitute its portfolio.  The aim is to determine if the purported advantages of owning a single ETF compare favorably to those of owning a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks. Additionally, we'll explore alternative stock configurations that could potentially yield a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\nFor the sake of manageability, we'll concentrate on the top ten holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  A breakdown of these holdings and their respective asset percentages is provided below.\n\nTo gauge the extent to which these ten stocks represent the overall performance of the IHF ETF, we can utilize the current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their individual contributions to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return.  This hypothetical portfolio would be composed entirely of these ten stocks, held in the proportions reflected in the ETF's holdings. The calculated beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Furthermore, the beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole.  Based on these preliminary results, a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings appears to offer the potential for higher returns coupled with a reduced beta. However, it's essential to consider the possibility that the observed differences between these two portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo ascertain whether these portfolios exhibit statistically significant differences, we will determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks. These standard deviations will be normalized to 100% for comparative purposes, allowing us to assess their cumulative standard deviation relative to that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" among his more accomplished poetic works. Within the poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" on two occasions, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by Poe scholar, Mabbott. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, believed by the ancient Greeks to mark the edge of the known world. While Virgil's usage is documented, it's worth noting that Poe's familiarity with the term might have stemmed from contemporary German literature. \n\nPoe was deeply interested in German authors, and this influence is evident in his work.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's poem and the works of German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, suggesting that Poe might have been inspired by Goethe's writings.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a renowned figure in literary circles, particularly for his two-part poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in 1808 and 1832, the latter coinciding with Goethe's death.  Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This narrative centers on a king who, after his wife's death following a gift of a goblet, descends into despair through heavy drinking and mourning.  Driven by grief, he relinquishes his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, before ultimately choosing to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean and leaping from a cliff. The emotional state and demeanor of the King of Thulé resonate with the speaker's portrayal in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" potentially mirroring Poe's own personal struggles and coping mechanisms.  Furthermore, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a production occurring just a year before Poe used the term \"Thulé\" in his own work, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's engagement with the concept of \"Thulé\" is notable. While he uses \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the term twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem's beginning and end.  Both \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces, sharing thematic and emotional parallels. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape in Thulé, characterized by darkness, solitude, haunting memories, and a world devoid of color, mirroring the emotional desolation of the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem, who has lost his wife, his will to rule, and his desire to live.  \n\nGiven his admiration for Tennyson, it is highly probable that Poe would have been acquainted with Goethe's work, which was experiencing a surge in popularity after its initial publication.",
            "The potential for punitive damages in a case involving a customer's injury from a slip and fall due to an applesauce spill in a California grocery store presents a compelling legal question.  \n\nA judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss a claim for punitive damages brought by Jennifer Palmer.\n\nTo successfully argue for punitive damages, Palmer must demonstrate that the store manager, Martin, acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm his actions could cause. Evidence suggesting Martin's awareness of prior slip-and-fall incidents at the store, coupled with his inaction despite being informed of the spill twice, could support this claim.  While the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less straightforward, it remains plausible given the history of similar incidents and his failure to prioritize customer safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin to an applesauce spill. Martin, however,  claimed he was on his dinner break and declined to address the issue.  Tragically, just fifteen minutes later, Palmer slipped and sustained a serious back injury.  Prior to this incident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store that year. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages against D&D Markets for her injuries.\n\nCalifornia law allows for punitive damages in cases where a defendant's conduct demonstrates \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" and is not related to a contractual obligation.  \"Malice\" in this context refers to conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and carried out with a conscious disregard for the safety and rights of others.  Courts have recognized \"malicious\" conduct as encompassing situations where a defendant is aware of potential dangers resulting from their actions and intentionally chooses to ignore them.",
            "During my studies at CBC, I encountered a course on Islam that sparked considerable debate within the class. One central question that emerged, and one that feels even more pertinent today, was the nature of Islam as a religion – specifically, whether it inherently promotes hostility.  \n\nObserving the media landscape since 9/11, I've witnessed a dramatic shift in portrayal. Initially, Islam and its adherents, particularly extremists, were often presented negatively. Now, however, there seems to be a pendulum swing towards an almost excessive tolerance, a trend that feels somewhat unprecedented.  \n\nConsider the fact that in 2001, a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, whose family history demonstrably includes Muslim roots, would have likely faced significant public scrutiny. This suggests a noticeable evolution in societal perceptions.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad deeply intrigued me, presenting a seemingly paradoxical picture. Based on my prior understanding of his historical context, I had formed an image of Muhammad as a forceful leader who, through conquest, imposed Islam upon conquered tribes. However, the biography paints a different portrait – that of a misunderstood martyr, even one who humbled himself before others. It suggests a gradual awakening, where individuals, drawn to his teachings, sought him out, recognizing the \"truth\" he embodied.\n\nThere are intriguing parallels between Muhammad's ministry and the narratives surrounding Jesus's miracles. One striking example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk, providing sustenance for a large group of forty men. This stylistic choice, I believe, aims to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who didn't seek to prove himself but lived authentically, guided by miracles. I find this approach problematic, as it arguably diminishes the unique significance of Jesus's miracles. It feels as if an attempt is being made to subtly equate the two figures, potentially even appropriating aspects of Jesus's life and persona for Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography frequently employs anecdotal accounts, often relayed through multiple intermediaries. While these stories are intended to offer evidence of individuals' independent conversions to Islam, the reliance on secondhand information weakens their credibility. This layering of sources raises doubts and detracts from the stories' impact.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure – humble, wise, gentle, and endearing. This portrayal contrasts starkly with historical accounts that challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble individual. I can't help but wonder if Muslims today, privy to a more nuanced understanding of Muhammad's rise to power, might hold differing views.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought following Jesus's life presents a fascinating trajectory.  While his original teachings served as a foundation, subsequent developments within the faith have undeniably diverged from its earliest expressions.  Observing this historical progression, one discerns a noticeable shift towards greater intellectual and societal liberalization.  Despite the inherent resistance to change often displayed by traditionalists, their influence may prove insufficient to halt this broader trend.\n\nThe future holds the promise of a burgeoning awareness within the Christian community, a growing desire to differentiate between doctrines that have emerged over time and the core tenets espoused by Jesus himself.  This yearning for historical clarity, though perhaps spanning decades or even centuries, is likely to yield an inevitable outcome: a significant reversal in the course of Christian history.  \n\nImagine a movement gaining momentum, systematically dismantling layers of accumulated doctrine, akin to rewinding a clock, until only the essence of Jesus's original message, unadulterated by later interpretations, remains.  As this tide sweeps across nations like the United States and Europe, inspiring widespread adherence to Jesus's teachings, the institutional Church will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in guiding this transformation.  However, this theological regression will paradoxically usher in a period of increased uniformity within Christendom.  \n\nThe vast diversity that currently characterizes the Christian landscape will gradually give way to greater homogeneity of belief and practice.  Regional, denominational, and sectarian distinctions will fade, replaced by a renewed emphasis on shared core values.  \n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals.  The Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually embraced Christianity as its state religion.  Within our own nation, the trajectory from African-American slavery to African-American leadership exemplifies this phenomenon.  The impending reversion within the Christian faith will similarly unfold, retracing its steps to the source, while simultaneously diminishing its present-day diversity.\n\nA crucial factor in this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus's words as metaphorical, rather than literal pronouncements.  This shift in perspective will pave the way for a deeper understanding of his message and its enduring relevance.\n\nTracing the origins of Christianity, we encounter Judaism, the faith that served as its theological progenitor.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established itself as a monotheistic religion, with divinely revealed scriptures and a strong sense of authority.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" delves into the darker facets of human nature, suggesting that beneath the surface, individuals are driven by a powerful, often selfish, desire for personal gain. The characters inhabiting Sinclair's world demonstrate a stark prioritization of self-interest, often at the expense of those less fortunate.\n\nThis is most prominently illustrated in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their ambition knows no bounds, relentlessly pursuing expansion and profit, unconcerned with the human cost of their endeavors. Sinclair's vivid imagery, like the \"line of buildings standing clear-cut and black against the sky,\" juxtaposes the stark industrial landscape with the relentless pursuit of economic progress. The accompanying \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\" serves as a potent symbol of the environmental and societal consequences ignored in the pursuit of wealth.\n\nThe callous disregard for worker well-being is equally apparent.  The factory environment is characterized by \"jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  Employees are subjected to grueling hours and the constant threat of arbitrary layoffs, with no safety net or recourse.  The absence of worker protections during this era allowed factory owners to operate with impunity, exploiting their workforce and creating a system where survival itself was precarious.  \n\nEven the attempts at collective action, through unions, were often compromised, further highlighting the power imbalance and leaving workers trapped in a cycle of exploitation. The stark comparison to chattel slavery underscores the dehumanizing conditions endured by those who lived and worked in Packingtown, their lives consumed by the relentless demands of the industrial system.",
            "Numerous authors employ diverse strategies to evoke specific sentiments or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of these methods in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\"  He frequently juxtaposes adjectives and nouns that don't conventionally align, thereby imbuing subjects with a particular aura. Additionally, he ascribes meaning to symbols and subsequently leverages them for a similar purpose. Fitzgerald prominently employs this latter technique with various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.  Within \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald meticulously constructs symbolic meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to evoke specific feelings associated with pivotal objects.\n\nThe connotation Fitzgerald cultivates and employs for white/gray is that of homogeneity, with white representing a refined and elevated status, while gray signifies an older, more faded aspect. He establishes this association early in the novel through consistent depictions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone seems perpetually clad in white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instance where individuals deviate from white attire occurs during Nick's perception of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further refines the significance of these two colors by associating them with commonplace, unassuming subjects. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's party guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. Catherine's apartment is characterized as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). He also portrays ordinary people or locations using white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19). The valley of ashes boasts \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23). The \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing sufficient meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald utilizes them to signify insignificance or uniformity in relation to certain subjects. This application of color symbolism to reveal underlying meanings commences with Daisy. Following a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald portrays Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to perceive Daisy less as a multifaceted character and more as a uniform element, a mere object of Gatsby's desire (74). Fitzgerald amplifies this impression of Daisy's uniformity through further instances, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County enjoys a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant, sunny climate.  Popular crops grown in the region include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.  There's a significant demand for organic, community-supported agriculture products in the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand.  Many organic farms offer tours, allowing visitors to learn about agricultural practices while enjoying recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. \n\nThis type of operation presents an opportunity for landowners to leverage government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat quality, thereby creating avenues for farm tours, educational programs, and additional income streams.\n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming practices often lead to increased biodiversity in both plants and wildlife. This is attributed to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more expensive than conventional methods in certain aspects.  It requires more hands-on labor and management to control pests, weeds, and fertilize the soil naturally.  Losses are often higher compared to conventional methods, and smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale found in larger operations.\n\nPractices that benefit wildlife, even if not directly related to organic farming, can also increase labor costs.  These practices include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotation, managing invasive species, and actively cultivating plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edges or open areas. \n\nTherefore, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance in maximizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land, a 160-acre parcel adjacent to Potrero, California, encompasses chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, it falls under the purview of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Currently under review, this plan identifies over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened. These include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. \n\nThis area holds historical significance, having been inhabited by Native Americans for generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. This particular land parcel, originating from an early homestead patent, likely served as grazing land and/or a source of wood for many years.\n\nTo illustrate potential pathways for a small farmer, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to determine feasible options for cost mitigation and wildlife conservation.  As a practical example, I identified an existing organic farm in the same region to demonstrate achievable goals.",
            "Cultural nuances significantly impact any negotiation process. Culture, more than a fixed entity, is a dynamic interplay of shared values, beliefs, and practices. It's crucial to recognize that generalizations about entire cultures, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are overly simplistic and potentially misleading. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a successful negotiator delves deeper, understanding the specific cultural context of the situation and how it might influence interactions at the negotiating table. \n\nWhen encountering a new culture, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own cultural background. However,  attempting to truly grasp another culture involves a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical understanding, awareness of potential biases, and a willingness to accept cultural differences without judgment. Rather than trying to change or impose one's own cultural norms, it's essential to work within the boundaries of the other culture, especially when in a weaker negotiating position.  Respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territories can be instrumental in overcoming cultural barriers and fostering productive dialogue.\n\nIt's important to remember that cultural influences extend beyond national borders.  Within a single nation, diverse corporate cultures can emerge, shaping work environments and interactions.  These differences manifest in various ways, including dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), delegation practices, and even employee engagement in philanthropic activities.  Examining the spectrum of American corporate cultures, from region to region and urban to suburban settings, highlights the richness and complexity of cultural influences within a single society.  While some cultures might appear more homogenous on the surface, a deeper exploration often reveals a surprising degree of internal diversity.\n\nValues serve as the foundation of a culture, providing the underlying \"why\" behind its practices. Understanding these core values is crucial for successful negotiation. For example, cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony might discourage public criticism or confrontation, even in negotiations. Conversely, cultures that value assertive bargaining might prioritize securing the best possible deal, potentially delaying a settlement.  \n\nWhile recognizing these cultural tendencies is essential, a negotiator should also strive to understand their counterpart on a personal level to build rapport and enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’”  found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This belief, which we will explore in relation to another prominent theologian, Thomas Aquinas, posits the existence of a specific God – the God of the Bible.  To ensure a meaningful comparison of their arguments, we will proceed under the assumption that both Anselm and Aquinas hold this conviction. \n\nAnselm's approach to understanding God emphasizes introspection and faith. He argues that God's existence is inherent within our comprehension, and the very act of conceiving Him necessitates His reality. While Anselm's phrasing can be intricate, the core idea is that the proof for God resides within our own minds. Essentially, he suggests that the truth about God is accessible through an examination of our own internal understanding, rendering external evidence superfluous. This concept, often referred to as faith in religious contexts, involves accepting truths that lack concrete, empirical validation.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas offers a distinctly different perspective. He contends that God's existence can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, bypassing the need for faith. This rational approach holds significant appeal for evangelism, as it could potentially attract new adherents by appealing to logic rather than requiring a leap of faith. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument hinges on the idea that the existence of God is a logical necessity, akin to deducing the existence of a missing puzzle piece based on the assembled fragments.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to become known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned earthly possessions and achieved enlightenment. His teachings ultimately gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. This religion, approximately two and a half millennia old, has evolved considerably since Buddha's time. This transformation is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Both monks and lay practitioners participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning any such celebration. These deviations extend from surface-level customs to the very essence of the religion's salvation doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist community, both within the monastic sphere and among lay followers, has undergone doctrinal shifts over time. These changes can be attributed to both internal and external influences, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently employ specific terminology. \"Internal\" refers to forces originating from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status. \"External\" forces encompass any influence from individuals outside Buddhism. \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Conversely, \"benign\" forces are those that neither intend to harm nor assist the Buddhist community, although their actions may inadvertently result in one or the other. These terms will recur throughout our exploration.\n\nInitially, it is crucial to examine the fundamental tenets of the religion—the doctrines that form the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.  The Dhamma essentially encompasses the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by comprehending these concepts can one attain liberation from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continues relentlessly.  Concurrently, Sansara will cease along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Monks, on the other hand, follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha, the truth that life is inherently suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico has been marked by periods of tension, particularly during the 19th century. This era, spanning roughly from 1836 to 1893, saw numerous conflicts and disputes between the two nations (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The most significant event of this period was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), which resulted in a U.S. victory and the annexation of territories including Texas and parts of the Southwest.  \n\nSuch intense rivalries between neighboring countries are not uncommon.  Shared borders often lead to competition for resources and differing perspectives on cultural and religious matters (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This dynamic is reflected in the historical relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, where clashes arose over issues such as religion, cultural traditions, and economic interests.\n\nScholar David M. Pletcher (1977) highlights the enduring nature of U.S. diplomatic challenges in Mexico and Cuba, noting that these nations stand apart from other Latin American countries in their historical relationship with the U.S. (p. 41). Pletcher's observation underscores the unique complexities in U.S.-Mexico relations, shaped by geographical proximity and a history marked by conflict.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations. As Sally Frahm (2001) points out, American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries mirrored the ideological struggles of the Cold War era, where the U.S. clashed with communism (p. 86). In this case, however, the ideological divide stemmed from religious beliefs rather than political systems. \n\nThis historical distrust between the U.S. and Mexico can be traced back to the lingering animosities between their former colonial powers, Spain and England.  This inherited animosity presented a significant obstacle to the development of amicable relations.  \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during this period of rivalry.  Most of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border incursions and frontier disputes (p. 145).  Banditry and outlaw activity crossing the border became a major concern, requiring military intervention by both nations to maintain order (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the U.S. economically (p. 109). Eventually, American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico, marking a turning point in their relationship (p. 110).",
            "A life-altering event occurred fifteen years ago, plunging me into a state of unexpected disability brought on by an illness I had never encountered before. At that time, I was a registered nurse, a profession I had chosen due to a deep-seated desire for the stability and security that had eluded me during my childhood.  The unwavering refrain I heard throughout my adolescence and beyond was, \"You'll always find work; people will always need medical care.\"  Although my true aspirations lay in the realms of science and journalism, perhaps a blend of both, I ultimately settled on nursing.\n\nHowever, fate took an unexpected turn. I found myself at the age of 46, single, with limited financial resources, and unable to work. The disability persists to this day, and after fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I am left with virtually nothing that I can truly call my own.  Each day is a struggle, a constant challenge to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty has become a defining aspect of my life; yet, there is one undeniable truth: I would not have endured these years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of cherished friends.  Let me assure you, when true adversity strikes, one's perceived strength can quickly diminish.\n\nLife is inherently unpredictable, full of both minor and major emergencies.  There are no guarantees, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges surpass our individual capacity to overcome.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that the United States should move away from excessive reliance on government programs.  Frankly, the current system is riddled with inefficiencies and is in dire need of reform. However, I believe a more pressing need is for Americans to rediscover the importance of mutual trust and support.\n\nRather than isolating ourselves and striving to secure our own individual survival, we should be fostering a culture of helping each other and extending a hand in need.  The notion of \"rugged individualism,\" often championed by conservative voices, overlooks the fundamental role compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources played in the nation's early development. The pioneers who ventured westward in wagon trains did not succeed by going it alone; their survival depended on collective effort and shared burdens.\n\nTherefore, while preparedness is essential, let us not neglect the importance of community.  Invest in a basic disaster kit: first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting and duct tape for potential emergencies, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the means, consider establishing a small farm and learning to preserve your own food, or investing in a wood stove if living in a suitable dwelling.\n\nBut most importantly, forge meaningful connections with your neighbors.",
            "The mechanisms driving evolutionary change in organisms are complex and multifaceted. While understanding these processes has long been a goal of biological study,  achieving a precise mathematical description of even the simplest organic forms remains a significant challenge. Despite this, recent advancements in mathematical modeling have allowed for explorations into the evolution of certain biological features.\n\nFor instance, mathematical models have been applied to the study of mollusk shell development, examining both ontogeny (individual development) and phylogeny (evolutionary history). Our research focuses on utilizing mathematical modeling, in conjunction with experimental investigations, to elucidate the factors influencing the direction and intensity of evolutionary-developmental changes in the gastropod genus *Prunum*.\n\nWe employed X-radiography to obtain quantitative measurements of shell morphology across various *Prunum* species.  These measurements were then incorporated into the CerioShell software program, allowing us to construct hypothetical shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of potential morphological variation within the genus.  The results of these modeling exercises will be integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary trends within this group.\n\nThe morphology of a shell can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional structure that evolves through time.  Individual spiral turns, known as whorls, encircle an imaginary central axis called the columella.  The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and the line separating each whorl is called the suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the body whorl.\n\nShells are often examined from four primary perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural.  In the \"conventional\" orientation, known as the apertural view, the aperture faces the observer and the apex points upwards.\n\nCounting whorls can be accomplished by first observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the beginning of the first suture. A line drawn through this point divides the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter whorl.\n\nViewing a shell as a series of apertures that unfold through time and space as the animal builds its shell provides a unique perspective.  The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with its horizontal and vertical radius.  This trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically.\n\nOnce a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, offering insights into the interplay between form and function in evolutionary processes.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality has plateaued over the past decade. Despite advancements in areas like water and sanitation, which align with the Millennium Development Goals, improvements in child and maternal health haven't kept pace with the targets set for 2015. This deceleration necessitates a deeper examination of the contributing factors, pointing towards the need for systemic health-sector strengthening rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has made strides in increasing births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, reaching 72%, this figure encompasses traditional providers like midwives. These individuals, while valuable, lack the medical expertise to manage complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate attributed to hemorrhage. Consequently, this indicator's improvement may be somewhat deceptive, highlighting the persistent need for further progress.\n\nFurthermore, the percentage of under-five children with diarrheal illnesses receiving professional treatment has declined. Though postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area also requires urgent attention, with low utilization rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain below expectations, hovering around 4%. This disparity is further amplified by the stark contrast between urban (7%) and rural (2%) c-section rates, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Access to quality care appears concentrated in urban centers, while rural communities face significant challenges.\n\nThe issue of vertical equity is equally concerning, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. This suggests a substantial barrier to healthcare access for the most vulnerable population, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nAddressing neonatal and maternal care improvements necessitates a fundamental question: Is it more effective to implement program-specific solutions or bolster the overall health system, encompassing pre- and postnatal care for mothers and infants? While targeted programs offer the allure of focused objectives and potentially faster results, several drawbacks warrant consideration.\n\nConcentrating resources on a specific health sector can lead to neglect in other areas, diverting funding and human resources.  The impact of HIV/AIDS funding on the family planning sector serves as a cautionary example. Additionally, parallel programs for a single area often result in duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts, leading to administrative complexities and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is often characterized by meticulous attention to detail and a prominent focus on the aristocratic class of that era. However, two notable novels, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" deviate from this established convention. Both stories incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, setting them apart from their contemporaries. This departure enriches the characters, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities. \n\nOne illustrative example can be found in this passage from \"Oliver Twist\": “And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220) \n\nThese novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and context of these moments vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these occurrences often reveal glimpses into Oliver's inner turmoil, his unspoken pain, and his growing awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. The shooting of Oliver, revisited vividly in chapter 28,  takes on a dreamlike quality as he struggles for help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events, and the dire consequences his health has suffered, highlighted by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he remains oblivious to the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away. He relives his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, experiencing a constant, fear-driven agony.  Oliver's helplessness raises questions about the source of his misfortune, as it's clearly not his own doing. This reinforces the idea that Oliver has little agency, unable to exert any control, even in the face of imminent danger. A growing sense of defeat pervades this scene, suggesting Fagin's influence has broken Oliver's spirit, forcing him to accept his despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it's reasonable to assume Oliver would have made some attempt to save himself.\n\n\nAnother example of this dreamlike state can be seen in \"Wuthering Heights\": “The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with elementary students in an after-school program. While I was capable of assisting in various subjects, my strongest areas were English and reading.  One particular student, a boy named Adrian, who I believe was in either third or fourth grade, presented a unique challenge. He struggled significantly with reading, displaying peculiar patterns. Some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him. It was quite perplexing. I knew Adrian was of Latino heritage, as he spoke perfect English.\n\nWe encountered difficulties until the day I met his mother. While the rest of the after-school group was on a field trip, Adrian's mother visited.  She didn't speak any English, only Spanish.  Fortunately, despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was then that a realization struck me: Adrian could read perfectly well, but he wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. \n\nWhile I'm unsure if this realization directly helped him, I sincerely hope he's doing better now.  \n\nSharing this story highlights the issue of the language barrier in our schools, particularly here in California. It demonstrates that challenges aren't always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can present significant obstacles.  This problem is widely recognized, but the question remains: what can we do about it?\n\nFor Adrian, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring focused on English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciation. However, the situation is far more complex for children with limited English proficiency. There isn't a single solution. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, none of these approaches alone can fully address this issue.  The key lies in a multifaceted approach, combining various methods.\n\nThe dual language system is a commendable concept, beneficial not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research indicates that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically.\n\nSome people fear that dual language programs are a waste of resources and that the majority of students won't benefit.  This is a misconception. Implementing these programs as the norm rather than the exception would benefit all children. \n\nBut how do we achieve this?  Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is unrealistic and impractical. However, I believe it's entirely feasible to have bilingual support staff, tutors, or assistants.",
            "From our earliest years, many of us are told about a presence greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp.  Some seek answers in religious institutions like Sunday schools or temples, while others look inward. Traditions often guide our beliefs, passed down through generations, but some reject them entirely, clinging to the confines of their own limited perspectives. Our values can shift and change throughout life, leading us on a personal quest to define our place in the universe. We yearn for guidance, a beacon of light to illuminate our path and lead us towards understanding.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father murmured, his gaze fixed on the rain drumming against the tin roof of our porch. We sat together, sharing a cigarette as the downpour soaked the plants lining the edge of the steps. He seemed lost in thought, his eyes reflecting a mixture of longing and memory.  His frame had become more fragile, his clothes hanging loosely on his weakened body. His hair, once thick, was now noticeably thinner. He avoided my gaze, staring out into the grayness. I felt a deep sense of isolation and fear, an inability to voice the overwhelming sadness that threatened to consume me. To speak of my impending loss would only amplify the reality, an unbearable truth for us both. I reached out, pulling him into a hug, and then settled back into my chair, drawing closer to his side. Together, we watched the rain cascade down on the twilight world.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father died. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but ultimately failed to ease his pain. He lingered beyond the doctors' predictions, trapped in a cycle of agony.  The purpose of this extended struggle remained a mystery to me. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I  whispered into the emptiness of the night, my prayers unanswered. It seemed as if any connection to a higher power had long since been severed.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final moments, the transition from life to whatever lay beyond.  Watching him fade away felt too painful, too final. I chose to remember him by the life he had lived, not by the way he died. I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be a passive observer at his deathbed. I retreated into the safety of my bed, curling into a tight ball, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nSilence. No one even bothered to call.",
            "The Gothic novel, as Ian Watt notes in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" presents a fascinating paradox: it's both \"old\" and \"new.\" This genre has been subject to a range of critical responses, from dismissal to praise, with accusations of shallowness countered by admiration for its exploration of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" often considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, ingeniously blended elements of both ancient and modern romances, forging a new literary expression. Walpole strategically employed theatrical conventions from the past, alongside a modern, more naturalistic approach, to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic architecture, theatre, and traditions, even though the term \"Gothic\" itself carried connotations of archaism and lack of sophistication in comparison to the perceived advancements of the contemporary era. The marriage of these theatrical elements with the novel's innovative format, allowing readers a more intimate understanding of characters' inner lives, contributes to the Gothic's enduring appeal. Despite its historical roots, it continues to resonate with readers across time, simultaneously feeling both outdated and refreshingly novel.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic literature is chivalry, a concept deeply rooted in the medieval period. The training and ideals of knighthood are both preserved and transformed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Gothic writers were particularly drawn to chivalry because it represented an idealized archetype: the brave, honorable, and competent knight. This ideal, they often perceived, had been lost in the complexities of contemporary society. Through the exploration of chivalric values and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the genre's future evolution into Romanticism. This nostalgic lens serves as a commentary on the present, suggesting a longing for a simpler, more virtuous age.\n\nWalpole, writing during a politically tumultuous period, was deeply concerned about the future. Facing personal challenges and accusations, he might have subconsciously yearned for the perceived moral clarity and inherent goodness of the \"Gothic past.\" This sentiment is evident in several characters, notably Frederic. Even before his introduction, Frederic is presented as embodying chivalric traits:\n\n[Insert description of Frederic here]\n\nThis description is heavy with traditional chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has suffered tragedy and is believed to have been killed by enemies, embodies the exaggerated image of the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a trope that would become quintessential to Gothic literature (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate network of activities involved in moving goods from the moment a customer places an order through the entire journey, encompassing raw materials, supply procurement, production, and finally, product delivery to the customer.  The term itself, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, encapsulates the overarching strategy of planning, implementing, and monitoring these interconnected processes to ensure customer needs are met efficiently and promptly.\n\nOliver's framework identifies six crucial elements that form the backbone of any effective supply chain: production, sourcing, inventory management, location strategy, transportation, and information flow. Business leaders leverage these elements to optimize customer service and satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial stage in this chain, lays the groundwork for the entire operation. It involves meticulously defining when, where, and how goods will be manufactured, taking into account customer demand.  Understanding market trends and analyzing consumer preferences are vital for managers to determine product specifications and production volumes.  \n\nOnce these key decisions are made, the focus shifts to selecting the optimal production location, considering factors like capacity, quality standards, and proximity to both suppliers and customers.  Efficient scheduling of work, alongside meticulous equipment maintenance, are crucial for ensuring smooth and uninterrupted production.  The production stage demands meticulous attention to detail, as any oversight can have significant financial and time-related repercussions.  Companies like Walmart and Target exemplify this by implementing detailed procedures and guidelines for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, thereby minimizing confusion and maximizing operational efficiency.\n\nThe second critical element, supply, involves strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships.  A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specialized expertise.  Managers must carefully assess which division is best suited for each stage of the production process.  Outsourcing certain tasks to external companies can also be a strategic choice. This is often done to enhance efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, allowing companies to focus on their core competencies while leveraging the specialized skills and resources of external partners.",
            "A curious scene unfolds on a bustling city street. Actress Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" stands alone, holding a cardboard sign aloft. The message, penned in bold black marker, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" This cryptic statement, while seemingly outlandish, hints at a deeper concern. \n\nBurma, officially known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation grappling with a complex political reality. Since 1962, the country has been governed by a military junta, a powerful group that seized control through a coup.  In 2007, a wave of public protests, the first in a decade, swept through the streets. These demonstrations, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" were spearheaded by Buddhist monks, their saffron robes a symbol of both their faith and their defiance. \n\nInitially, the government tolerated the peaceful gatherings, but the situation quickly escalated. What began as calls for reform transformed into a violent clash between the monks and the military. Monasteries were raided, foreign journalists were detained, and the world watched in horror as the situation spiraled out of control. The death toll, officially reported as 13, is disputed by some, with allegations of a much higher number of casualties.\n\nBurma's story is not unique. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute power. From the Roman emperors claiming divine authority to the current political landscape, the struggle between those in power and those seeking change is a recurring theme.\n\nExamples of this power struggle are etched in history. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 saw students, workers, and intellectuals calling for greater freedoms in China. The exact number of casualties remains shrouded in controversy, with official figures starkly different from independent estimates. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu extremists systematically targeted Tutsis and political moderates, serves as a chilling reminder of the brutality that can erupt when ethnic tensions are exploited for political gain. And of course, the horrors of the Holocaust, where the Nazi regime systematically persecuted and murdered millions of Jews, stands as a testament to the dangers of unchecked hatred and intolerance.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music can be largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his exceptional talent in molding his orchestra. While his piano presence might be understated in many of the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his ability to craft intricate and sophisticated pieces that allowed each band member to showcase their individual strengths.  \n\nEllington masterfully created a framework where soloists could freely improvise, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically highlighted the unique styles of his musicians, thus enriching the overall musical tapestry. This meticulous attention to detail resulted in cohesive and original soundscapes that perfectly complemented each piece. Ellington's profound understanding of each player's individual sound, as well as their collective synergy within the ever-evolving ensemble, enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and awe-inspiring compositions in jazz history. \n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative approach, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work demonstrates Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrics. Furthermore, \"Creole Love Call\" exemplifies Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his extensive discography. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition, comprising six distinct choruses, unfolds as follows:\n\n* **Chorus 1:**  A call and response exchange between the vocal and reed sections, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone, gradually transitioning to a rougher, more expressive quality towards the end.\n* **Chorus 2:** A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes, adding a layer of depth and melancholy.\n\n* **Chorus 3:** A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase, creating a sense of soaring beauty and intricate interplay. \n\n* **Chorus 4:** The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections, intensifying the musical conversation. \n* **Chorus 5:** The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by a syncopated stop time rhythm from the brass and rhythm sections, building to a powerful crescendo.\n* **Chorus 6:** A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call and response between the voice and reeds. In this iteration, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, showcasing its full instrumental potential as a solo voice. \n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, leaving a lasting impression.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice to add a unique tonal dimension to this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that consistently permeates his work.  In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly blends his skill in tight orchestration with his discerning ear for tonal color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously utilizes the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound.  \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands upon these ideas, as Ellington masterfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a prominent member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone, showcasing his ability to extract unique and unexpected sonic qualities from his musicians.",
            "Throughout her life, a persistent yearning had lingered within her. It was a craving that remained unfulfilled, a void she couldn't quite define.  This feeling first emerged when she was fourteen, on the cusp of adolescence, and continued unabated three years later at the age of seventeen. By then, she'd realized her desire wasn't for material possessions, but for companionship – a connection with another person.  However, she found herself unmoved by the attentions of boys who sought her out. They'd make clumsy attempts to win her affection, but none sparked any real interest. This perplexing lack of romantic interest led her to question herself relentlessly, trying to decipher the underlying cause of this unusual experience. Years of introspection had yielded various theories, but none felt substantial enough to warrant serious consideration. So, she carried on with her life, perpetually grappling with this enigmatic longing.\n\nHer typical days were marked by tranquility. Her parents were kind, composed individuals who rarely, if ever, clashed. Arguments with their daughter were equally infrequent. The only disagreements arose when she asserted her independence and free-spirited nature.  Though she was the daughter of a serene couple, her vibrant and engaging personality often contrasted with their calmness, making her a beloved and likable presence.\n\nToday, however, tranquility was absent. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, a piercing scream from the kitchen shattered the peace. It was her mother's voice, filled with distress. She rushed into the room, panic rising within her as she cried out, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother lay on the floor, grimacing in pain, uttering short, pained gasps.  Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a hand on her mother's arm in an attempt to offer comfort. \"Ouch...sweetheart, I...need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed, her words clipped and strained. Her daughter sensed the severity of her mother's condition. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mother gestured with her hands, and in that moment, the daughter felt immense gratitude for the strength-training classes she had taken.  She carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car, gently laying her down in the backseat, and then drove towards the hospital.\n\nThe sterile scent of disinfectant and the air thick with the aura of sickness and apprehension hung heavy in the hospital. But her daughter's focus remained solely on her mother. She swiftly wheeled her inside and called for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered around, and someone quickly retrieved a gurney and laid her mother on it.  She was whisked away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nLater, she learned that her mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach a vase from the top shelf of a cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern resembling the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a specific scoring system called the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and death from stroke. The aMed diet, a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while prioritizing monounsaturated fats over saturated fats.  Fish consumption is encouraged, and animal products and saturated fats are limited. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a link between following a Mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of overall mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these earlier studies did not specifically examine the connection between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis study followed a large group of 74,886 women, ranging in age from 38 to 63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term observational study involving 121,700 female nurses across eleven US states. These women had no history of CVD or diabetes at the start of the study.  \n\nOver a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, researchers assessed the participants' adherence to the aMed diet using detailed questionnaires about their food intake over the previous year. These questionnaires, known as \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs), underwent rigorous validation studies to ensure accuracy.\n\nInformation about CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke events was collected through medical records, hospital records, autopsies, and death certificates. When complete medical documentation was unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all stroke cases and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.  \n\nTo account for other factors that could influence the results, researchers collected data on each participant's body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of hormone therapy. Starting in 1986, information about their physical activity levels was also gathered.\n\nTo minimize the impact of random variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative average aMed scores based on the repeated FFQs, combining scores from the two preceding years. Statistical adjustments were made to control for potential \"confounding\" factors such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nA statistical technique called Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were created for fatal and nonfatal cases of both CHD and stroke.\n\nThe findings revealed a clear association: higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was linked to a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in these women.  Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest aMed quintile (meaning they adhered most closely to the diet) had a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The U.S. economy faced a severe downturn in 2007, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and widespread financial distress among major corporations. This economic instability continues to cast a long shadow, prompting us to examine its origins and potential solutions. At its core, the crisis stemmed from a combination of imprudent political decisions and flawed financial practices.  \n\nPressure from policymakers encouraged banks and financial institutions to extend subprime loans, fueling an already fragile financial infrastructure.  Government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were also incentivized to package these mortgages into complex securities known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, a ripple effect ensued, leaving banks with inadequate capital reserves and spreading the crisis throughout the financial system.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s during the Clinton administration. The President, seeking re-election, prioritized policies aimed at increasing his popularity, including relaxing lending standards. This, as noted by Steven Holmes of The New York Times in 1999, created a vulnerable environment for the housing market. Holmes observed that Fannie Mae, under pressure from both the Clinton administration and its shareholders, was aggressively expanding mortgage lending to lower and moderate-income borrowers. He prophetically warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. \n\nThe crisis was further exacerbated by the emergence of new and intricate mortgage products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs.  These complex instruments intertwined the housing market with other sectors of the economy, leading to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial institutions.  When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities faced catastrophic losses.\n\nThe crisis had a devastating impact on the financial landscape. Top U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage-related debt in 2007, representing approximately 30% of the nation's GDP.  Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at deeply discounted prices, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to stricter regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition. It's the part of the story where a writer attempts to weave intricate prose, captivating the reader's attention. Or, it can be the section where readers lose interest, their eyes glazing over as they long for the narrative to progress. Even seasoned authors like Dr. Merlin have been known to express frustration when faced with excessive exposition.\n\nThe key principle to remember is \"Show, don't tell.\"  Despite this, even experienced writers can fall into the trap of long, descriptive passages that lack action or momentum.  Exposition, in its purest form, is the act of directly conveying information to the reader, often in a straightforward manner. Think of a film scene where one character delivers a lengthy monologue, dumping a torrent of details on their counterpart.  In written fiction, this responsibility falls on the author.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine a story where the heroine's romantic history is laid out in stark detail: how she met her husband, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder.  While this information is crucial to the plot, delivering it in a two-page exposition would be jarring. Instead, the author should focus on showcasing the husband's character through his interactions and dialogue, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions.  Similarly, the heroine's personality should be illuminated through her reactions to her husband, demonstrating how his presence shaped her life.\n\nBy immersing the reader in these emotional nuances, the author can create a deeper connection to the husband's fate and, consequently, to the heroine's grief. The reader should feel the weight of his loss alongside the heroine, amplifying the emotional impact of the story.\n\nIn essence, the author must go beyond the mere outline of events and provide depth and substance to the narrative. It's tempting to rush through character development, but investing time in crafting a compelling backstory can significantly enhance the overall reading experience. For instance, a new character with a past in the Air Force, now working as a gas station night manager, might seem like a simple archetype.  However, delving into his motivations, dreams, and personal struggles can transform him into a multi-dimensional character that resonates with the reader.",
            "My television viewing this morning included two local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live broadcast from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011, led with a story about a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed. The report, which lasted approximately two minutes, indicated that the victim had sustained multiple stab wounds and that Hostettler had been apprehended. I felt the amount of time dedicated to this story was appropriate given its developing nature.\n\nThe second segment focused on a shooting that occurred earlier that morning in the Sharon Woods area, involving an 18-year-old male named Travis Buyers. Buyers sustained critical injuries, and at the time of the broadcast, no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was actively investigating the crime. I perceived this story as relatively brief, and I wondered if this brevity might be attributed to the victim's race. It's a concerning observation I've made over time: when minority individuals are victims of crime, media coverage often appears to be more limited compared to instances involving white individuals.  \n\nSubsequent segments covered a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter,  a weather forecast predicting rain and thunderstorms for the weekend, and a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The robbery story involved a description of the suspect, a black male, emphasizing his race and complexion, which I found somewhat unusual. \n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio.  The report mentioned his 300-month sentence, which I found interesting, as opposed to simply stating 25 years.",
            "The relationship between brothers is unique, characterized by an unbreakable connection that transcends the ordinary. This bond encompasses a spectrum of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers possess an innate understanding of each other, a depth of comprehension unmatched by any other relationship.  They see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes, not as others perceive them, but as their true selves. It is during moments of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond comes to light, revealing its inherent strength, for better or for worse.  The intensity of these emotions often carries significant consequences.  Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal link necessitates confronting the repercussions they bring.  When one can look into the eyes of a brother and see a mirror image of oneself, they see not a constructed facade, but an authentic reflection.  It is within their actions and the outcomes of those actions that their true character is revealed.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" delves into this theme, exploring the complex and often conflicting emotions that define the bond between brothers. Set against a backdrop of lush and vividly rendered landscapes, two brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile.  The narrative culminates in a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive the ordeal. This central theme is conveyed through a combination of direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which provides insight into the protagonist's internal world and his perception of his surroundings, both of which significantly influence his behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a singular, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful endeavor, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle.  He yearned for a brother who could share his experiences and accomplishments, a companion who could engage in activities such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\"  He envisioned a brother with whom he could share adventures, \"someone to race to Horsehead Landing...and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\"  However, Doodle's physical limitations, born from a weak heart that made survival a constant challenge, shattered these hopes. The protagonist, consumed by ambitious dreams, struggled to reconcile his aspirations with his brother's reality.\n\nHis anger towards Doodle is palpable as he recounts considering infanticide, contemplating suffocating the child. This disturbing thought reveals the depth of his frustration.  Yet, a simple smile from Doodle triggers a shift in his feelings, softening his resolve. This suggests that his initial thoughts were not firmly rooted in malice but rather a manifestation of his disillusionment.  Deep down, the protagonist possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human mind is a complex system designed for handling and generating information.  As our understanding of technology progressed from basic to advanced, the ways we've likened the brain to machines also evolved. Initially, comparisons were drawn to simple tools like wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, later shifting to more sophisticated analogies like books and, most recently, computers. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful, have their limitations and can sometimes lead to inaccurate conclusions about the brain's true nature.\n\nThe process of information management begins with input from our senses. These organs transform physical stimuli – things like touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrical and chemical signals. The brain then refines this raw data through a series of intricate algorithms, employing both bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine looking at a black square against a white background. Bottom-up processing helps us break down the image into its fundamental elements: color, shape, and edges. This allows us to recognize the distinct form of the square. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages prior knowledge and expectations to accelerate this recognition. In this case, it might help us instantly identify the object as a box rather than simply a collection of shapes.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain level, a specialized filter determines its significance and directs it to the appropriate cognitive functions. For example, while our brains constantly process visual data from our surroundings, our attention filter prevents us from consciously registering every blade of grass we see while walking. Conversely, it allows us to focus on our name even amidst a bustling crowd. This filtering process occurs at multiple stages, continually shaping the information we experience.\n\nFor the brain to function effectively, information must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods depending on the type of stimulus. For instance, spoken words can be encoded structurally (based on their appearance), phonemically (based on their sound), or semantically (based on their meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical signal circulating through a specific set of neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained through the physical structure of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. Some are based on how humans recall memories, while others draw inspiration from computer science or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as interconnected nodes, with links representing their relationships. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, *Brave New World*, the author paints a chilling portrait of a future where technology and capitalism intertwine to create a society that prioritizes manufactured happiness and societal conformity above individual expression and genuine connection. The novel explores the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its symbiotic relationship with a capitalist system that subtly manipulates and controls its citizens.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, Huxley's critique becomes even more apparent. The concept of \"homogeny,\" the suppression of individuality and diversity, and \"reification,\" the objectification of human beings as mere cogs in a machine, resonate throughout the novel. The citizens of *Brave New World* are conditioned from birth to embrace a singular ideology, their desires and aspirations carefully curated by the World Controller, who embodies the power of a dominant class.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class, or in this case, the lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.), are kept unaware of the true power dynamics at play. Their focus is diverted towards immediate gratification and consumerism, fueled by the constant bombardment of advertisements and the promise of instant pleasure. This manufactured contentment serves to pacify the masses and maintain the status quo, much like the Marxist notion of \"ideological control\" over the proletariat.\n\nThe novel further illustrates the concept of \"hegemony,\" where a dominant class maintains control over the rest of society through subtle and pervasive means. The World Controller, representing the elite Alpha and Beta castes, manipulates the system to ensure his own power and perpetuate the cycle of oppression. The lower classes, blissfully unaware of their true position within the social hierarchy, \"buy into\" the ideology that supports this structure, ultimately becoming complicit in their own subjugation.\n\nThe absence of meaningful relationships in *Brave New World* further highlights Huxley's critique of a hyper-capitalist society.  Characters lack depth and individuality, reduced to mere stereotypes that reinforce the homogenized nature of their world.  Love, genuine emotion, and authentic connection are absent, replaced by superficial interactions driven by fleeting pleasures and physical desires. The emphasis on superficiality and material possessions underscores the dehumanizing effects of a society consumed by consumerism and the pursuit of instant gratification.\n\nUltimately, *Brave New World* serves as a cautionary tale, warning us of the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its entanglement with a system that prioritizes profit over human well-being. Huxley's masterful use of satire and dystopian imagery compels us to examine the societal structures that shape our lives and to question the true cost of progress.",
            "My experience as a student at University Park spans approximately two and a half years, which translates to four and a half semesters of learning and growth. One recurring challenge for many, including myself, is navigating the sprawling campus. During my initial year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the furthest point eastward, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Journeys from my home in Stuart Hall to classes held in locations like Willard Building, closer to the campus core, often took upwards of 25 minutes on foot, particularly when inclement weather, a frequent occurrence in State College, hampered my progress.\n\nConversations with an alumnus, not significantly older than myself, revealed that the East Halls dorms were once isolated from the main university area by vast expanses of unused land. Today, that landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation. Sports fields, imposing new structures such as the recently constructed Creamery and health services buildings, and apartment complexes now occupy the space, effectively shrinking the distance between areas. As our campus continues to expand, the ease of traversing its vastness becomes increasingly problematic. \n\nWhat, then, is the most effective solution to this mobility quandary? On a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer. However, relying solely on bicycles is insufficient. Student engagement and campus design must be attuned to the needs of cyclists.\n\nRecently, I engaged in a discussion with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a multi-year hiatus. He expressed surprise at his own enjoyment, stating that, \"Bikes are fantastic; for a period, cycling wasn't considered trendy, but it's truly the most efficient mode of transportation.\"  Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling offers unparalleled efficiency in travel. A modest breakfast of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel one over 30 miles.  Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, a distance from the campus center comparable to some dormitories.  The most astute decision I made this year was acquiring a bicycle.  Daily commutes to Thomas Building, a location at least 25 minutes away on foot from my residence, have been significantly reduced to a mere 5 minutes when I apply sufficient pedal power.\n\nHowever, Pollock Road, the most direct route from my home to Thomas Building, presents challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists. While walking has its merits, my busy schedule leaves little room for extended walks. In the absence of my bicycle, walking would be my only reliable means of reaching my classes.  The daily trek to Thomas Building alone would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, translating to over two and a half hours each week.  Adding to this the time required for traveling to and from other classes, appointments, and various obligations, the cumulative time commitment would be unsustainable."

            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies.

            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v. Super. Ct. of Los Angeles Co., 598 P. 2d 853, 856 (Cal. 1979). ",
            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time.

And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway.

            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. "

            "My aspirations lie in the field of social work, specifically within the Division of Family and Children Services. I'm drawn to the opportunity to work directly with children who have experienced abuse or neglect, offering them support and guidance.  I believe my values align strongly with the core principles of social work: service, respect, ethical conduct, and a dedication to fostering healthier relationships.  These values are not merely professional ideals for me; they are deeply ingrained in my personal beliefs.\n\nMy desire to help others has always been a driving force, though my chosen path remained unclear for some time. Witnessing individuals grappling with personal challenges, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, fueled my desire to make a positive impact. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Piedmont College in 2009.  While I continued to explore different career options after graduation, a pivotal encounter solidified my commitment to social work.\n\nDuring a summer visit with a friend, I met a sixteen-year-old boy seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. His story deeply impacted me, prompting me to offer support.  I contacted the authorities and, despite their limited legal options,  I spoke with the boy's parents, expressing my concerns. Their evasive responses and attempts to dismiss the situation as \"simple\" solidified my resolve to pursue a career advocating for children in vulnerable situations. This experience highlighted the crucial role social workers play in protecting and supporting those facing familial challenges.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply with me.  As a society, we often champion the importance of individual uniqueness while simultaneously conforming to societal norms. This paradox is something I've actively challenged throughout my life.  From expressing my individuality through unconventional fashion choices and advocating for marginalized communities to actively participating in protests against racism and discrimination, I've consistently strived to promote equality and social change.\n\nMy commitment to social justice is unwavering, and I believe it will guide my work as a social worker, empowering me to advocate for the rights and well-being of all individuals.",
            "This paper explores the biological and sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The biological lens centers on genetic predispositions and medical factors influencing sleep. Conversely, the sociocultural approach examines environmental influences, considering the impact of race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. This review delves into both models, analyzing relevant research to illuminate their complexities.  Each study's findings are critically evaluated, highlighting their strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be categorized as primary, secondary to mental disorders, or secondary to other medical conditions. Primary sleep disorders encompass dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias include insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias. These conditions primarily affect the initiation and maintenance of sleep.  Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve behavioral or physiological disturbances during sleep, such as nightmare disorder, sleep terror disorder, sleepwalking disorder, and unspecified parasomnias. Sleep disorders secondary to mental disorders are linked to either Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review focuses primarily on insomnia, but will also briefly discuss primary sleep disorders in the context of both biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genes, inherited factors, and physiological mechanisms. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness.  One study investigated mice and discovered phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically implicated in sleep-wake states. Activating these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can reduce anxiety and induce sleep.  The GABAB agonist baclofen increased sleep duration (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that findings from animal models may be applicable to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Disruptions or absence of this receptor could potentially impair sleep without medication.  From a sociocultural perspective, if this phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep patterns. Alterations in the receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively impacting various aspects of life such as education, career, and daily tasks requiring focus and concentration.",
            "This exploration delves into three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). Firstly, a concise explanation of the disorder is presented. Subsequently, the diagnostic process is elucidated, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the paper concludes with strategies that educators in inclusive classroom settings can employ to support students with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes the effectiveness and efficiency with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Defined narrowly, CAPD focuses on the perceptual processing of auditory input within the CNS, encompassing the neurobiologic activity underlying this processing and generating electrophysiologic auditory potentials (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Essentially, it signifies a condition where the central nervous system, specifically the brain, struggles to process auditory information effectively. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity; they are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" Instead, the brain region responsible for translating sound, distinguishing words, and separating speech from background noise may not function optimally.\n\nThe earliest documented reference to this disorder, which later evolved into CAPD, dates back to the mid-1950s, termed \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were examining children with communicative disorders at the time. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari initiated the development of tests for these children in 1954.  In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 further stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in diverse ways. Individuals with CAPD may have difficulty localizing or perceiving sound in spatial contexts. They might struggle to differentiate between two or more distinct sound occurrences. Recognizing sound patterns or discerning changes in speech, such as sarcasm conveyed through variations in tone, could also pose a challenge. One sound might be masked by a subsequent sound, hindering their ability to process it.  Furthermore, they may struggle to synthesize auditory cues, interpreting them meaningfully to guide their actions.  Finally, determining the sequence of auditory information may be a challenge for individuals with CAPD.\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes systematic observation of listening behaviors and/or performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and psychologists. These professionals utilize a range of measures to assess auditory-related skills.  Evaluations may encompass questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including the individual's responses to specific stimuli. Currently, there is no single, universally accepted tool or test that consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate. Moreover, the exact cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, like a series of words or numbers. More sophisticated tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a potent tool for deception, its prolonged use can lead to a loss of self.  The act of revealing one's true identity, however, often carries the risk of social alienation. Ultimately, individuals must grapple with a difficult choice: prioritize their own authenticity or preserve their relationships, even if it means facing potential hurt or rejection from those around them. The play acknowledges that reactions to exposure can vary; some may remain unaffected, while others may be deeply offended by the deception.\n\nThe play's exploration of gender disguise adds another layer of complexity. It raises questions about the reasons behind individuals assuming identities that contradict their biological sex. In Viola's case, her decision to present herself as a man, Cesario, stems from a need for self-preservation in a foreign and potentially hostile environment.  As she states, she relied on the \"gentle help\" of her female attire to protect herself. (5.1.247-249) While this strategy proves effective, it also isolates her from female companionship, severing her from a vital support system.\n\nThe effectiveness of Viola's disguise becomes even more pronounced when Olivia, mistaking her for Sebastian, falls in love with her.  (\"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" 5.1.138)  This situation adds another layer of complexity to Viola's predicament, as she simultaneously navigates her own suppressed feelings for Orsino, who expresses his affection for her in her male guise. (\"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" 5.1. 260-261)\n\nDespite its potential to seem progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a commentary on the unveiling of suppressed emotions through deception.  The characters of Olivia and Orsino seem to grapple with unexpressed desires that are brought to the surface by Viola's presence as Cesario.  It raises questions about the nature of Olivia's attraction to Cesario: is it based solely on his perceived masculinity, or does it hint at deeper, perhaps subconscious, feelings for women? While some might argue that Olivia's character is a satire of those who judge solely on appearances, her swift shift in affections from Cesario to Sebastian, coupled with her acceptance of Viola as a sister rather than a love interest (\"A sister, you are she.\" 5.1.315), complicates this interpretation.",
            "The impact of German colonialism has been widely acknowledged for its harsh realities, particularly regarding the tragic events that befell the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa.  However, it's crucial to remember that such a vast colonial endeavor as Germany's cannot be solely defined by a single narrative.  The German empire exhibited a wide range of governing approaches and policies across its diverse territories, mirroring the geographical variations it encompassed.  \n\nSimilarly, educational initiatives implemented within these colonies displayed a spectrum of approaches. When British forces assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a substantial number of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German educational efforts. Contemporary writers also commended German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies.  \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a starkly different picture.  Unlike East Africa, where the government actively established public schools and played a central role in educating the native population, South West Africa saw the responsibility of native education largely delegated to missionary societies, which received limited government support.  Despite this, the German government did invest considerable resources in the education of European residents within the colony, developing a system of public schools and providing substantial backing and oversight for missionary schools. The lasting consequences of these educational policies in South West Africa were profound, extending even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies witnessed significant literacy and educational attainment among Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched, with the majority of its population lacking education and literacy. \n\nThis discrepancy in educational outcomes can be attributed to a complex interplay of social, political, and economic factors, which this paper aims to explore in greater depth.  A particular focus will be placed on newly available research that sheds light on the attitudes and perspectives of both colonial authorities and settlers towards the native African population.\n\n\nA wealth of academic material addresses the topic of education within the German colonial empire.  A significant proportion of these sources are in German and originate from the early twentieth century, encompassing the period of direct German colonial rule.  The initial emphasis of these works was primarily descriptive, outlining the key features of educational systems across the colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative analyses of education across various German colonies and more in-depth examinations of specific aspects of the educational landscape.  These studies consistently highlighted the significant variations in educational approaches across different colonies. \n\nCohen's study, which specifically focuses on education in both South West Africa and East Africa, stands out as a particularly relevant work for this paper. Cohen meticulously compares the educational systems of these two colonies, investigating the underlying factors responsible for their distinct characteristics.  Cohen posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a primary driver behind many of the unique features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonial holdings, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although a significant portion of the territory is characterized by arid desert. This relatively favorable environment attracted a larger European population to South West Africa.  By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, a figure significantly higher than the 5,336 Europeans living in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The realm of popular music has witnessed a remarkable expansion in its classification over the past century, encompassing a vast array of genres that are nearly impossible to enumerate exhaustively.  Adding to this complexity, most, if not all, established genres, including rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have branched out into multiple subgenres and sub-subgenres. Over the last 40 years, the subgenre of Heavy Metal rock has arguably emerged as one of the most multifaceted and expressive forms within popular music. Its expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, though these often lean towards the darker end of the emotional scale.  \n\nHeavy Metal's diversity is equally notable, as its inception sparked a wave of experimentation and innovation. Artists quickly recognized the genre's inherent flexibility and began crafting their own unique subgenres, which in turn gave rise to further subdivisions, creating a branching network of styles that continues to evolve today.\n\nWe now find ourselves at a juncture where the heavy metal movement encompasses a plethora of distinct niches, making it challenging to precisely define its boundaries. While it has absorbed influences from various other genres, its origins remain firmly rooted in a specific cultural context. To truly comprehend the diverse landscape of heavy metal music prevalent today, one must first delve into the nature of the movement itself, understanding why it transcends the confines of a mere genre label.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement characterized by a distinct aesthetic of darkness. It can be perceived as a \"music of more\"—more bass, more volume, more aggression, more theatricality. It embraces technical proficiency, moving away from primitivism and highlighting the virtuosity of the musicians. It is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement profoundly influenced by drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s fueled a wave of creative exploration, resulting in music that pushed the boundaries of convention and experimentation.\n\nThis dark, visceral quality was a departure from the prevailing trends in popular music, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of human emotion.  Subsequent generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the Romantic Era's exploration of darkness and emotional intensity. Lyrics often reflect this thematic preoccupation:\n\n(Byrne)\n\n\n These lyrics from \"Helter Skelter\" by the Beatles exemplify the darker side of their musical output, capturing a sense of emotional turbulence that some interpret as a reflection of drug-induced experiences. This song is considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of Heavy Metal, a response to the Rolling Stones' heavier, more intense music. The Beatles sought to demonstrate their own capacity for sonic aggression, incorporating this darker element into \"The White Album.\"",
            "Long before the Surrealist movement captivated the art world with its dreamlike imagery, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist artist, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and metaphorically. \"The Dream,\" a masterpiece from 1910, embodies not just a woman in awe of a fantastical landscape, but also Rousseau's personal aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and validation from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. This desire, however, presented him with a profound internal conflict.  The painting serves as a poignant reflection of Rousseau's lifelong struggle: should he conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain approval from the esteemed art world he deeply admired, or should he embrace his unique creative vision and forge his own path?\n\nTo fully grasp the layers of meaning within \"The Dream,\" it's essential to understand Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in the French town of Laval in 1844, Rousseau's upbringing was far removed from the world of art. His father, a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer, offered no formal art education. Instead, Rousseau dedicated his early years to working for the French government as a toll collector, although he was mistakenly labeled a customs inspector. The tragic loss of his wife, Clémence, and eight infant children left him with only his daughter, Julia, and an overwhelming sense of grief.  In painting, he sought solace, a fresh start, and an escape from his profound sorrow. Compared to his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant life in their art, Rousseau's work resonated with the hopes and dreams of the common people.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for acceptance within the art world can be attributed to several factors.  Unburdened by formal art training and embarking on his artistic journey later in life, he found himself competing with a generation of talented and already established modern artists.  Despite years of dedicated work, recognition eluded him until roughly the same time that Matisse began to rise to prominence. As art historian Jan Gordon notes in \"Modern French Painters,\" while Matisse and Rousseau were stylistic rivals, their motivations for painting differed significantly.  \"Matisse feared painting in a trite manner, while Rousseau's ambition was to create a conventional picture that would secure him a place within the prestigious Artiste Français,\" (92).",
            "Throughout history, numerous thinkers have proposed a deep connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting a fundamental link between truth and beauty. This belief stems from an intuitive understanding that resonates with our experiences. As John Keats aptly stated in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" \n\nWhile we acquire much of our knowledge through formal education or direct experiences, our appreciation for both ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional learning pathways.  Both disciplines, in essence, strive to illuminate rather than dictate. Our explorations into morality and beauty predominantly aim to decipher the reasons behind a work of art's allure or an action's ethical merit, rather than establish rigid rules for artistic creation or moral conduct. \n\nFurthermore, the critique of art or morality often falls short of fully capturing the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty.  Discussions surrounding the significance of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa,\" for instance, might delve into elements like composition, lighting, or historical context, yet these factors ultimately fail to encapsulate its artistic value.  When asked about a cherished artwork or literary piece, individuals frequently express a sentiment akin to, \"There's just something about it\" before elaborating further.  \n\nI contend that both art and ethics possess an inherent quality that transcends mere description.  Flannery O'Connor aptly remarked that \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how comprehensively we analyze the features of a literary work, a certain ineffable element remains.  \n\nI propose that ethics shares this characteristic.  Wittgenstein's assertion that \"Ethics cannot be expressed / Ethics is transcendental\" supports this notion. It is this elusive \"something,\" this je ne sais quoi, that constitutes the most compelling attribute of art and morality, and this transcendental nature serves as a bridge between the two.\n\nI believe the profound connection between morality and art stems from our profound, often inexpressible, engagement with them. They touch us at a level that transcends rational explanation, a notion aligned with Kant's concept of the noumenal. This link is particularly potent in the realm of literature. As McKean aptly notes, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its distinct culture woven into the very fabric of its landscape. From the Bavarian Alps in Munich to the coastal city of Kiel on the Baltic Sea, a shared identity resonates.  This cultural tapestry is further enriched as one travels along the Rhine River, passing through Cologne and reaching the historic city of Dresden nestled on the Elbe River in Saxony. This unique cultural blend is a testament to Germany's complex origins, stemming from a multitude of ancient tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the German people, Germania, carries a name shrouded in historical debate. Scholars and historians alike grapple with its true etymology.  Tacitus, a Roman historian, attributed the name to the Tungrians, a Germanic tribe who, according to his writings, bore the name \"Germans\" prior to their crossing of the Rhine and subsequent conflicts with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his accounts of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine from the subjugated Gauls.  He adopted the word from the Gauls themselves, highlighting the distinction between the two groups (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Some theorize that \"Germanus\" originated from a Gaulish word denoting a neighbor, while others suggest it derives from a spear known as a \"ger\" used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010).  Another possibility is that it stems from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" implying a perception of the Germans as loud and boisterous (Names of Germany).\n\nIn his influential AD 98 work, \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" Tacitus wrote extensively on the origins of the Germanic people, stating that \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nThe relationship between Rome and Germania remained complex. While the Romans engaged in trade with the Germanic tribes and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely refrained from extensive colonization.  Instead, the Germanic tribes flourished on the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods and utilizing their skills within the Roman army (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17).",
            "My gaze fell downward, my mind processing the scene before me with a detached clarity. Thoughts flitted in and out, a rapid stream of consciousness that felt more like observation than genuine reflection. It was as though I were observing my own mind working, dissecting the image without truly engaging with it.  \n\nOnce, influenced by an artist I collaborated with, I acquired a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" A lifelong desire to draw had led me to its pages, eager to unravel the mysteries of pencil strokes and the brain's interpretation of lines.  The book encouraged a technique where an artist frames a picture with an imaginary square, simplifying complex compositions. Transforming a bustling kitchen scene, for example, into a singular focus on a bowl of fruit.\n\nAt that moment, staring at the bowl before me, I couldn't conjure that artist's frame. I was overwhelmed, captivated, unable to do anything but simply look. Picasso had his blue period, Monet, his love for greens, and the Renaissance masters, their vibrant palettes. If I dared to dream of an artistic identity, this felt like the genesis of my work, the start of my own narrative, \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers touched the chosen tool of my craft, muscles tightening and relaxing as my hand moved through space, my thoughts taking form.  It could have been a moment of pure creation. Water swirled, smooth and clear, a serene dance of movement.  Particles detached, carried away to nothingness.  With increasing tension, my hand jerked, a spasm of anxiety, slamming the toilet handle again. The stubborn brown object refused to budge, clinging stubbornly to the bottom.\n\nHolding a mop loosely, feet planted, my green tie a constricting band around my neck, I frowned at the offensive package left as a message for the unfortunate souls tasked with cleaning the Rite Aid bathrooms. A few more flushes, a few more moments of contemplation, and my hand reached for the wall, gripping the roll of toilet paper. I began wrapping myself in it, mimicking an oven mitt.  Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped into the bowl, like a mother entering an oven to retrieve a Thanksgiving turkey.",
            "The alarming rate of fatalities involving young drivers demands our attention.  A confluence of factors contributes to this grim reality, posing a significant challenge to the safety of our youngest motorists. Research conducted by the National Institutes of Health highlights a crucial aspect of the problem: the adolescent brain is not yet fully developed to handle the complexities and dangers inherent in driving.  In addition to this neurological immaturity, inexperience plays a pivotal role.  \n\nThis lack of experience not only elevates the risk of fatal accidents but also increases the likelihood of rollovers, speeding incidents, and driving off the road.  Furthermore, studies, such as those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, have demonstrated a clear correlation between the presence of teen passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents.  \n\nWhile some states have implemented measures like provisional licenses, which restrict driving hours and passenger limitations for young drivers, these are, in my view, merely temporary solutions.  The core issue lies in the inherent limitations of adolescent drivers, as evidenced by statistical data.  \n\nDr. Marvin Zuckerman, a prominent psychologist, argues that even the age of 18 is too young to grant full driving privileges.  His research, as reported by USA Today, suggests a common inclination among individuals under the age of 20 to engage in risky behavior for the sheer thrill of it.  Therefore, delaying the onset of driving until this inherent risk-taking tendency diminishes seems prudent.  \n\nContinued issuance of driver's licenses to young teenagers will inevitably result in a tragic escalation of accidents and fatalities. This concern is amplified by the impending influx of new teen drivers as the children of Baby Boomers reach driving age.  By 2010, millions of these new drivers will be eager to take to the road.\n\nAddressing this urgent issue requires comprehensive legislative action.  Driver's education, a cornerstone of responsible driving, can continue to be provided in schools, but the minimum age for obtaining a driver's license should be raised to 18.  Provisional permits could still be issued, leading to full licensure after a certain number of supervised driving hours, similar to the existing regulations in many states, such as California's requirement of 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nThe implementation of uniform, nationwide legislation would effectively address this issue, safeguarding the well-being of young drivers across the nation. The proposed legislation is not without precedent, as similar measures have been explored and debated in various forums.",
            "My exploration of the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films led me to examine a fascinating group of fifteen \"trick films\" produced between 1895 and 1901. These films, characterized by their reliance on creative editing techniques, aimed to create captivating visual illusions. My analysis focused primarily on identifying the common stylistic elements present in the majority of these trick films, while also highlighting the unique characteristics exhibited by a select few produced later in the period.\n\nA prevailing trend in trick films of this era was their confined setting within a frontal proscenium. These films typically displayed no camera movement, opting instead for long and medium shots that adhered to a strict one-shot-equals-one-film principle. However, it's worth noting that some films from the early twentieth century dared to deviate from these conventions, incorporating elements such as multiple shots.\n\nOne of the most distinctive features shared by these trick films is their utilization of an interior set framed by a frontal proscenium. The camera remained stationary within this proscenium, refraining from following characters or objects as they moved. This compositional style, common in early cinema, drew inspiration from the theater and, specifically for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts.  A limitation inherent in this stage-bound approach is that the characters in trick films generally move only side to side, without progressing towards or away from the camera. For example, in the film \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900), actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even as they exit the frame, the camera does not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium composition also contributed to the prevalence of long shots and, less frequently, medium shots. Close-up shots were absent from all the trick films examined in the Edison catalog. This mirrored the theatrical and vaudeville tradition, where the audience viewed the entire performance at once, framed by the stage boundaries. As actors in these early films typically remained in the middle ground and did not approach the camera, close-up shots were rarely used.\n\nGenerally, most early trick films adhered to the principle that one conceptual shot equaled one film. This convention limited the length of most trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second employed. It also constrained the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which primarily focused on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and quick exchanges with minimal storyline.\n\nIt's important to note that a \"shot\" in a trick film, from the viewer's perspective, does not always equate to a single physical shot. A single \"shot\" might actually consist of several segments joined together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For instance, a closer examination of \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earlier trick films, reveals the point where the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head\" begins, even though the entire film appears as a single shot to the viewer.",
            "A prominent figure in the early Republican movement, John Taylor of Caroline, was deeply passionate about the ideals of self-governance and individual liberty. His background in agriculture, coupled with his brief foray into politics, shaped his persona as a man known for his staunch convictions and outspoken advocacy for personal freedoms and limited government intervention. Taylor's agrarian worldview served as the foundation for his political philosophy, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.  He believed that the nascent United States possessed a unique opportunity to establish an exemplary system of government, free from the constraints of pre-existing traditions.  This absence of historical precedent, he argued, allowed for the creation of a truly self-governing nation.  Taylor was a fervent believer in the inherent rights of individuals, emphasizing their interdependence –  a notion that if one right was compromised, the entire fabric of liberty would weaken.  He argued that these fundamental rights should be protected from governmental encroachment.  \n\nTaylor viewed the so-called \"state of nature\" as a scenario where those with physical strength and cunning exploited the vulnerable.  He maintained that civilization, however, should strive to transcend this natural order, ensuring fairness and equity for all.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor advocated for a government that acknowledged the duality of human nature – both its inherent goodness and its potential for evil. He held firm to a strict dualistic moral framework, asserting that government, being an extension of humanity, would inevitably reflect both its virtues and vices.  Taylor defined virtuous principles as those that safeguarded private property, fostered agricultural development, and tempered the excesses of capitalism. He believed that a government grounded in such principles could function effectively regardless of the individuals who held power, which he believed would always be susceptible to avarice and self-interest.   \n\nWhile acknowledging that self-interest was a fundamental human drive, Taylor viewed it as a problematic force when it transcended the common good and led to the creation of sub-societies that thrived at the expense of others.  He argued that a well-constructed government was essential to contain these negative tendencies and, even then, it required constant vigilance to prevent the erosion of its principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor championed a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly delineated within its text.  He feared that an expansive federal government would be both financially burdensome and prone to tyranny.  However, Taylor cautioned against a purely literal interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it risked obscuring the intent of its framers and paving the way for corruption.  He further asserted that the Declaration of Independence served as the true founding document of the United States, as it more explicitly articulated the nation as a federation of sovereign states rather than a single, unified entity.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This downturn was somewhat concerning, and the precise cause remains unclear. Several factors could have contributed to this trend. \n\nThe onset of winter at a New England university likely impacted commuting patterns, as bicycle and pedestrian traffic naturally decreases during colder months. Additionally, December coincides with the end of the fall semester, a time of intense academic focus and final preparations. Amidst this flurry of activity, maintaining consistent participation in the commuter log initiative may have been challenging.  Furthermore, December marks the beginning of the holiday season, leading to a month-long break for students and faculty, during which campus presence is significantly reduced. This extended absence could explain the low log submissions in January as well. However, the continued low engagement in February suggests additional factors at play.\n\nIt's possible that the initial enthusiasm surrounding the project naturally waned over time, a common phenomenon in any new initiative. To counteract this potential decline, we implemented the \"Carpool Challenge Week\" in March, a concentrated effort to revitalize participation. This campaign successfully resulted in a noticeable increase in log submissions. \n\nTherefore, a key challenge we encountered was sustaining project momentum, addressing both the inherent ebb and flow of engagement and the unique disruptions caused by academic breaks and holidays inherent to higher education.\n\nAnother challenge, common to any alternative commuting project, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for personal vehicle use.  To encourage participation, we offered a variety of prizes, including gift certificates to local businesses, aiming to provide tangible incentives for adopting alternative transportation. While these incentives proved effective, it's interesting to speculate on the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or even electric cars. These more substantial rewards could have potentially mitigated the decline in engagement. The value of the prizes remained consistent throughout the project. However, a dynamic approach, gradually increasing the value of prizes over time, might have yielded more sustained interest.",
            "Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, much like index funds. However, ETFs offer enhanced flexibility, trading on stock exchanges just like individual stocks.  This allows investors to benefit from the diversification of index funds while enjoying the advantages associated with stock ownership, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractional shares.  Despite these appealing attributes, it's important to note that ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.  A potential drawback is the presence of trading commissions on ETF transactions, similar to stock purchases.\n\nOne of the notable strengths of ETFs lies in their broad selection.  While the stated benefits are readily apparent, discerning investors should always critically assess whether these benefits, particularly diversification, are truly realized and to what extent. This analysis will focus on the ETF IHF, comparing its performance to the top ten holdings that constitute its portfolio.  The aim is to determine if the purported advantages of owning a single ETF compare favorably to those of owning a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks. Additionally, we'll explore alternative stock configurations that could potentially yield a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\nFor the sake of manageability, we'll concentrate on the top ten holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets.  A breakdown of these holdings and their respective asset percentages is provided below.\n\nTo gauge the extent to which these ten stocks represent the overall performance of the IHF ETF, we can utilize the current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their individual contributions to a hypothetical portfolio's beta and return.  This hypothetical portfolio would be composed entirely of these ten stocks, held in the proportions reflected in the ETF's holdings. The calculated beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings yields a return that is 6.11% higher than the ETF, representing a 16% increase in returns. Furthermore, the beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF as a whole.  Based on these preliminary results, a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings appears to offer the potential for higher returns coupled with a reduced beta. However, it's essential to consider the possibility that the observed differences between these two portfolios may not be statistically significant.\n\nTo ascertain whether these portfolios exhibit statistically significant differences, we will determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks. These standard deviations will be normalized to 100% for comparative purposes, allowing us to assess their cumulative standard deviation relative to that of the IHF ETF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" among his more accomplished poetic works. Within the poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" on two occasions, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by Poe scholar, Mabbott. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, believed by the ancient Greeks to mark the edge of the known world. While Virgil's usage is documented, it's worth noting that Poe's familiarity with the term might have stemmed from contemporary German literature. \n\nPoe was deeply interested in German authors, and this influence is evident in his work.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's poem and the works of German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, suggesting that Poe might have been inspired by Goethe's writings.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a renowned figure in literary circles, particularly for his two-part poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in 1808 and 1832, the latter coinciding with Goethe's death.  Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This narrative centers on a king who, after his wife's death following a gift of a goblet, descends into despair through heavy drinking and mourning.  Driven by grief, he relinquishes his possessions to his children, except for the goblet, before ultimately choosing to end his life by throwing the goblet into the ocean and leaping from a cliff. The emotional state and demeanor of the King of Thulé resonate with the speaker's portrayal in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" potentially mirroring Poe's own personal struggles and coping mechanisms.  Furthermore, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a production occurring just a year before Poe used the term \"Thulé\" in his own work, \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe's engagement with the concept of \"Thulé\" is notable. While he uses \"ultima Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he employs the term twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem's beginning and end.  Both \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces, sharing thematic and emotional parallels. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker describes a desolate landscape in Thulé, characterized by darkness, solitude, haunting memories, and a world devoid of color, mirroring the emotional desolation of the King of Thulé in Goethe's poem, who has lost his wife, his will to rule, and his desire to live.  \n\nGiven his admiration for Tennyson, it is highly probable that Poe would have been acquainted with Goethe's work, which was experiencing a surge in popularity after its initial publication.",
            "The potential for punitive damages in a case involving a customer's injury from a slip and fall due to an applesauce spill in a California grocery store presents a compelling legal question.  \n\nA judge is unlikely to immediately dismiss a claim for punitive damages brought by Jennifer Palmer.\n\nTo successfully argue for punitive damages, Palmer must demonstrate that the store manager, Martin, acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm his actions could cause. Evidence suggesting Martin's awareness of prior slip-and-fall incidents at the store, coupled with his inaction despite being informed of the spill twice, could support this claim.  While the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less straightforward, it remains plausible given the history of similar incidents and his failure to prioritize customer safety.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin to an applesauce spill. Martin, however,  claimed he was on his dinner break and declined to address the issue.  Tragically, just fifteen minutes later, Palmer slipped and sustained a serious back injury.  Prior to this incident, five other slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at the store that year. Palmer is now pursuing both compensatory and punitive damages against D&D Markets for her injuries.\n\nCalifornia law allows for punitive damages in cases where a defendant's conduct demonstrates \"oppression, fraud, or malice\" and is not related to a contractual obligation.  \"Malice\" in this context refers to conduct intended to cause harm, or, in the absence of intent, conduct that is \"despicable\" and carried out with a conscious disregard for the safety and rights of others.  Courts have recognized \"malicious\" conduct as encompassing situations where a defendant is aware of potential dangers resulting from their actions and intentionally chooses to ignore them.",
            "During my studies at CBC, I encountered a course on Islam that sparked considerable debate within the class. One central question that emerged, and one that feels even more pertinent today, was the nature of Islam as a religion – specifically, whether it inherently promotes hostility.  \n\nObserving the media landscape since 9/11, I've witnessed a dramatic shift in portrayal. Initially, Islam and its adherents, particularly extremists, were often presented negatively. Now, however, there seems to be a pendulum swing towards an almost excessive tolerance, a trend that feels somewhat unprecedented.  \n\nConsider the fact that in 2001, a presidential candidate with the name Barack Obama, whose family history demonstrably includes Muslim roots, would have likely faced significant public scrutiny. This suggests a noticeable evolution in societal perceptions.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad deeply intrigued me, presenting a seemingly paradoxical picture. Based on my prior understanding of his historical context, I had formed an image of Muhammad as a forceful leader who, through conquest, imposed Islam upon conquered tribes. However, the biography paints a different portrait – that of a misunderstood martyr, even one who humbled himself before others. It suggests a gradual awakening, where individuals, drawn to his teachings, sought him out, recognizing the \"truth\" he embodied.\n\nThere are intriguing parallels between Muhammad's ministry and the narratives surrounding Jesus's miracles. One striking example is the story of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk, providing sustenance for a large group of forty men. This stylistic choice, I believe, aims to portray Muhammad as a humble prophet, one who didn't seek to prove himself but lived authentically, guided by miracles. I find this approach problematic, as it arguably diminishes the unique significance of Jesus's miracles. It feels as if an attempt is being made to subtly equate the two figures, potentially even appropriating aspects of Jesus's life and persona for Muhammad.\n\nFurthermore, the biography frequently employs anecdotal accounts, often relayed through multiple intermediaries. While these stories are intended to offer evidence of individuals' independent conversions to Islam, the reliance on secondhand information weakens their credibility. This layering of sources raises doubts and detracts from the stories' impact.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a godly figure – humble, wise, gentle, and endearing. This portrayal contrasts starkly with historical accounts that challenge the notion of Muhammad as a gentle and humble individual. I can't help but wonder if Muslims today, privy to a more nuanced understanding of Muhammad's rise to power, might hold differing views.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought following Jesus's life presents a fascinating trajectory.  While his original teachings served as a foundation, subsequent developments within the faith have undeniably diverged from its earliest expressions.  Observing this historical progression, one discerns a noticeable shift towards greater intellectual and societal liberalization.  Despite the inherent resistance to change often displayed by traditionalists, their influence may prove insufficient to halt this broader trend.\n\nThe future holds the promise of a burgeoning awareness within the Christian community, a growing desire to differentiate between doctrines that have emerged over time and the core tenets espoused by Jesus himself.  This yearning for historical clarity, though perhaps spanning decades or even centuries, is likely to yield an inevitable outcome: a significant reversal in the course of Christian history.  \n\nImagine a movement gaining momentum, systematically dismantling layers of accumulated doctrine, akin to rewinding a clock, until only the essence of Jesus's original message, unadulterated by later interpretations, remains.  As this tide sweeps across nations like the United States and Europe, inspiring widespread adherence to Jesus's teachings, the institutional Church will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in guiding this transformation.  However, this theological regression will paradoxically usher in a period of increased uniformity within Christendom.  \n\nThe vast diversity that currently characterizes the Christian landscape will gradually give way to greater homogeneity of belief and practice.  Regional, denominational, and sectarian distinctions will fade, replaced by a renewed emphasis on shared core values.  \n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals.  The Roman Empire, once a persecutor of Christians, eventually embraced Christianity as its state religion.  Within our own nation, the trajectory from African-American slavery to African-American leadership exemplifies this phenomenon.  The impending reversion within the Christian faith will similarly unfold, retracing its steps to the source, while simultaneously diminishing its present-day diversity.\n\nA crucial factor in this process will be the reinterpretation of Jesus's words as metaphorical, rather than literal pronouncements.  This shift in perspective will pave the way for a deeper understanding of his message and its enduring relevance.\n\nTracing the origins of Christianity, we encounter Judaism, the faith that served as its theological progenitor.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established itself as a monotheistic religion, with divinely revealed scriptures and a strong sense of authority.",
            "The novel \"The Jungle\" delves into the darker facets of human nature, suggesting that beneath the surface, individuals are driven by a powerful, often selfish, desire for personal gain. The characters inhabiting Sinclair's world demonstrate a stark prioritization of self-interest, often at the expense of those less fortunate.\n\nThis is most prominently illustrated in the actions of the factory owners and managers. Their ambition knows no bounds, relentlessly pursuing expansion and profit, unconcerned with the human cost of their endeavors. Sinclair's vivid imagery, like the \"line of buildings standing clear-cut and black against the sky,\" juxtaposes the stark industrial landscape with the relentless pursuit of economic progress. The accompanying \"river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\" serves as a potent symbol of the environmental and societal consequences ignored in the pursuit of wealth.\n\nThe callous disregard for worker well-being is equally apparent.  The factory environment is characterized by \"jealousies and hatreds,\" where \"a man counted for nothing against a dollar.\"  Employees are subjected to grueling hours and the constant threat of arbitrary layoffs, with no safety net or recourse.  The absence of worker protections during this era allowed factory owners to operate with impunity, exploiting their workforce and creating a system where survival itself was precarious.  \n\nEven the attempts at collective action, through unions, were often compromised, further highlighting the power imbalance and leaving workers trapped in a cycle of exploitation. The stark comparison to chattel slavery underscores the dehumanizing conditions endured by those who lived and worked in Packingtown, their lives consumed by the relentless demands of the industrial system.",
            "Numerous authors employ diverse strategies to evoke specific sentiments or perspectives in readers regarding significant themes. The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of these methods in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\"  He frequently juxtaposes adjectives and nouns that don't conventionally align, thereby imbuing subjects with a particular aura. Additionally, he ascribes meaning to symbols and subsequently leverages them for a similar purpose. Fitzgerald prominently employs this latter technique with various colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.  Within \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald meticulously constructs symbolic meanings for colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to evoke specific feelings associated with pivotal objects.\n\nThe connotation Fitzgerald cultivates and employs for white/gray is that of homogeneity, with white representing a refined and elevated status, while gray signifies an older, more faded aspect. He establishes this association early in the novel through consistent depictions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually \"in white\" (8)—in fact, everyone seems perpetually clad in white: Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instance where individuals deviate from white attire occurs during Nick's perception of Gatsby's party: \"the halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further refines the significance of these two colors by associating them with commonplace, unassuming subjects. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's party guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. Catherine's apartment is characterized as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). He also portrays ordinary people or locations using white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19). The valley of ashes boasts \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23). The \"Italian child\" by the railroad is \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nAfter establishing sufficient meaning for white/gray, Fitzgerald utilizes them to signify insignificance or uniformity in relation to certain subjects. This application of color symbolism to reveal underlying meanings commences with Daisy. Following a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald portrays Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; readers begin to perceive Daisy less as a multifaceted character and more as a uniform element, a mere object of Gatsby's desire (74). Fitzgerald amplifies this impression of Daisy's uniformity through further instances, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County enjoys a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant, sunny climate.  Popular crops grown in the region include tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers.  There's a significant demand for organic, community-supported agriculture products in the San Diego area, with numerous local organizations experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also in high demand.  Many organic farms offer tours, allowing visitors to learn about agricultural practices while enjoying recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. \n\nThis type of operation presents an opportunity for landowners to leverage government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat quality, thereby creating avenues for farm tours, educational programs, and additional income streams.\n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming practices often lead to increased biodiversity in both plants and wildlife. This is attributed to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming can be more expensive than conventional methods in certain aspects.  It requires more hands-on labor and management to control pests, weeds, and fertilize the soil naturally.  Losses are often higher compared to conventional methods, and smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale found in larger operations.\n\nPractices that benefit wildlife, even if not directly related to organic farming, can also increase labor costs.  These practices include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotation, managing invasive species, and actively cultivating plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edges or open areas. \n\nTherefore, landowners in this scenario may seek financial assistance or expert guidance in maximizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen land, a 160-acre parcel adjacent to Potrero, California, encompasses chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland bordering the Cleveland National Forest. Situated in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, it falls under the purview of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. Currently under review, this plan identifies over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered or threatened. These include the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, various butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. \n\nThis area holds historical significance, having been inhabited by Native Americans for generations before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 19th century. This particular land parcel, originating from an early homestead patent, likely served as grazing land and/or a source of wood for many years.\n\nTo illustrate potential pathways for a small farmer, I selected a property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to determine feasible options for cost mitigation and wildlife conservation.  As a practical example, I identified an existing organic farm in the same region to demonstrate achievable goals.",
            "Cultural nuances significantly impact any negotiation process. Culture, more than a fixed entity, is a dynamic interplay of shared values, beliefs, and practices. It's crucial to recognize that generalizations about entire cultures, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are overly simplistic and potentially misleading. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be helpful, a successful negotiator delves deeper, understanding the specific cultural context of the situation and how it might influence interactions at the negotiating table. \n\nWhen encountering a new culture, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own cultural background. However,  attempting to truly grasp another culture involves a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical understanding, awareness of potential biases, and a willingness to accept cultural differences without judgment. Rather than trying to change or impose one's own cultural norms, it's essential to work within the boundaries of the other culture, especially when in a weaker negotiating position.  Respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territories can be instrumental in overcoming cultural barriers and fostering productive dialogue.\n\nIt's important to remember that cultural influences extend beyond national borders.  Within a single nation, diverse corporate cultures can emerge, shaping work environments and interactions.  These differences manifest in various ways, including dress codes, communication styles (direct versus indirect), delegation practices, and even employee engagement in philanthropic activities.  Examining the spectrum of American corporate cultures, from region to region and urban to suburban settings, highlights the richness and complexity of cultural influences within a single society.  While some cultures might appear more homogenous on the surface, a deeper exploration often reveals a surprising degree of internal diversity.\n\nValues serve as the foundation of a culture, providing the underlying \"why\" behind its practices. Understanding these core values is crucial for successful negotiation. For example, cultures that prioritize saving face or communal harmony might discourage public criticism or confrontation, even in negotiations. Conversely, cultures that value assertive bargaining might prioritize securing the best possible deal, potentially delaying a settlement.  \n\nWhile recognizing these cultural tendencies is essential, a negotiator should also strive to understand their counterpart on a personal level to build rapport and enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God,’”  found in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This belief, which we will explore in relation to another prominent theologian, Thomas Aquinas, posits the existence of a specific God – the God of the Bible.  To ensure a meaningful comparison of their arguments, we will proceed under the assumption that both Anselm and Aquinas hold this conviction. \n\nAnselm's approach to understanding God emphasizes introspection and faith. He argues that God's existence is inherent within our comprehension, and the very act of conceiving Him necessitates His reality. While Anselm's phrasing can be intricate, the core idea is that the proof for God resides within our own minds. Essentially, he suggests that the truth about God is accessible through an examination of our own internal understanding, rendering external evidence superfluous. This concept, often referred to as faith in religious contexts, involves accepting truths that lack concrete, empirical validation.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Aquinas offers a distinctly different perspective. He contends that God's existence can be demonstrably proven through reason and observable evidence, bypassing the need for faith. This rational approach holds significant appeal for evangelism, as it could potentially attract new adherents by appealing to logic rather than requiring a leap of faith. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument hinges on the idea that the existence of God is a logical necessity, akin to deducing the existence of a missing puzzle piece based on the assembled fragments.",
            "In the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince destined to become known as Buddha was born. Throughout his life, he abandoned earthly possessions and achieved enlightenment. His teachings ultimately gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada Buddhism being its most traditional branch. This religion, approximately two and a half millennia old, has evolved considerably since Buddha's time. This transformation is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Both monks and lay practitioners participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning any such celebration. These deviations extend from surface-level customs to the very essence of the religion's salvation doctrine. The Theravada Buddhist community, both within the monastic sphere and among lay followers, has undergone doctrinal shifts over time. These changes can be attributed to both internal and external influences, both positive and negative.\n\nThis discussion will frequently employ specific terminology. \"Internal\" refers to forces originating from members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of their monastic status. \"External\" forces encompass any influence from individuals outside Buddhism. \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. Conversely, \"benign\" forces are those that neither intend to harm nor assist the Buddhist community, although their actions may inadvertently result in one or the other. These terms will recur throughout our exploration.\n\nInitially, it is crucial to examine the fundamental tenets of the religion—the doctrines that form the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.  The Dhamma essentially encompasses the Tripitaka, the three baskets of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka outlines the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism. These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering), and Anicca (impermanence). Only by comprehending these concepts can one attain liberation from Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which continues relentlessly.  Concurrently, Sansara will cease along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), leading to enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka establishes rules for living. Laypeople adhere to five precepts: refrain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and intoxicants. Monks, on the other hand, follow a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha, the truth that life is inherently suffering. Second, attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico has been marked by periods of tension, particularly during the 19th century. This era, spanning roughly from 1836 to 1893, saw numerous conflicts and disputes between the two nations (Diehl and Goerts, 2000, p. 145). The most significant event of this period was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), which resulted in a U.S. victory and the annexation of territories including Texas and parts of the Southwest.  \n\nSuch intense rivalries between neighboring countries are not uncommon.  Shared borders often lead to competition for resources and differing perspectives on cultural and religious matters (Schmitt, 1974, p. 30-31). This dynamic is reflected in the historical relationship between the U.S. and Mexico, where clashes arose over issues such as religion, cultural traditions, and economic interests.\n\nScholar David M. Pletcher (1977) highlights the enduring nature of U.S. diplomatic challenges in Mexico and Cuba, noting that these nations stand apart from other Latin American countries in their historical relationship with the U.S. (p. 41). Pletcher's observation underscores the unique complexities in U.S.-Mexico relations, shaped by geographical proximity and a history marked by conflict.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations. As Sally Frahm (2001) points out, American opposition to Catholicism and monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries mirrored the ideological struggles of the Cold War era, where the U.S. clashed with communism (p. 86). In this case, however, the ideological divide stemmed from religious beliefs rather than political systems. \n\nThis historical distrust between the U.S. and Mexico can be traced back to the lingering animosities between their former colonial powers, Spain and England.  This inherited animosity presented a significant obstacle to the development of amicable relations.  \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) documented 17 disputes between the U.S. and Mexico during this period of rivalry.  Most of these conflicts centered on territorial issues, including border incursions and frontier disputes (p. 145).  Banditry and outlaw activity crossing the border became a major concern, requiring military intervention by both nations to maintain order (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nAccording to Schmitt (1974), the rivalry gradually diminished as Mexico became increasingly reliant on the U.S. economically (p. 109). Eventually, American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic influence in Mexico, marking a turning point in their relationship (p. 110).",
            "A life-altering event occurred fifteen years ago, plunging me into a state of unexpected disability brought on by an illness I had never encountered before. At that time, I was a registered nurse, a profession I had chosen due to a deep-seated desire for the stability and security that had eluded me during my childhood.  The unwavering refrain I heard throughout my adolescence and beyond was, \"You'll always find work; people will always need medical care.\"  Although my true aspirations lay in the realms of science and journalism, perhaps a blend of both, I ultimately settled on nursing.\n\nHowever, fate took an unexpected turn. I found myself at the age of 46, single, with limited financial resources, and unable to work. The disability persists to this day, and after fifteen years of relying on Social Security Disability, I am left with virtually nothing that I can truly call my own.  Each day is a struggle, a constant challenge to my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Uncertainty has become a defining aspect of my life; yet, there is one undeniable truth: I would not have endured these years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of cherished friends.  Let me assure you, when true adversity strikes, one's perceived strength can quickly diminish.\n\nLife is inherently unpredictable, full of both minor and major emergencies.  There are no guarantees, and no matter how diligently one prepares, some challenges surpass our individual capacity to overcome.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that the United States should move away from excessive reliance on government programs.  Frankly, the current system is riddled with inefficiencies and is in dire need of reform. However, I believe a more pressing need is for Americans to rediscover the importance of mutual trust and support.\n\nRather than isolating ourselves and striving to secure our own individual survival, we should be fostering a culture of helping each other and extending a hand in need.  The notion of \"rugged individualism,\" often championed by conservative voices, overlooks the fundamental role compassion, mutual respect, and shared resources played in the nation's early development. The pioneers who ventured westward in wagon trains did not succeed by going it alone; their survival depended on collective effort and shared burdens.\n\nTherefore, while preparedness is essential, let us not neglect the importance of community.  Invest in a basic disaster kit: first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, plastic sheeting and duct tape for potential emergencies, flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods. If you have the means, consider establishing a small farm and learning to preserve your own food, or investing in a wood stove if living in a suitable dwelling.\n\nBut most importantly, forge meaningful connections with your neighbors.",
            "The mechanisms driving evolutionary change in organisms are complex and multifaceted. While understanding these processes has long been a goal of biological study,  achieving a precise mathematical description of even the simplest organic forms remains a significant challenge. Despite this, recent advancements in mathematical modeling have allowed for explorations into the evolution of certain biological features.\n\nFor instance, mathematical models have been applied to the study of mollusk shell development, examining both ontogeny (individual development) and phylogeny (evolutionary history). Our research focuses on utilizing mathematical modeling, in conjunction with experimental investigations, to elucidate the factors influencing the direction and intensity of evolutionary-developmental changes in the gastropod genus *Prunum*.\n\nWe employed X-radiography to obtain quantitative measurements of shell morphology across various *Prunum* species.  These measurements were then incorporated into the CerioShell software program, allowing us to construct hypothetical shell morphologies and explore the boundaries of potential morphological variation within the genus.  The results of these modeling exercises will be integrated with experimental and descriptive studies to gain a deeper understanding of macroevolutionary trends within this group.\n\nThe morphology of a shell can be conceptualized as a three-dimensional structure that evolves through time.  Individual spiral turns, known as whorls, encircle an imaginary central axis called the columella.  The rate at which whorls enlarge can vary, and the line separating each whorl is called the suture. Typically, the largest whorl is the body whorl, while the spire comprises all whorls except the body whorl.\n\nShells are often examined from four primary perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural.  In the \"conventional\" orientation, known as the apertural view, the aperture faces the observer and the apex points upwards.\n\nCounting whorls can be accomplished by first observing the shell from the apical view and identifying the beginning of the first suture. A line drawn through this point divides the shell into two sections, and whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter whorl.\n\nViewing a shell as a series of apertures that unfold through time and space as the animal builds its shell provides a unique perspective.  The path of the aperture can be tracked using the coordinates of the center of each whorl's aperture, along with its horizontal and vertical radius.  This trajectory can be represented graphically and mathematically.\n\nOnce a mathematical model is established, it becomes possible to manipulate parameters and modify the mollusk's skeletogenesis, offering insights into the interplay between form and function in evolutionary processes.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality has plateaued over the past decade. Despite advancements in areas like water and sanitation, which align with the Millennium Development Goals, improvements in child and maternal health haven't kept pace with the targets set for 2015. This deceleration necessitates a deeper examination of the contributing factors, pointing towards the need for systemic health-sector strengthening rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nWhile Indonesia has made strides in increasing births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, reaching 72%, this figure encompasses traditional providers like midwives. These individuals, while valuable, lack the medical expertise to manage complicated pregnancies, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate attributed to hemorrhage. Consequently, this indicator's improvement may be somewhat deceptive, highlighting the persistent need for further progress.\n\nFurthermore, the percentage of under-five children with diarrheal illnesses receiving professional treatment has declined. Though postnatal care data is incomplete, it's evident that this area also requires urgent attention, with low utilization rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean section rates remain below expectations, hovering around 4%. This disparity is further amplified by the stark contrast between urban (7%) and rural (2%) c-section rates, underscoring the inequitable distribution of healthcare services. Access to quality care appears concentrated in urban centers, while rural communities face significant challenges.\n\nThe issue of vertical equity is equally concerning, with a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles. This suggests a substantial barrier to healthcare access for the most vulnerable population, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nAddressing neonatal and maternal care improvements necessitates a fundamental question: Is it more effective to implement program-specific solutions or bolster the overall health system, encompassing pre- and postnatal care for mothers and infants? While targeted programs offer the allure of focused objectives and potentially faster results, several drawbacks warrant consideration.\n\nConcentrating resources on a specific health sector can lead to neglect in other areas, diverting funding and human resources.  The impact of HIV/AIDS funding on the family planning sector serves as a cautionary example. Additionally, parallel programs for a single area often result in duplication of services and uncoordinated efforts, leading to administrative complexities and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is often characterized by meticulous attention to detail and a prominent focus on the aristocratic class of that era. However, two notable novels, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" deviate from this established convention. Both stories incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, setting them apart from their contemporaries. This departure enriches the characters, offering deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities. \n\nOne illustrative example can be found in this passage from \"Oliver Twist\": “And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220) \n\nThese novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and context of these moments vary. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these occurrences often reveal glimpses into Oliver's inner turmoil, his unspoken pain, and his growing awareness of the true nature of his surroundings. The shooting of Oliver, revisited vividly in chapter 28,  takes on a dreamlike quality as he struggles for help. This passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events, and the dire consequences his health has suffered, highlighted by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he remains oblivious to the \"unseen hand\" that carries him away. He relives his despair, detached from the initial shock of pain, experiencing a constant, fear-driven agony.  Oliver's helplessness raises questions about the source of his misfortune, as it's clearly not his own doing. This reinforces the idea that Oliver has little agency, unable to exert any control, even in the face of imminent danger. A growing sense of defeat pervades this scene, suggesting Fagin's influence has broken Oliver's spirit, forcing him to accept his despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it's reasonable to assume Oliver would have made some attempt to save himself.\n\n\nAnother example of this dreamlike state can be seen in \"Wuthering Heights\": “The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work with elementary students in an after-school program. While I was capable of assisting in various subjects, my strongest areas were English and reading.  One particular student, a boy named Adrian, who I believe was in either third or fourth grade, presented a unique challenge. He struggled significantly with reading, displaying peculiar patterns. Some letters he could pronounce flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him. It was quite perplexing. I knew Adrian was of Latino heritage, as he spoke perfect English.\n\nWe encountered difficulties until the day I met his mother. While the rest of the after-school group was on a field trip, Adrian's mother visited.  She didn't speak any English, only Spanish.  Fortunately, despite my limited Spanish skills, we managed to communicate. It was then that a realization struck me: Adrian could read perfectly well, but he wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. \n\nWhile I'm unsure if this realization directly helped him, I sincerely hope he's doing better now.  \n\nSharing this story highlights the issue of the language barrier in our schools, particularly here in California. It demonstrates that challenges aren't always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can present significant obstacles.  This problem is widely recognized, but the question remains: what can we do about it?\n\nFor Adrian, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring focused on English reading, specifically the alphabet and pronunciation. However, the situation is far more complex for children with limited English proficiency. There isn't a single solution. Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutors, and ESL classes, none of these approaches alone can fully address this issue.  The key lies in a multifaceted approach, combining various methods.\n\nThe dual language system is a commendable concept, beneficial not only for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Research indicates that children in two-way bilingual education programs outperform their peers academically.\n\nSome people fear that dual language programs are a waste of resources and that the majority of students won't benefit.  This is a misconception. Implementing these programs as the norm rather than the exception would benefit all children. \n\nBut how do we achieve this?  Requiring all teachers to be bilingual is unrealistic and impractical. However, I believe it's entirely feasible to have bilingual support staff, tutors, or assistants.",
            "From our earliest years, many of us are told about a presence greater than ourselves, something beyond our grasp.  Some seek answers in religious institutions like Sunday schools or temples, while others look inward. Traditions often guide our beliefs, passed down through generations, but some reject them entirely, clinging to the confines of their own limited perspectives. Our values can shift and change throughout life, leading us on a personal quest to define our place in the universe. We yearn for guidance, a beacon of light to illuminate our path and lead us towards understanding.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father murmured, his gaze fixed on the rain drumming against the tin roof of our porch. We sat together, sharing a cigarette as the downpour soaked the plants lining the edge of the steps. He seemed lost in thought, his eyes reflecting a mixture of longing and memory.  His frame had become more fragile, his clothes hanging loosely on his weakened body. His hair, once thick, was now noticeably thinner. He avoided my gaze, staring out into the grayness. I felt a deep sense of isolation and fear, an inability to voice the overwhelming sadness that threatened to consume me. To speak of my impending loss would only amplify the reality, an unbearable truth for us both. I reached out, pulling him into a hug, and then settled back into my chair, drawing closer to his side. Together, we watched the rain cascade down on the twilight world.\n\nThat December, just five days after my twenty-second birthday, my father died. The treatments had prolonged his suffering, but ultimately failed to ease his pain. He lingered beyond the doctors' predictions, trapped in a cycle of agony.  The purpose of this extended struggle remained a mystery to me. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I  whispered into the emptiness of the night, my prayers unanswered. It seemed as if any connection to a higher power had long since been severed.\n\nI couldn't bear to witness his final moments, the transition from life to whatever lay beyond.  Watching him fade away felt too painful, too final. I chose to remember him by the life he had lived, not by the way he died. I knew him better than anyone else, better than his family, and I was certain he wouldn't have wanted me to be a passive observer at his deathbed. I retreated into the safety of my bed, curling into a tight ball, waiting for the inevitable news.\n\nSilence. No one even bothered to call.",
            "The Gothic novel, as Ian Watt notes in \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel,\" presents a fascinating paradox: it's both \"old\" and \"new.\" This genre has been subject to a range of critical responses, from dismissal to praise, with accusations of shallowness countered by admiration for its exploration of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" often considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, ingeniously blended elements of both ancient and modern romances, forging a new literary expression. Walpole strategically employed theatrical conventions from the past, alongside a modern, more naturalistic approach, to create what he termed \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4).\n\nThe genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic architecture, theatre, and traditions, even though the term \"Gothic\" itself carried connotations of archaism and lack of sophistication in comparison to the perceived advancements of the contemporary era. The marriage of these theatrical elements with the novel's innovative format, allowing readers a more intimate understanding of characters' inner lives, contributes to the Gothic's enduring appeal. Despite its historical roots, it continues to resonate with readers across time, simultaneously feeling both outdated and refreshingly novel.\n\nOne prominent theme in Gothic literature is chivalry, a concept deeply rooted in the medieval period. The training and ideals of knighthood are both preserved and transformed in \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Gothic writers were particularly drawn to chivalry because it represented an idealized archetype: the brave, honorable, and competent knight. This ideal, they often perceived, had been lost in the complexities of contemporary society. Through the exploration of chivalric values and manners, the \"Gothic past\" is romanticized and idealized, foreshadowing the genre's future evolution into Romanticism. This nostalgic lens serves as a commentary on the present, suggesting a longing for a simpler, more virtuous age.\n\nWalpole, writing during a politically tumultuous period, was deeply concerned about the future. Facing personal challenges and accusations, he might have subconsciously yearned for the perceived moral clarity and inherent goodness of the \"Gothic past.\" This sentiment is evident in several characters, notably Frederic. Even before his introduction, Frederic is presented as embodying chivalric traits:\n\n[Insert description of Frederic here]\n\nThis description is heavy with traditional chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has suffered tragedy and is believed to have been killed by enemies, embodies the exaggerated image of the \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" a trope that would become quintessential to Gothic literature (66).",
            "Supply chain management is the intricate network of activities involved in moving goods from the moment a customer places an order through the entire journey, encompassing raw materials, supply procurement, production, and finally, product delivery to the customer.  The term itself, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, encapsulates the overarching strategy of planning, implementing, and monitoring these interconnected processes to ensure customer needs are met efficiently and promptly.\n\nOliver's framework identifies six crucial elements that form the backbone of any effective supply chain: production, sourcing, inventory management, location strategy, transportation, and information flow. Business leaders leverage these elements to optimize customer service and satisfaction.\n\nProduction, the initial stage in this chain, lays the groundwork for the entire operation. It involves meticulously defining when, where, and how goods will be manufactured, taking into account customer demand.  Understanding market trends and analyzing consumer preferences are vital for managers to determine product specifications and production volumes.  \n\nOnce these key decisions are made, the focus shifts to selecting the optimal production location, considering factors like capacity, quality standards, and proximity to both suppliers and customers.  Efficient scheduling of work, alongside meticulous equipment maintenance, are crucial for ensuring smooth and uninterrupted production.  The production stage demands meticulous attention to detail, as any oversight can have significant financial and time-related repercussions.  Companies like Walmart and Target exemplify this by implementing detailed procedures and guidelines for every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments, thereby minimizing confusion and maximizing operational efficiency.\n\nThe second critical element, supply, involves strategic decisions regarding facility capabilities and outsourcing partnerships.  A single product may have multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, workforce, and specialized expertise.  Managers must carefully assess which division is best suited for each stage of the production process.  Outsourcing certain tasks to external companies can also be a strategic choice.

            "A curious scene unfolds on a bustling city street. Actress Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" stands alone, holding a cardboard sign aloft. The message, penned in bold black marker, reads \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" This cryptic statement, while seemingly outlandish, hints at a deeper concern. \n\nBurma, officially known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation grappling with a complex political reality. Since 1962, the country has been governed by a military junta, a powerful group that seized control through a coup.  In 2007, a wave of public protests, the first in a decade, swept through the streets. These demonstrations, known as the \"Saffron Revolution,\" were spearheaded by Buddhist monks, their saffron robes a symbol of both their faith and their defiance. \n\nInitially, the government tolerated the peaceful gatherings, but the situation quickly escalated. What began as calls for reform transformed into a violent clash between the monks and the military. Monasteries were raided, foreign journalists were detained, and the world watched in horror as the situation spiraled out of control. The death toll, officially reported as 13, is disputed by some, with allegations of a much higher number of casualties.\n\nBurma's story is not unique. Throughout history, governments have sought to suppress dissent and maintain absolute power. From the Roman emperors claiming divine authority to the current political landscape, the struggle between those in power and those seeking change is a recurring theme.\n\nExamples of this power struggle are etched in history. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 saw students, workers, and intellectuals calling for greater freedoms in China. The exact number of casualties remains shrouded in controversy, with official figures starkly different from independent estimates. The Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu extremists systematically targeted Tutsis and political moderates, serves as a chilling reminder of the brutality that can erupt when ethnic tensions are exploited for political gain. And of course, the horrors of the Holocaust, where the Nazi regime systematically persecuted and murdered millions of Jews, stands as a testament to the dangers of unchecked hatred and intolerance.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring influence on jazz music can be largely attributed to his remarkable longevity and, consequently, his exceptional talent in molding his orchestra. While his piano presence might be understated in many of the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shines through in his ability to craft intricate and sophisticated pieces that allowed each band member to showcase their individual strengths.  \n\nEllington masterfully created a framework where soloists could freely improvise, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically highlighted the unique styles of his musicians, thus enriching the overall musical tapestry. This meticulous attention to detail resulted in cohesive and original soundscapes that perfectly complemented each piece. Ellington's profound understanding of each player's individual sound, as well as their collective synergy within the ever-evolving ensemble, enabled him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and awe-inspiring compositions in jazz history. \n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative approach, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his use of voice as a \"jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early work demonstrates Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrics. Furthermore, \"Creole Love Call\" exemplifies Ellington's ability to complement the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his extensive discography. This slow, deliberate twelve-bar blues composition, comprising six distinct choruses, unfolds as follows:\n\n* **Chorus 1:**  A call and response exchange between the vocal and reed sections, where the voice begins with a smooth, melodic tone, gradually transitioning to a rougher, more expressive quality towards the end.\n* **Chorus 2:** A muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes, adding a layer of depth and melancholy.\n\n* **Chorus 3:** A sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano phrase, creating a sense of soaring beauty and intricate interplay. \n\n* **Chorus 4:** The full band echoes the first chorus, with a call and response between the brass and reed sections, intensifying the musical conversation. \n* **Chorus 5:** The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call and response in a high register, supported by a syncopated stop time rhythm from the brass and rhythm sections, building to a powerful crescendo.\n* **Chorus 6:** A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call and response between the voice and reeds. In this iteration, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, showcasing its full instrumental potential as a solo voice. \n\nA brief tag concludes the piece with a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone, leaving a lasting impression.\n\nEllington's innovative use of voice to add a unique tonal dimension to this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that consistently permeates his work.  In \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington seamlessly blends his skill in tight orchestration with his discerning ear for tonal color. A call and response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously utilizes the vocal elements of Miley's playing and the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, creating a rich and complementary sound.  \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands upon these ideas, as Ellington masterfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a prominent member of his orchestra, to introduce the melody on muted trombone, showcasing his ability to extract unique and unexpected sonic qualities from his musicians.",
            "Throughout her life, a persistent yearning had lingered within her. It was a craving that remained unfulfilled, a void she couldn't quite define.  This feeling first emerged when she was fourteen, on the cusp of adolescence, and continued unabated three years later at the age of seventeen. By then, she'd realized her desire wasn't for material possessions, but for companionship – a connection with another person.  However, she found herself unmoved by the attentions of boys who sought her out. They'd make clumsy attempts to win her affection, but none sparked any real interest. This perplexing lack of romantic interest led her to question herself relentlessly, trying to decipher the underlying cause of this unusual experience. Years of introspection had yielded various theories, but none felt substantial enough to warrant serious consideration. So, she carried on with her life, perpetually grappling with this enigmatic longing.\n\nHer typical days were marked by tranquility. Her parents were kind, composed individuals who rarely, if ever, clashed. Arguments with their daughter were equally infrequent. The only disagreements arose when she asserted her independence and free-spirited nature.  Though she was the daughter of a serene couple, her vibrant and engaging personality often contrasted with their calmness, making her a beloved and likable presence.\n\nToday, however, tranquility was absent. As she wandered from room to room, searching for inspiration, a piercing scream from the kitchen shattered the peace. It was her mother's voice, filled with distress. She rushed into the room, panic rising within her as she cried out, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" Her mother lay on the floor, grimacing in pain, uttering short, pained gasps.  Her daughter rushed to her side, placing a hand on her mother's arm in an attempt to offer comfort. \"Ouch...sweetheart, I...need you to take me to the hospital,\" her mother managed, her words clipped and strained. Her daughter sensed the severity of her mother's condition. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mother gestured with her hands, and in that moment, the daughter felt immense gratitude for the strength-training classes she had taken.  She carefully lifted her mother and carried her to the car, gently laying her down in the backseat, and then drove towards the hospital.\n\nThe sterile scent of disinfectant and the air thick with the aura of sickness and apprehension hung heavy in the hospital. But her daughter's focus remained solely on her mother. She swiftly wheeled her inside and called for medical assistance. Concerned faces gathered around, and someone quickly retrieved a gurney and laid her mother on it.  She was whisked away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious anticipation.\n\nLater, she learned that her mother had fallen from a step stool while trying to reach a vase from the top shelf of a cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern resembling the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet), measured by a specific scoring system called the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and death from stroke. The aMed diet, a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet, emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, and legumes, while prioritizing monounsaturated fats over saturated fats.  Fish consumption is encouraged, and animal products and saturated fats are limited. Moderate alcohol intake is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a link between following a Mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of overall mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these earlier studies did not specifically examine the connection between the Mediterranean diet and stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis study followed a large group of 74,886 women, ranging in age from 38 to 63, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term observational study involving 121,700 female nurses across eleven US states. These women had no history of CVD or diabetes at the start of the study.  \n\nOver a period of 20 years, from 1984 to 2004, researchers assessed the participants' adherence to the aMed diet using detailed questionnaires about their food intake over the previous year. These questionnaires, known as \"food frequency questionnaires\" (FFQs), underwent rigorous validation studies to ensure accuracy.\n\nInformation about CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke events was collected through medical records, hospital records, autopsies, and death certificates. When complete medical documentation was unavailable, cases were classified as \"probable\" and included in the analysis, representing approximately 17% of all stroke cases and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarctions.  \n\nTo account for other factors that could influence the results, researchers collected data on each participant's body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and use of hormone therapy. Starting in 1986, information about their physical activity levels was also gathered.\n\nTo minimize the impact of random variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated cumulative average aMed scores based on the repeated FFQs, combining scores from the two preceding years. Statistical adjustments were made to control for potential \"confounding\" factors such as age, smoking, body mass index, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nA statistical technique called Cox proportional-hazard modeling was used to examine the relationship between the aMed diet score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were created for fatal and nonfatal cases of both CHD and stroke.\n\nThe findings revealed a clear association: higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as indicated by a higher aMed score, was linked to a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in these women.  Over the 20-year follow-up period, there were 2391 new cases of CHD, 1763 new cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined). Women in the highest aMed quintile (meaning they adhered most closely to the diet) had a 29% lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The U.S. economy faced a severe downturn in 2007, characterized by rising unemployment, a collapsing housing market, and widespread financial distress among major corporations. This economic instability continues to cast a long shadow, prompting us to examine its origins and potential solutions. At its core, the crisis stemmed from a combination of imprudent political decisions and flawed financial practices.  \n\nPressure from policymakers encouraged banks and financial institutions to extend subprime loans, fueling an already fragile financial infrastructure.  Government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were also incentivized to package these mortgages into complex securities known as CDOs and CDSs. When borrowers defaulted, a ripple effect ensued, leaving banks with inadequate capital reserves and spreading the crisis throughout the financial system.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s during the Clinton administration. The President, seeking re-election, prioritized policies aimed at increasing his popularity, including relaxing lending standards. This, as noted by Steven Holmes of The New York Times in 1999, created a vulnerable environment for the housing market. Holmes observed that Fannie Mae, under pressure from both the Clinton administration and its shareholders, was aggressively expanding mortgage lending to lower and moderate-income borrowers. He prophetically warned of potential consequences, drawing parallels to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. \n\nThe crisis was further exacerbated by the emergence of new and intricate mortgage products, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and CDOs.  These complex instruments intertwined the housing market with other sectors of the economy, leading to excessive leverage among U.S. households and financial institutions.  When the housing bubble burst, the financial institutions holding these mortgage-backed securities faced catastrophic losses.\n\nThe crisis had a devastating impact on the financial landscape. Top U.S. investment banks reported a staggering $4.1 trillion in mortgage-related debt in 2007, representing approximately 30% of the nation's GDP.  Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at deeply discounted prices, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to transform into commercial banks subject to stricter regulations. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, burdened with $5 trillion in mortgage debt, were placed under government control in September 2008.",
            "Exposition. It's the part of the story where a writer attempts to weave intricate prose, captivating the reader's attention. Or, it can be the section where readers lose interest, their eyes glazing over as they long for the narrative to progress. Even seasoned authors like Dr. Merlin have been known to express frustration when faced with excessive exposition.\n\nThe key principle to remember is \"Show, don't tell.\"  Despite this, even experienced writers can fall into the trap of long, descriptive passages that lack action or momentum.  Exposition, in its purest form, is the act of directly conveying information to the reader, often in a straightforward manner. Think of a film scene where one character delivers a lengthy monologue, dumping a torrent of details on their counterpart.  In written fiction, this responsibility falls on the author.\n\nLet's consider an example. Imagine a story where the heroine's romantic history is laid out in stark detail: how she met her husband, their grand wedding, and his tragic murder.  While this information is crucial to the plot, delivering it in a two-page exposition would be jarring. Instead, the author should focus on showcasing the husband's character through his interactions and dialogue, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions.  Similarly, the heroine's personality should be illuminated through her reactions to her husband, demonstrating how his presence shaped her life.\n\nBy immersing the reader in these emotional nuances, the author can create a deeper connection to the husband's fate and, consequently, to the heroine's grief. The reader should feel the weight of his loss alongside the heroine, amplifying the emotional impact of the story.\n\nIn essence, the author must go beyond the mere outline of events and provide depth and substance to the narrative. It's tempting to rush through character development, but investing time in crafting a compelling backstory can significantly enhance the overall reading experience. For instance, a new character with a past in the Air Force, now working as a gas station night manager, might seem like a simple archetype.  However, delving into his motivations, dreams, and personal struggles can transform him into a multi-dimensional character that resonates with the reader.",
            "My television viewing this morning included two local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio. The first, a live broadcast from NBC 4 on August 13, 2011, led with a story about a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed. The report, which lasted approximately two minutes, indicated that the victim had sustained multiple stab wounds and that Hostettler had been apprehended. I felt the amount of time dedicated to this story was appropriate given its developing nature.\n\nThe second segment focused on a shooting that occurred earlier that morning in the Sharon Woods area, involving an 18-year-old male named Travis Buyers. Buyers sustained critical injuries, and at the time of the broadcast, no arrests had been made. The SWAT Team was actively investigating the crime. I perceived this story as relatively brief, and I wondered if this brevity might be attributed to the victim's race. It's a concerning observation I've made over time: when minority individuals are victims of crime, media coverage often appears to be more limited compared to instances involving white individuals.  \n\nSubsequent segments covered a gunshot hole discovered in a Med-Flight helicopter,  a weather forecast predicting rain and thunderstorms for the weekend, and a robbery at a UDF store on Clime Road. The robbery story involved a description of the suspect, a black male, emphasizing his race and complexion, which I found somewhat unusual. \n\nFinally, the broadcast featured a story about Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas, who had been found guilty of conspiring to distribute large quantities of marijuana to Ohio.  The report mentioned his 300-month sentence, which I found interesting, as opposed to simply stating 25 years.",
            "The relationship between brothers is unique, characterized by an unbreakable connection that transcends the ordinary. This bond encompasses a spectrum of emotions, including love, pride, jealousy, and even cruelty. Brothers possess an innate understanding of each other, a depth of comprehension unmatched by any other relationship.  They see themselves reflected in their brother's eyes, not as others perceive them, but as their true selves. It is during moments of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond comes to light, revealing its inherent strength, for better or for worse.  The intensity of these emotions often carries significant consequences.  Comprehending the emotions that arise from this fraternal link necessitates confronting the repercussions they bring.  When one can look into the eyes of a brother and see a mirror image of oneself, they see not a constructed facade, but an authentic reflection.  It is within their actions and the outcomes of those actions that their true character is revealed.\n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" delves into this theme, exploring the complex and often conflicting emotions that define the bond between brothers. Set against a backdrop of lush and vividly rendered landscapes, two brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile.  The narrative culminates in a clash between bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive the ordeal. This central theme is conveyed through a combination of direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator's perspective, which provides insight into the protagonist's internal world and his perception of his surroundings, both of which significantly influence his behavior.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are driven by a singular, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial outings together to their final, fateful endeavor, the protagonist harbors resentment towards Doodle.  He yearned for a brother who could share his experiences and accomplishments, a companion who could engage in activities such as \"holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp...\"  He envisioned a brother with whom he could share adventures, \"someone to race to Horsehead Landing...and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn...\"  However, Doodle's physical limitations, born from a weak heart that made survival a constant challenge, shattered these hopes. The protagonist, consumed by ambitious dreams, struggled to reconcile his aspirations with his brother's reality.\n\nHis anger towards Doodle is palpable as he recounts considering infanticide, contemplating suffocating the child. This disturbing thought reveals the depth of his frustration.  Yet, a simple smile from Doodle triggers a shift in his feelings, softening his resolve. This suggests that his initial thoughts were not firmly rooted in malice but rather a manifestation of his disillusionment.  Deep down, the protagonist possessed an instinctive love for his brother.",
            "The human mind is a complex system designed for handling and generating information.  As our understanding of technology progressed from basic to advanced, the ways we've likened the brain to machines also evolved. Initially, comparisons were drawn to simple tools like wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, later shifting to more sophisticated analogies like books and, most recently, computers. However, it's crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful, have their limitations and can sometimes lead to inaccurate conclusions about the brain's true nature.\n\nThe process of information management begins with input from our senses. These organs transform physical stimuli – things like touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrical and chemical signals. The brain then refines this raw data through a series of intricate algorithms, employing both bottom-up and top-down processing. Imagine looking at a black square against a white background. Bottom-up processing helps us break down the image into its fundamental elements: color, shape, and edges. This allows us to recognize the distinct form of the square. Top-down processing, on the other hand, leverages prior knowledge and expectations to accelerate this recognition. In this case, it might help us instantly identify the object as a box rather than simply a collection of shapes.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain level, a specialized filter determines its significance and directs it to the appropriate cognitive functions. For example, while our brains constantly process visual data from our surroundings, our attention filter prevents us from consciously registering every blade of grass we see while walking. Conversely, it allows us to focus on our name even amidst a bustling crowd. This filtering process occurs at multiple stages, continually shaping the information we experience.\n\nFor the brain to function effectively, information must be stored. There are various types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. Initially, information is encoded, with different encoding methods depending on the type of stimulus. For instance, spoken words can be encoded structurally (based on their appearance), phonemically (based on their sound), or semantically (based on their meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical signal circulating through a specific set of neurons. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is thought to be maintained through the physical structure of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models attempt to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. Some are based on how humans recall memories, while others draw inspiration from computer science or neurophysiology. The semantic network model proposes that concepts are represented as interconnected nodes, with links representing their relationships. For example, in this model, \"chair\" might be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, *Brave New World*, the author paints a chilling portrait of a future where technology and capitalism intertwine to create a society that prioritizes manufactured happiness and societal conformity above individual expression and genuine connection. The novel explores the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its symbiotic relationship with a capitalist system that subtly manipulates and controls its citizens.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, Huxley's critique becomes even more apparent. The concept of \"homogeny,\" the suppression of individuality and diversity, and \"reification,\" the objectification of human beings as mere cogs in a machine, resonate throughout the novel. The citizens of *Brave New World* are conditioned from birth to embrace a singular ideology, their desires and aspirations carefully curated by the World Controller, who embodies the power of a dominant class.\n\nHuxley satirizes capitalism through the Marxist concept of \"false consciousness,\" where the working class, or in this case, the lower castes (Delta, Gamma, etc.), are kept unaware of the true power dynamics at play. Their focus is diverted towards immediate gratification and consumerism, fueled by the constant bombardment of advertisements and the promise of instant pleasure. This manufactured contentment serves to pacify the masses and maintain the status quo, much like the Marxist notion of \"ideological control\" over the proletariat.\n\nThe novel further illustrates the concept of \"hegemony,\" where a dominant class maintains control over the rest of society through subtle and pervasive means. The World Controller, representing the elite Alpha and Beta castes, manipulates the system to ensure his own power and perpetuate the cycle of oppression. The lower classes, blissfully unaware of their true position within the social hierarchy, \"buy into\" the ideology that supports this structure, ultimately becoming complicit in their own subjugation.\n\nThe absence of meaningful relationships in *Brave New World* further highlights Huxley's critique of a hyper-capitalist society.  Characters lack depth and individuality, reduced to mere stereotypes that reinforce the homogenized nature of their world.  Love, genuine emotion, and authentic connection are absent, replaced by superficial interactions driven by fleeting pleasures and physical desires. The emphasis on superficiality and material possessions underscores the dehumanizing effects of a society consumed by consumerism and the pursuit of instant gratification.\n\nUltimately, *Brave New World* serves as a cautionary tale, warning us of the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its entanglement with a system that prioritizes profit over human well-being. Huxley's masterful use of satire and dystopian imagery compels us to examine the societal structures that shape our lives and to question the true cost of progress.",
            "My experience as a student at University Park spans approximately two and a half years, which translates to four and a half semesters of learning and growth. One recurring challenge for many, including myself, is navigating the sprawling campus. During my initial year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the furthest point eastward, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center. Journeys from my home in Stuart Hall to classes held in locations like Willard Building, closer to the campus core, often took upwards of 25 minutes on foot, particularly when inclement weather, a frequent occurrence in State College, hampered my progress.\n\nConversations with an alumnus, not significantly older than myself, revealed that the East Halls dorms were once isolated from the main university area by vast expanses of unused land. Today, that landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation. Sports fields, imposing new structures such as the recently constructed Creamery and health services buildings, and apartment complexes now occupy the space, effectively shrinking the distance between areas. As our campus continues to expand, the ease of traversing its vastness becomes increasingly problematic. \n\nWhat, then, is the most effective solution to this mobility quandary? On a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer. However, relying solely on bicycles is insufficient. Student engagement and campus design must be attuned to the needs of cyclists.\n\nRecently, I engaged in a discussion with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a multi-year hiatus. He expressed surprise at his own enjoyment, stating that, \"Bikes are fantastic; for a period, cycling wasn't considered trendy, but it's truly the most efficient mode of transportation.\"  Beyond its physical benefits, bicycling offers unparalleled efficiency in travel. A modest breakfast of oatmeal coupled with a moderate amount of exertion can propel one over 30 miles.  Like many undergraduates, I now reside off campus, a distance from the campus center comparable to some dormitories.  The most astute decision I made this year was acquiring a bicycle.  Daily commutes to Thomas Building, a location at least 25 minutes away on foot from my residence, have been significantly reduced to a mere 5 minutes when I apply sufficient pedal power.\n\nHowever, Pollock Road, the most direct route from my home to Thomas Building, presents challenges for both pedestrians and cyclists. While walking has its merits, my busy schedule leaves little room for extended walks. In the absence of my bicycle, walking would be my only reliable means of reaching my classes.  The daily trek to Thomas Building alone would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, translating to over two and a half hours each week.  Adding to this the time required for traveling to and from other classes, appointments, and various obligations, the cumulative time commitment would be unsustainable."
