            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Driven by a deep-seated desire to make a difference in the lives of vulnerable children, I aspire to pursue a career within the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to provide essential support to children who have experienced abuse or neglect, while also offering guidance and assistance to families facing challenges. I believe the values that I embody – service, respect, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships – are fundamental not only to the field of social work but also to my personal life.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I've been drawn to helping others. Witnessing individuals struggling with adversity, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, solidified my desire to make a positive impact. My undergraduate studies in Psychology provided me with a foundation for understanding human behavior, but it was a specific encounter that truly ignited my passion for social work.\n\nOne summer, I met a young man who had sought refuge with a friend, fleeing an abusive home environment. This experience sparked a profound realization about the urgent need for support services for children in crisis. When I learned of his subsequent call to the authorities, I reached out to his parents, hoping to offer assistance.  Through a conversation with them, I became acutely aware of the complexities of family dynamics and the challenges faced by those seeking help. This experience solidified my commitment to pursuing a career where I could directly advocate for children and families in need.\n\nSocial justice is another core value that resonates deeply with me. While society often emphasizes the importance of the individual, we often fall short of truly embracing uniqueness. The pursuit of conformity can stifle individual expression and perpetuate social inequities. Throughout my time in high school and college, I actively challenged societal norms and stood up against injustice in various ways, from expressing myself through unconventional fashion choices to participating in advocacy groups and speaking out against discrimination. I believe in fostering a society that values individual expression and ensures equal opportunities for all. My commitment to social justice will undoubtedly guide my work as a social worker.",
            "This paper explores the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in understanding the complexities of insomnia. The biological perspective delves into the role of inherited genetic predispositions and physical health conditions in sleep disruption. Conversely, sociocultural models examine the influence of environmental factors, considering variables such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic standing, and social relationships. This review critically analyzes existing research on insomnia, aiming to shed light on how these distinct models contribute to our comprehension of the disorder.\n\nSleep disorders can be broadly categorized into three main types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders arising from medical or substance-related issues. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias, characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, and Parasomnias, involving unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep. Within Dyssomnias, we find conditions like insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias.  Sleep disorders linked to mental health often stem from conditions classified under Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or intellectual disabilities) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, with some broader considerations of primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the influence of genetics, inherited traits, and physiological mechanisms. For instance, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles. Research involving mice has revealed the presence of specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which are directly involved in sleep-wake regulation. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and sleepiness. Studies utilizing a GABAB agonist (baclofen) have demonstrated an increase in sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). While animal models cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, these findings suggest a potential genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Variations or malfunctions in this receptor could potentially impact sleep quality, potentially requiring medication for adequate sleep. From a sociocultural perspective, if these genetic predispositions are inherited, they might influence an individual's sleep patterns. Consequently, alterations in the GABAB receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively affecting various aspects of life, including academic performance, career success, and daily activities that require sustained attention and focus.",
            "This document examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  Firstly, it defines the disorder concisely. Next, it explores the diagnostic process, outlining common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the document concludes by outlining strategies a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can employ to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD),  refers to how effectively the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  A precise definition, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), is that it involves the perceptual processing of auditory input within the CNS, including the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing and gives rise to electrophysiological auditory responses. In essence, CAPD presents as a difficulty in the brain's ability to properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" The issue stems from the brain's inability to effectively translate sounds, distinguishing words or separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest documented instances of what would become known as CAPD surfaced in the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Researchers at the time were studying children with communicative disorders.  An Italian research team, consisting of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing assessments for these children in 1954.  In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiological basis of CNS function in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 significantly stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in diverse ways. An individual might struggle to localize or perceive sounds spatially, have difficulty distinguishing between two or more auditory events, or recognize sound patterns. They may also have trouble differentiating changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm based on vocal inflection.  One sound might be masked by a subsequent sound, and they might struggle to synthesize auditory cues, interpreting them in a meaningful way to guide their actions. Additionally, they might have difficulty determining the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists. These professionals utilize a variety of measures to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and direct observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli.  Currently, no single test or tool consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many assessments present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to those signals.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a powerful tool for deception, its prolonged use risks erasing one's true identity. The act of revealing a concealed persona, however, often leads to social isolation.  Individuals may find themselves caught between the need for self-preservation and the desire to maintain relationships. While some might react with indifference to the unraveling of a deception, others are likely to feel deeply hurt and offended.\n\nThe play delves particularly into the challenges of gender deception, raising crucial questions about the motivations behind such a choice. Why would someone choose to abandon their own identity and assume the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, her disguise serves as a form of self-protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola finds it necessary to present herself as a man to safeguard herself from potential harm. Her strategy proves successful but isolates her from the female community, severing her access to a vital support system.  Furthermore, her convincing performance leads to a misunderstanding, as Olivia mistakenly believes her to be Sebastian and develops romantic feelings: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). This adds another layer of complexity to Viola's situation, as she must navigate suppressed romantic desires from Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261).\n\nDespite its potentially progressive elements, \"Twelfth Night\" might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can bring suppressed emotions to the surface, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that are triggered by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario purely based on his perceived masculinity, or does it reveal a deeper, unacknowledged longing? While this interpretation is debatable, Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia suggests a critique of those who judge individuals solely based on appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from romantic interest in Cesario to Sebastian, and her subsequent acceptance of Cesario/Viola as a familial figure: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "The legacy of German colonial rule is marked by instances of brutality, particularly the devastating genocide perpetrated against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, reducing the complexities of an entire colonial empire to such a singular act would be an oversimplification.  \n\nThe German colonial enterprise exhibited a wide spectrum of policies and governing styles, mirroring the diverse geographical landscapes it encompassed. Educational initiatives across the colonies followed a similar pattern of variation. When British forces assumed control of German East Africa (now known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable population of educated and literate Africans. Contemporary accounts also lauded German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other territories. \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast.  Unlike East Africa, where the government established state-run schools and actively engaged in the education of the local population, South West Africa's responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies, receiving only nominal government support. The German administration, however, made substantial investments in the education of European colonists, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial financial and regulatory backing to missionary institutions. These divergent educational policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, extending even beyond the period of German rule.  While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of educated and literate Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by educational advancements, with the \"overwhelming majority\" of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate.\n\nA confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark disparity in educational outcomes. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, giving particular attention to recent research exploring the attitudes of colonial authorities and European settlers towards the native African population.\n\nA substantial body of literature addresses the subject of education within the German colonial empire. The majority of these sources are in German and were produced during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies illuminated significant variations in the educational systems of different colonies.  The most prominent work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study on education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies, examining the factors contributing to their disparities. He posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although much of the territory was characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The realm of popular music has witnessed an explosion of genres over the past century, making a comprehensive list a daunting task. This complexity is further amplified by the proliferation of subgenres within each established category, from rap and rock to country, jazz, and folk, to name just a few. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as a particularly dynamic and expressive force in popular music over the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its wide emotional range, often gravitating towards darker themes.  \n\nHeavy metal's diversity is equally notable. From its early days, musicians recognized its inherent flexibility, leading to the creation of distinct subgenres, which in turn spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, continuing to evolve to the present day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal landscape is characterized by a vast array of niche groups, blurring the lines of what constitutes \"heavy metal\" itself.  Despite its expansive reach and incorporation of influences from other genres, heavy metal undeniably originated from a specific source. To truly understand the diverse metal music prevalent today, one must delve into the origins of the heavy metal movement and its significance as a cultural phenomenon rather than merely a musical genre.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality.  It eschews primitiveness in favor of technical proficiency, with musicians demonstrating exceptional instrumental skill. Furthermore, heavy metal is intrinsically linked to the influence of drugs. The psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s spurred experimentation and creativity, resulting in unconventional and otherworldly musical expressions. The use of drugs became a recurring motif in the movement, often serving as a catalyst for its raw and visceral qualities.\n\nHeavy metal's dark and visceral nature stood in stark contrast to the prevailing musical trends of the time, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the human experience.  Subsequent generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the same dark, emotional depths explored by Romantic Era artists. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this inherent darkness.  The song, with its fluctuating dynamics, arguably depicting the effects of drug use, is considered by some to be a precursor to heavy metal. It served as a response to the Rolling Stones' foray into heavier and darker sounds, demonstrating the Beatles' willingness to explore similar territory.",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealism, a painter named Henri Rousseau was meticulously constructing his own artistic dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" transcends the depiction of a woman awestruck by a dream landscape; it embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the outset of his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and the acclaim of fellow artists and art enthusiasts. This desire presented him with a significant internal conflict: to conform to prevailing painting styles in order to gain approval from the art world he admired, or to forge his own path, embracing creative independence and uniqueness.  \"The Dream\" stands as the most poignant expression of Rousseau's lifelong struggle between conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully comprehend the layers of meaning within \"The Dream,\" one must first delve into Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in Laval, France, in 1844, Rousseau's upbringing lacked formal artistic training.  He spent his early years working as a toll collector for the French government, earning him the nickname \"douanier,\" despite the discrepancy from his actual profession. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the deaths of eight infants, left Rousseau with profound grief and a daughter named Julia. Painting became a refuge, a means of solace and a fresh start. Unlike contemporary artists who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the aspirations and dreams of the ordinary individual.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for acceptance within the art world can be attributed to his circumstances. He began his artistic journey later in life, without formal training, amidst a thriving scene of talented and established modern artists.  Despite years of dedicated work, recognition eluded him until a time when Matisse was already gaining prominence. Jan Gordon, in her book \"Modern French Painters,\" highlights the distinct differences between these two artists, noting that while they shared the competitive landscape of the art world, their motivations diverged significantly.  According to Gordon, \"Matisse was driven by a fear of painting conventionally, while Rousseau's ambition was to create such a conventional painting that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "The intertwining of ethics and aesthetics has long fascinated thinkers who recognize a deep-seated connection between truth and beauty. This bond, I believe, stems from a fundamental truth about human experience. As John Keats eloquently expresses in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge is acquired through formal education or lived experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional pathways. \n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics, in essence, strive to illuminate rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to decipher the reasons behind the captivating nature of a piece of art or literature, or the ethical implications of an action, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating such works. \n\nFurthermore, any attempt to fully capture the essence of what is considered good or beautiful through critical analysis proves ultimately inadequate. For example, discussions surrounding the merits of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" may delve into technical aspects like composition, color, and historical context, yet these elements fail to fully explain its enduring appeal. When asked about a cherished work of art or literature, individuals often preface their explanations with a phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" hinting at an intangible quality that defies precise articulation. \n\nI contend that both art and morality possess an inherent element that transcends mere description. As Flannery O'Connor aptly states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how meticulously we analyze the characteristics of a literary work, a certain profound essence remains elusive. I believe ethics shares this same quality. Wittgenstein's assertion, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental,\" resonates deeply with this notion. \n\nIt is this \"something,\" this ineffable quality, that constitutes the most captivating attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that binds them together.  \n\nThe profound impact of morality and art stems from our experience of them on a more fundamental, noumenal level, as Kant would term it. They resonate with us in a way that transcends rational explanation. This connection is particularly evident in literature, as McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Contemporary Germany is widely recognized as a powerful and unified nation, boasting a distinct cultural identity that permeates its diverse landscape. From the Bavarian Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, a shared cultural thread binds the nation. This cultural tapestry is evident in Köln, situated on the banks of the Rhine River, and extends to the heart of Germany and the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe. Given this rich and multifaceted heritage, it is not surprising that modern Germany's origins can be traced back to a confluence of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania, a term shrouded in historical debate regarding its etymology.  Tacitus, a prominent Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who, prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls, were known as Germans (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often with seemingly ambiguous motives (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Caesar adopted the term from the Gauls themselves.  \n\nWhile the precise origin remains uncertain, some scholars suggest it originated as a neighboring term in the Gaulish language.  In the first chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). \n\nOther theories propose that the name stems from the spear, known as a \"ger\" in Old English (O.E.D, 2010), which was commonly used in Germanic warfare, or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which alludes to the Germans' reputation for boisterousness (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" which explored the origins of the Germans, stated, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nRome, in its pursuit of expansion, sent expeditions into Germania for trade and occasional military campaigns. However, the Romans largely avoided permanent settlement in Germania, preferring to concentrate on their vast empire.  As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century CE, they inhabited the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods acquired from their land and contributing their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "My gaze was fixed downward, my mind struggling to process the scene before me. I observed it with a detached neutrality, a practiced awareness that dissected the image without allowing it to connect with any deeper understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, ephemeral and fleeting. My mind worked with such precision and fluidity that it felt as though I had ceased to think, replaced by a purely sensory experience of what lay before me.\n\nEarlier, encouraged by an artist I had worked with, I had purchased a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  A desire to draw had been with me since childhood, and this book promised to teach everything from the fundamentals of using a pencil to the intricate ways the brain interprets lines. One technique it advocated was to frame any subject with an imaginary square, simplifying an intricate scene, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a more manageable composition, essentially focusing on the bowl of fruit alone. \n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl, I couldn't summon the mental frame the artist had described. I was overwhelmed, captivated by its sheer presence. Picasso had his blue period, Monet his admiration for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes. If I dared to dream of a style of my own, a perspective worthy of the label \"Artistic,\" then this was it, the genesis of my visual narrative, the dawn of \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingertips touched the chosen instrument of my artistic endeavor, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, translating my thoughts into form in what could have been the most creative act of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and pure. Particles detached from the whole, carried away into nothingness. Muscles tensed and spasmed, a touch more frantically this time, as my hand slammed against the toilet handle. The offending brown mass refused to budge, stubbornly clinging to the bottom of the bowl.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet shoulder-width apart, the green tie constricting uncomfortably around my neck, I furrowed my brow slightly as I surveyed the unappetizing collection of processed organic matter someone had left as a message for those unfortunate enough to clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of forced tranquility, then my hand reached for the wall beside me, grasped the end of the toilet paper roll, and began a ritualistic wrapping, transforming it into a grotesque, oven mitt-like appendage. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand descended slowly into the bowl, mimicking the actions of a parent preparing a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "The issue of teen driving fatalities presents a serious challenge, and it stems from a confluence of factors. Research indicates that the adolescent brain is not fully developed, lacking the maturity necessary to navigate the complexities of driving. Inexperience further compounds this vulnerability, leading to increased rates of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and road departure incidents.\n\nMoreover, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly amplifies the risk. Studies, such as those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, have demonstrated a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the likelihood of traffic accidents involving teenage drivers.\n\nIn response, some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing programs that restrict driving hours and passenger limitations for young drivers. However, these measures are, in my view, temporary solutions addressing only the symptoms, not the root cause. The fundamental issue lies in the statistical reality that young drivers, as a group, are demonstrably less capable of handling the inherent risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nExpert consensus, such as that of psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that even the age of 18 may be premature for full driving privileges. Zuckerman's research highlights the heightened inclination among individuals under 20 to engage in risk-taking behaviors for the sheer thrill of it. Therefore, delaying driving privileges until this tendency diminishes would seem prudent. \n\nContinued issuance of licenses to young teenagers will inevitably result in a surge in accidents and fatalities, particularly with the impending influx of new teen drivers from the \"Millennial\" generation. \n\nA straightforward legislative approach could address this issue effectively. Driver's education programs in schools could continue to provide foundational knowledge, but actual driving would be prohibited until age 18. Provisional permits could be granted prior to full licensing, contingent upon completion of a specified number of practical driving hours, potentially aligned with existing state requirements such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven the widespread nature of these statistics, uniform national legislation on this matter would be a logical and impactful step toward safeguarding young lives across the country.  This proposed approach is not a novel concept; it draws upon existing best practices and aims to mitigate a significant public safety concern.",
            "When exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to examine all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily rely on innovative editing techniques to create optical illusions. My analysis centered on describing the stylistic conventions prevalent in most of these trick films and identifying the distinctive evolutionary traits present in a few later examples. \n\nGenerally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a single set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary within this proscenium, without panning or following moving figures or objects. This compositional approach, common in early cinema, emerged from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic acts. One consequence of this stage-bound setting is that characters in trick films typically move laterally, restricted to side-to-side motion within the frame. They do not progress towards or away from the camera.  Consider, for instance, \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side of the screen and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even when exiting the frame, the camera does not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also influences the shot composition, favoring long shots and occasionally medium shots. Close-up shots are absent from all of the trick films in the Edison catalog. This mirrors the theatrical and vaudeville conventions where the entire performance was visible to the audience at any given moment, framed by the stage boundaries.  As actors rarely move towards the camera, close-up shots are not employed.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot corresponds to a film. This convention limits the average length of trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which primarily focus on short, vaudeville-inspired tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storylines. It's important to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot, as perceived by the viewer, may actually involve several individual shots seamlessly joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Examining \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films, reveals this technique. A closer look exposes the precise moment when the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film appearing as a single continuous shot to the audience.",
            "A prominent figure in the early Republican movement, John Taylor of Caroline, was deeply committed to the ideals of individual liberty and limited government. His background in agriculture and brief foray into politics shaped his worldview, solidifying his convictions on these matters. Taylor's belief in the inherent superiority of an agrarian society formed the cornerstone of his political philosophy, influencing his stances on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw a unique opportunity for the United States to establish an exemplary system of governance. He argued that the absence of entrenched traditions allowed for the creation of a truly self-governing nation. A staunch advocate for natural rights, Taylor believed these rights were interconnected and interdependent; the violation of one jeopardized the integrity of all. He contended that these fundamental rights should be shielded from government encroachment. \n\nTaylor argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" often favored those with physical strength and cunning, leading to an unequal distribution of power. He believed civilization should strive to rectify this imbalance.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the dualistic nature of human beings, encompassing both inherent goodness and potential for evil. He held firm to his convictions on this binary morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that protected private property rights, fostered agricultural prosperity, and discouraged excessive commercialization. Taylor believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would inevitably be influenced by self-interest.\n\nWhile acknowledging that self-interest was a fundamental human motivator, Taylor viewed it as morally reprehensible only when it transgressed the boundaries of a society dedicated to the common good, leading to the exploitation of others. He believed a strong government was essential to contain this inherent human vice, but cautioned against the potential for its own corruption.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly defined within its text. He feared that an expansive federal government would be prone to despotism and financial extravagance. However, he also cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, arguing that it risked misrepresenting the intent of the framers and potentially leading to corruption. Taylor placed greater significance on the Declaration of Independence, viewing it as the true embodiment of the nation's founding principles, as it more clearly articulated the concept of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This downturn was somewhat concerning, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. \n\nThe onset of winter at our New England campus likely contributed to the decrease, as commuting by bicycle or foot naturally diminishes during colder months.  December, coinciding with the end of the fall semester, also saw students and faculty preoccupied with academic demands and holiday preparations.  The importance of logging commutes may have simply slipped the minds of many during this busy period. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which campus attendance significantly decreases.  The low log submissions in January could be attributed to the post-break period, as routines are re-established. However, the low submissions for February remain unexplained.\n\nIt is possible that the project, like many initiatives, experienced an initial surge of enthusiasm that gradually waned. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign aimed at revitalizing participation. This effort was successful in increasing log submissions for that month.\n\nA key challenge encountered was maintaining project momentum amidst natural fluctuations in engagement, compounded by specific factors inherent to higher education, such as semester breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother obstacle faced by this project, and indeed any initiative promoting alternative commuting, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for individual car use. To encourage participation, a variety of incentives were offered, including gift certificates to local businesses and national retailers.  Exploring the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or electric cars, could have potentially boosted engagement, particularly during periods of decline. The value of prizes remained consistent throughout the project.  However, a strategy of progressively increasing prize value, perhaps announcing bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, might have further motivated participation.",
            "Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific market index, commodity, or a collection of assets.  Similar to index funds, ETFs offer diversification, but with the added flexibility of trading on stock exchanges like individual shares. This means investors can engage in strategies like short selling, margin buying, and purchasing fractional shares.\n\nWhile ETFs boast lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds, they do come with a trading commission, mirroring the cost structure of stock transactions.  The vast selection of ETFs available further enhances their appeal.\n\nHowever, it's crucial for discerning investors to critically assess the advertised benefits, such as diversification, and determine their actual extent.  To illustrate this, we'll analyze the ETF IHF and compare its performance to its top 10 holdings, which represent a significant portion of its assets. Our objective is to ascertain whether simply owning the ETF provides comparable advantages to holding a diversified portfolio of these individual stocks. We'll also explore if alternative stock combinations within this group could yield a more favorable risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nTo simplify our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. These holdings are listed below, along with their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how accurately these ten stocks represent the overall performance of ETF IHF, we can leverage the current asset percentages.  These percentages, normalized to 100%, will be used to calculate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions held by the ETF. The calculated Beta and Return values for each stock are presented in the following chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings generates a 6.11% higher return than the ETF itself, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings could potentially deliver a higher return with lower risk. However, it's important to determine if these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we'll analyze the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare its cumulative impact to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his most accomplished poems.  Within this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines six and fifty-six, a word that literary scholar Mabbott traces back to the writings of Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island situated north of Britain, a place perceived by the ancient Greeks as the furthest reaches of the known world. While Virgil's usage is well documented, it's essential to acknowledge another, more contemporary source that likely influenced Poe. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nA key point of interest arises from this connection to German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's and Goethe's respective poems, suggesting that Poe may have been inspired by Goethe's work.  The \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a renowned writer whose poetic drama \"Faust\" achieved widespread acclaim. This masterpiece was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second, during Goethe's final year, in 1832.  Nestled within the second part of \"Faust\" is a poignant short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This piece centers on a king whose grief-stricken state follows the death of his wife, who had gifted him a goblet. Consumed by sorrow, he drowns his pain in alcohol, haunted by memories of his deceased queen.  He ultimately decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children, except for the goblet.  He then walks to a cliff, tosses the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and takes his own life.  The demeanor of the \"King of Thulé\" and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, potentially reflecting Poe's own personal struggles and reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism.\n\nInterestingly, \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a year preceding Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Notably, Poe employs \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works. While he uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem like a bookend.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker paints a vivid picture of the desolate landscape of Thulé, describing it as dark, lonely, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with the themes of loss, sorrow, and despair that permeate \"The King of Thulé\" after Goethe's wife's passing.  The entire poem can be seen as a journey into the heart of Goethe's own emotional turmoil.\n\nGoethe's significance in the literary world would have made him a figure of great interest to Poe, especially considering Poe's admiration for Tennyson.  It is well-documented that Poe held Tennyson in high esteem.  Beyond this connection to Tennyson, Poe would have undoubtedly encountered Goethe's works through numerous reprints and adaptations circulating at the time.",
            "The question of whether punitive damages are warranted in a slip-and-fall case, specifically involving an applesauce spill in a California grocery store, presents a compelling legal issue. \n\nA judge would likely hesitate to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To successfully argue for such an award, Palmer must demonstrate that store manager Paul Martin acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm his actions could cause. She must also establish that Martin's conduct was particularly reprehensible.\n\nPalmer's argument hinges on the fact that Martin was informed of the spill twice, choosing to delay cleanup while on his dinner break.  She will likely assert that Martin should have been aware of the foreseeable danger posed by the spill, citing previous instances of customer slip-and-fall accidents at the store. While the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less strong, it is still supported by the number of similar incidents that occurred in 2009, suggesting a pattern of negligence.\n\nThe events leading up to Palmer's fall on October 13, 2009, paint a concerning picture. At 5:00 pm, employee Rich Wayne notified Martin of the spill but was met with the dismissal that Martin was unavailable during his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin to the same hazard, receiving a similar response. Tragically, at 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and sustained a serious back injury.  \n\nThis incident followed five other slip-and-fall accidents reported at D&D Markets in 2009, raising questions about the store's safety practices. Palmer's lawsuit against D&D seeks both compensatory and punitive damages. The legal team is currently evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded in cases where a defendant's conduct involved \"oppression, fraud or malice,\" even in the absence of a contractual obligation.  The statute defines malice as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct demonstrating a willful disregard for the safety and rights of others.",
            "During my studies at CBC, I delved into the complexities of Islam, engaging in thought-provoking discussions about its nature and perceptions.  The question of whether Islam is inherently hostile remains particularly pertinent in today's world. Observing the media landscape since 9/11, I've witnessed a dramatic shift in portrayals of Islam, transitioning from a predominantly negative perspective to one that veers towards excessive tolerance. This evolution is exemplified by the emergence of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose Muslim heritage sparked neither controversy nor widespread criticism.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad presents intriguing contradictions. My prior understanding, shaped by historical accounts, led me to believe that Muhammad was a forceful converter, conquering tribes and imposing Islam upon them. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and even self-effacing.  People, it suggests, gradually embraced his teachings after witnessing his humility and wisdom.\n\nFurthermore, I noticed striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the attributed \"miracles\" of Muhammad. One instance that particularly caught my attention was the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who relied on truth and divine intervention rather than seeking external validation. However, this approach, while seemingly innocuous, can inadvertently diminish the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles. It creates a sense of artistic borrowing, potentially undermining the unique identity of Jesus's message.\n\nSeveral accounts in the biography rely on third-party testimonies, raising concerns about their reliability.  The stories often involve a chain of narrators, each relaying information passed down from someone else. While the intention may be to provide corroboration, this reliance on hearsay weakens the stories' credibility and introduces an element of doubt.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. This idealized portrayal clashes with historical accounts that depict a different side to Muhammad's character.  I wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the complexities and contradictions surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought following Jesus' lifetime presents a fascinating case study. While his original teachings undoubtedly served as a foundation, subsequent developments have led to a divergence from those early beliefs.  \n\nThe modern world, characterized by its progressive inclinations, seems to be driving this shift further. Although traditional viewpoints persist, their influence may not be substantial enough to halt this trajectory. A growing awareness of history within the Christian community suggests a yearning to discern the authentic core of Jesus' message from the doctrines that have accumulated over time. \n\nThis could result in a significant historical reversal, a gradual return to Jesus' original teachings. Imagine a movement gaining momentum, meticulously peeling back layers of accumulated doctrine, as if time itself were in reverse, until only the essence of Jesus' initial message remains.  \n\nThis trend, when it reaches its peak in the United States and Europe, might lead to a resurgence of practices closer to Jesus' era, with a unified approach to faith.  This shift could also see a reduction in the diversity that currently characterizes Christendom, with greater similarities emerging across denominations and regions. \n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals. The Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to adopter of Christianity is one striking instance. Similarly, the United States has witnessed a remarkable evolution from a period of African-American slavery to one marked by African-American leadership.  \n\nThis impending reversal in the Christian landscape will likely involve a re-interpretation of Jesus' words, viewing them metaphorically rather than literally.\n\nLooking back in time, we see that Judaism, the precursor to Christianity, held the core theological tenets of monotheism, divinely revealed scriptures, and their authority.  The Jewish population in Roman times was not monolithic, encompassing various groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "Upton Sinclair's novel, \"The Jungle,\" delves into the inherent flaws within humanity, exposing a society where self-interest reigns supreme. The pursuit of personal gain overshadows any sense of compassion or concern for those less fortunate. This theme is starkly illustrated through the portrayal of factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit above all else.\n\nSinclair vividly depicts the industrial landscape, emphasizing the stark contrast between the imposing factories and the desolate environment they inhabit. The \"line of buildings\" stands \"clear-cut and black\" against the sky, while the \"great chimneys\" spew out \"a river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery underscores the disregard for the surrounding ecosystem and the well-being of those who live in its shadow.\n\nThe callous indifference of the owners extends to their workforce. Driven by an insatiable hunger for wealth, they exploit their employees, forcing them into grueling work conditions and subjecting them to arbitrary layoffs without any form of support. Sinclair's words paint a bleak picture of a system where individuals are reduced to mere cogs in a machine, their lives deemed expendable in the relentless pursuit of profit.\n\nHe highlights the absence of regulations and the powerlessness of the workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. Even the unions, intended to provide a voice for the laborers, become corrupted, exacerbating the plight of the already vulnerable. The workers are left with no recourse, their lives consumed by the harsh realities of Packingtown, a place where they are likened to \"slaves,\" subject to the whims of their brutal and unscrupulous masters.",
            "Authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding crucial themes.  The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of these strategies in his novel, *The Great Gatsby*.  He frequently juxtaposes adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to create a particular aura surrounding certain subjects. Additionally, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them for the same evocative purpose. Fitzgerald exemplifies this latter technique through his use of color symbolism, particularly gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.  \n\nWithin *The Great Gatsby*, Fitzgerald constructs nuanced meanings associated with color, notably white/gray and red/pink, which he later employs to elicit specific feelings in relation to significant objects. \n\nThe author establishes a connection between white/gray and uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated class while gray connotes age and faded grandeur. Fitzgerald introduces this semantic framework early in the narrative through consistent depictions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually adorned in white (8), and this sartorial preference extends to other characters: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instances where characters deviate from this white attire occur when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies the meanings associated with these colors by applying them to commonplace objects and settings. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's party guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is depicted as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a visual representation of uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary individuals and places as white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child (26) by the railroad, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs.\n\nAfter establishing a rich tapestry of meaning associated with white/gray, Fitzgerald strategically employs these colors to symbolize unimportance or conformity in relation to particular subjects. This technique is first evident in Daisy's portrayal. Following a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them when describing Daisy dressed in \"white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), subtly suggesting a shift in her characterization from a complex individual to a more uniform object of desire, something Gatsby yearns for. Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy's reduced individuality through subsequent descriptions, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant, sunny weather. The region is known for a variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a considerable demand for organic, locally-sourced produce in the San Diego area, with numerous community-supported agriculture programs experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and dairy products are also highly sought after.  Many organic farms offer visitors an opportunity to engage with their operations through tours and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation presents a unique opportunity for landowners to simultaneously benefit from government programs that support sustainable agriculture while enhancing local biodiversity and offering educational programs and recreational experiences, potentially generating additional income.\n\nBeyond its economic potential, organic farming offers several ecological advantages.  By eschewing synthetic chemicals, organic practices promote greater biodiversity among both plants and animals.  However, it's important to acknowledge that organic farming often comes with increased costs.  Labor-intensive methods are required for pest and weed management, as well as soil fertilization without the use of chemical inputs.  Furthermore, organic farming typically experiences higher crop losses compared to conventional methods.  Small-scale organic farms may also face challenges in achieving the same economies of scale as larger operations.  Similarly, practices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also demand more manpower, including activities such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or open patches.  These factors highlight the complexities faced by landowners seeking to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe specific parcel of land under consideration is located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  Spanning 160 acres, it encompasses a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest.  This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This comprehensive plan, currently under review, aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Other species are declining and are at risk of becoming endangered, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis region has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land, historically part of an original homestead patent, likely served as grazing land and/or a source of wood for many decades.  \n\nIn this scenario, a property was selected from a real estate website, and available government programs were researched to determine what options a small-scale farmer might realistically pursue to mitigate costs while preserving a wildlife-friendly agricultural operation.  To illustrate a potential model for success, a nearby organic farm was identified.",
            "The influence of cultural context is undeniably significant in any negotiation. Culture, more than a singular entity, is defined by its complexities and nuances, encompassing both its explicit and implicit aspects. Recognizing that cultures are not monolithic or uniform is crucial, dispelling generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" as overly simplistic and inaccurate. While acknowledging general cultural trends can be helpful, a negotiator benefits greatly from a deeper understanding of how a particular culture's values and perspectives will shape the negotiation process.  \n\nWhen encountering a new culture, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own, leading to insights and potential misunderstandings.  Comprehending a foreign culture involves a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical perspectives, societal norms, and even potential biases. Rather than imposing judgments or attempting to alter a culture, a respectful approach involves acceptance and adaptability. This is particularly important in negotiations, especially when a negotiator holds a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territory can significantly facilitate overcoming cultural barriers and fostering progress.\n\nCulture extends beyond national boundaries, manifesting itself within organizations as well. Companies often cultivate distinct corporate cultures, influencing aspects like work hours, dress codes, communication styles, and even charitable practices.  Observing these variations, such as contrasting work environments in American companies, highlights the diversity of thought that exists even within a single society. Cultures may appear more homogeneous from an outsider's perspective, but this often masks deeper complexities waiting to be explored.\n\nValues are paramount in understanding a culture, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers. For example, a culture that prioritizes \"saving face\" or communal harmony will likely influence negotiation strategies, discouraging public confrontations or actions that might bring shame upon individuals or organizations. Conversely, a culture that values assertiveness and a competitive spirit might approach negotiations with a more aggressive stance.\n\nWhile understanding cultural trends is valuable, it's equally important to gather insights into individual negotiators. Building rapport and understanding personal motivations can significantly enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originating in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This sentiment appears to resonate with another significant figure in our discussion, Thomas Aquinas.  As both theologians grapple with the same fundamental concept – the existence of God – our task is to determine the strength of their respective arguments. For the sake of clarity and brevity, let's assume, for now, that both Anselm and Aquinas are correct in their belief in the God described within the Bible.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison, as their arguments are specifically tailored to this particular understanding.\n\nDespite their compelling points, neither theologian, in my view, offers a fully comprehensive basis for belief in God. \n\nTo illustrate this, let's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection. He posits that because God exists within our comprehension, the very notion of his non-existence is inherently flawed. While his language may be dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the evidence for God's existence lies within our own minds. Anselm suggests that we needn't seek external validation; the truth about God is accessible through introspection and the examination of what we inherently know to be true. This reliance on internal knowledge, lacking demonstrable empirical proof, aligns with the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn stark contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas champions a purely rational and empirical approach to proving God's existence, rejecting the need for faith. This perspective holds significant appeal for evangelism, as it could potentially attract new followers without requiring them to embrace something unprovable. Instead, logic would serve as the primary persuasive tool. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the very existence of these phenomena logically necessitates the existence of God.  He uses the analogy of a missing puzzle piece to illustrate his point: even without seeing the missing piece, the incomplete puzzle logically dictates its existence and certain characteristics.",
            "The emergence of an individual who would later be known as Buddha took place in the 5th or 6th century BCE. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, leading to the establishment of Buddhism. This tradition, with Theravada Buddhism being its most orthodox branch, is approximately 2,500 years old.  It has evolved substantially since Buddha's lifetime, evident in diverse practices.  For example, in Sri Lanka, a country deeply rooted in Theravada Buddhism, a yearly water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and lay practitioners participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning any such festivity. These variations extend from outward customs to the core theological principles of the religion.  The Theravada Buddhist community, both in its monastic and lay segments, has undergone doctrinal shifts over time. This transformation can be attributed to a confluence of internal and external factors, both antagonistic and beneficial in nature.\n\nThis discourse will frequently employ specific terminology. The distinction between internal and external forces will be central. An internal force is defined as any influence originating from members of the Buddhasasana, irrespective of their monastic status. Conversely, an external force refers to any influence emanating from individuals outside the Buddhist tradition. A hostile force is any agency seeking to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, is one that neither intends to harm nor assist the Buddhist community, although its actions might inadvertently result in one or the other. These terms will recur throughout the discussion.\n\nInitially, it is crucial to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism—the doctrines that form its core. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially encompasses the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism.  Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential for ending Sansara, the cyclical journey of death and rebirth, which continues endlessly.  Simultaneously, Sansara will cease, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one achieves enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living. For laypeople, there are five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in sexual misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances. Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha—the truth that life is inherently suffering. Second, that attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico throughout the 19th century presents a compelling case study in international rivalry. For a period spanning nearly six decades, from 1836 to 1893, these two nations were locked in a complex dynamic marked by conflict and tension, as detailed by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145).  A pivotal moment in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring significant territory including Texas and the American Southwest.  \n\nNumerous other clashes punctuated this period, finally subsiding in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War I.  The roots of this rivalry stemmed from a confluence of factors, including fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests, as argued by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31). This pattern of border-related rivalry is not unique to the United States and Mexico. As Pletcher (1977) observes,  \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  The geographical proximity of Mexico and Cuba to the United States, coupled with their historical opposition to American influence, distinguishes them from other Latin American nations that have generally enjoyed more amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations, a theme that echoes throughout history. Frahm (2001) highlights this point, stating that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  The rivalry between the United States and Mexico, much like the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union, involved both ideological clashes and competition for perceived core interests. However, in this case, the ideological struggle revolved around religious beliefs rather than political systems. Underlying this distrust was a legacy of animosity inherited from the colonial era, with lingering resentment between the English and Spanish influencing Anglo-Mexican relations. \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 specific disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period of rivalry.  These disputes, primarily territorial in nature, often centered on border raids and frontier skirmishes. Banditry and lawlessness on both sides of the border posed a persistent challenge, requiring increased military presence to maintain order.  \n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico's economic reliance on the United States grew, and ultimately ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the late 19th century (p. 109, 110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, a new illness, one I'd never encountered, drastically altered my life. I was a nurse then, a profession I'd chosen for the stability it promised. As a child, I yearned for security, a longing that resonated through my adolescence.  \"Nursing is a safe bet,\" I was often told, \"Always in demand, always people needing care.\"  While my heart yearned for the worlds of science and journalism, I opted for the reassuring path of nursing.  \n\nLife, however, had other plans. At 46, single, and with limited savings, I found myself unable to work due to this mysterious illness. Fifteen years have passed since then, fifteen years spent relying on Social Security Disability.  Today, I possess little that truly belongs to me.  Each day is a struggle, a constant test of my resilience, chipping away at my sense of security and self-worth. Uncertainty permeates every aspect of my life, yet one truth shines through: without the unwavering support of my family and a few cherished friends, I wouldn't have weathered this storm.  \n\nLife inevitably throws curveballs, both large and small.  There are no guarantees, no matter how diligently we plan. Some challenges are simply too immense to face alone.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that reliance on government programs alone isn't the answer.  They are often burdened and faltering.  Instead, I believe in fostering a renewed sense of community, a willingness to support one another and seek help when needed.  Rather than isolating ourselves, we should be building bridges of compassion and mutual assistance.\n\nConservatives often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that shaped our nation.  Yet, it was not solely individualism that sustained our forefathers during trying times.  It was their shared values of compassion, respect, and resourcefulness that truly propelled them forward.  The pioneers who braved the treacherous journey across the Rockies did not succeed in isolation; they relied on the strength of their collective spirit.\n\nPreparation is crucial, and I, too, am prepared. I have a disaster kit stocked with first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows against potential threats.  Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods are readily available.  If you have the means, consider self-sufficiency through gardening or preserving food. A wood stove can be invaluable, as long as your living arrangements permit.\n\nBut amidst these preparations, remember the importance of connection.  Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and create a network of support.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the ways they do has long intrigued scientists.  Are there inherent limitations or guiding forces that shape the trajectory of evolutionary change?\n\nDespite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" recent advancements in mathematical modeling have illuminated certain aspects of mollusk skeletal development, both in terms of growth patterns (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research delves into the potential of mathematical modeling, used in conjunction with experimental studies, to unravel the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change.\n\nWe employed X-radiographic imaging of Prunum species to identify quantifiable characteristics of their shells. These parameters were then incorporated into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to construct models of both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. By simulating various shell forms, we aim to define the boundaries of possible morphological transformations within the Prunum lineage. These modeling results are being integrated with ongoing experimental and descriptive analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the macroevolutionary processes shaping this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that traverses a three-dimensional space over time. The revolutions or turns of the coiled shell are termed whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line, the suture, separates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one (the body whorl), while the spire encompasses all whorls except the last. The apex represents the tip of the spire, and its opposite end is referred to as the base. The aperture is the opening through which the animal protrudes from its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex directed upwards.\n\nCounting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the point where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter whorl if necessary.\n\nConsidering a shell as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal builds its shell, we can trace the path of the aperture by plotting the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to investigate the potential for altering the mollusk's skeletal development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates has stagnated over the past decade.  While the nation is on course to achieve several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health fall short of the necessary pace to meet the 2015 target.  The factors behind these shortcomings will be explored, highlighting the need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nSignificant strides have been made in ensuring skilled birth attendants are present for deliveries, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion. However, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners, like midwives, who lack the capacity to manage complications during pregnancy, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate attributed to hemorrhage.  Therefore, while this indicator shows improvement, it masks underlying challenges and demands further attention.  Furthermore, the percentage of childhood diarrhea cases treated by healthcare professionals under the age of five has declined, raising concerns.  \n\nData regarding postnatal care remains incomplete, but it is evident that this area requires urgent improvement due to low utilization rates nationwide.  Cesarean section rates remain below expected levels, hovering around 4%. This disparity in Cesarean section rates, with 7% in urban areas compared to 2% in rural regions, underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services.  Access to healthcare appears concentrated in urban centers, highlighting a need for greater geographic equity.  Moreover, there is a significant 27% gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest quintiles, indicating that the poor disproportionately face barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMoving forward, enhancing neonatal and maternal care indicators necessitates addressing the fundamental issue of service availability.  The question arises: should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or focus on strengthening the overall health system without concentrating solely on pre- and postnatal care?  While program-based solutions appear attractive due to their targeted nature, manageable objectives, and potential for quicker results, they are not without drawbacks.  \n\nConcentrating resources on a single area of the health sector can lead to neglect in other areas, diverting human resources and funding.  The impact of international funding on HIV/AIDS and its subsequent effect on family planning programs serves as a cautionary example.  Furthermore, implementing multiple parallel programs can result in service duplication and a lack of coordination, leading to administrative burdens and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocratic class of the era. However, two novels often classified as Victorian, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" diverge from this conventional mold. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, characteristics not typically associated with Victorian fiction. This departure strengthens the characters within each narrative, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose of these moments vary between the two. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal hidden aspects of Oliver's inner world, his pain, and his understanding of the reality surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, vividly conveyed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him; his senses are numbed as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, which now manifests as a constant and relentless torment linked with fear rather than surprise. This helplessness raises questions about the agency behind Oliver's misfortune, for it was clearly not his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his destiny, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of a situation, even when his life is in peril. The selection also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and hindering his ability to respond. It is reasonable to assume that, otherwise, Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save himself.\n\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program, providing academic support to elementary school students. While I was comfortable assisting with various subjects, I found my strengths particularly lay in English and reading.  One student, Adrian, a boy I believe was in either third or fourth grade, stood out. He was struggling significantly with reading,  exhibiting a peculiar pattern.  He could pronounce some letters accurately, while others seemed completely foreign to him. This was quite unusual. Adrian was of Latino heritage, as I recall, but he spoke English fluently. We faced challenges until I met his mother.  I was supervising a small group of children while the rest were on a field trip when she arrived.  She didn't speak a word of English, communicating solely in Spanish. My limited Spanish knowledge—I was just beginning to learn—allowed for a basic exchange.  That's when it clicked: Adrian wasn't unable to read; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this realization had a lasting impact on his progress, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the complexities of the language barrier in schools, particularly here in California. It underscores the fact that challenges are not always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English well, reading can present significant obstacles.  It's evident that this issue exists; the question is, what can we do about it?\n\nAdrian's situation had a relatively straightforward solution: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, the needs of children who have limited English proficiency are far more intricate. There's no one-size-fits-all answer.  Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes—none of these approaches, on their own, will fully address the problem. The key lies in a multifaceted approach, combining these strategies effectively.\n\nDual language programs offer a promising solution, not just for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs demonstrate superior academic performance compared to their peers.  Despite this, there's often fear surrounding these programs, with concerns about resource allocation and the lack of benefits for the majority of students. However, these concerns are unfounded. If we were to adopt dual language programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would stand to gain.\n\nThe question arises: should we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unreasonable and impractical.  However, I believe there's no reason we can't have dedicated bilingual aides or tutors to support language acquisition.",
            "From childhood, many of us are instilled with the idea of something grander than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some seek guidance in religious institutions, while others explore within or question its existence altogether.  Traditions often dictate our initial beliefs, but some actively reject them, clinging to the confines of their own limited perspective. Our values shift and evolve, leading us on a personal journey to define our spiritual selves.  We yearn for illumination, a guiding light to navigate the darkness and embrace the light of understanding.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird. We were seated on our porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a steady backdrop to our conversation. The overflowing gutters channeled the downpour, drenching the plants lining the edge of the porch. He gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of introspection and reminiscence.  I noticed how his frame had become more slender, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame.  His hair, once fuller, was now thinner, more sparse than I remembered.  He kept his eyes fixed on the rain, avoiding my gaze.  A profound sense of loneliness, fear, and helplessness washed over me, making it impossible to articulate my impending grief.  \n\nInstead, I reached out and embraced him, settling back into my chair and drawing closer to his side. We sat together, united in our silent contemplation of the falling rain as twilight descended.\n\n\nMy father's life ended in December of that year, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, though prolonging his existence beyond the doctors' expectations, failed to alleviate his suffering. I struggled to comprehend the purpose of extending his pain. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I questioned, alone in the darkness.  Prayer felt pointless, as if any divine presence had long since ceased to hear my pleas.\n\nWitnessing his final moments felt unbearable. I chose not to be present, unable to bear the sight of life's inevitable end. It was my father's essence, his vibrant life, that I wanted to remember, not the fragility of his passing. I knew him better than anyone else, surpassing even his family in my understanding. I was certain he wouldn't desire his only child to be a passive observer at his death. I retreated into the sanctuary of my bed, curling into a ball for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nBut no one contacted me.",
            "The concept of the Gothic novel presents a curious paradox, as literary scholar Ian Watt aptly describes it in his work, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" It's a genre that has been simultaneously criticized and celebrated, dismissed for its perceived lack of depth and lauded for its evocative power, particularly its ability to tap into a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" often recognized as the first Gothic novel, skillfully blends elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to establish a new literary form. Walpole himself utilizes  traditional theatrical conventions alongside a more contemporary focus on the natural world, a technique he labels \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic themes, evident in its theatrical elements, architectural motifs, and cultural references. Even at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto\"'s publication, the term \"Gothic\" had already acquired a wide range of associations, often perceived as antiquated or simplistic in comparison to the perceived advancements of the modern era. However, it is this very juxtaposition—the theatricality of the Gothic combined with the novel's ability to offer a more intimate exploration of character psychology—that has ensured its enduring appeal, allowing it to remain both timeless and strangely contemporary for readers separated from its origins by vast expanses of time.\n\nOne recurring motif in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of knighthood, the rigorous training that shaped a knight, is both preserved and reinterpreted in Walpole's seminal work. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers because it embodied the archetype of the heroic knight: brave, honorable, and competent. This ideal, which many Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, believed had been lost in contemporary society, became a source of longing and a benchmark against which to measure the perceived shortcomings of the present. Through their use of chivalric ideals and conventions, Gothic writers romanticize the \"Gothic past,\" hinting at the genre's future evolution towards Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a way to elevate and potentially improve the present.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of significant political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt a sense of despair about the future.  His writing reflects a yearning for a simpler, more morally upright era, a time when the inherent \"goodness\" of humanity, as exemplified by the chivalric code, was more pronounced. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic. Even before his introduction, the reader is presented with a character imbued with chivalric traits:\n\n [Insert the description of Frederic as provided in the original text here]\n\nThis description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has suffered tragedy and is presumed to have been killed by infidels, embodies many of the classic attributes of the gallant and courteous knight. However, as with many Gothic tropes, this ideal is exaggerated, introducing an element of excess that would become a hallmark of the genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management refers to the intricate network of processes involved in bringing goods from initial customer demand to their final destination. \n\nThis concept, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, emphasizes the importance of planning, executing, and overseeing every stage of the supply chain to ensure customer satisfaction through efficiency and speed.\n\nSix fundamental elements underpin a robust supply chain: production, procurement, inventory management, location strategy, transportation, and information flow.  By skillfully managing these elements, businesses can deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the cornerstone of the supply chain, involves defining the \"who, what, when, and where\" of goods creation. Understanding customer needs is paramount, and analyzing market trends provides valuable insights into demand.  Based on this analysis, managers determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities.  \n\nLocation selection for production is crucial, considering factors like production volume, quality standards, and proximity to customer markets.  Concurrent with this, managers prioritize scheduling production workloads and ensuring equipment maintenance. Production's meticulous planning is essential; any oversight can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nTake, for instance, my experiences at retail giants like Walmart and Target. Both companies meticulously document every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These standardized procedures ensure smooth workflows and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key element, supply, encompasses strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and the selection of outsourcing partners.  \n\nA single product might have multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must strategically allocate production to the most suitable division based on the product's specific requirements. Outsourcing can also be a strategic choice, often driven by the need to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.",
            "A peculiar sign, held aloft by actress Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" draws the eye on a bustling street corner. Scribbled in Sharpie on cardboard, the message reads: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"  This unsettling statement prompts a reflection on the situation in Burma, officially known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation grappling with a long-standing military dictatorship. \n\nThe current regime, which seized power in a coup in 1962, has a history of suppressing dissent. In 2007, a wave of protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" for the saffron robes worn by the leading Buddhist monks, erupted across the country. Initially peaceful, the demonstrations escalated into a violent clash between the monks and the military.  \n\nThe crackdown drew international condemnation. Journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, were detained and, in Nagai's case, tragically killed while covering the unrest.  While the official death toll remains disputed, a defected military officer claimed the true figure to be far higher.\n\nThis tragic episode in Burmese history sadly echoes a recurring theme throughout human history: the struggle against oppressive regimes. From ancient Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to modern-day dictatorships, the desire to control and silence opposition is a persistent challenge to freedom and human rights.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where Chinese citizens gathered to demand political reform, serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of such suppression. Estimates of the casualties vary widely, with official figures vastly lower than those reported by independent sources. Similarly, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, fueled by ethnic hatred and government inaction, resulted in the systematic massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus.  \n\nThe atrocities of Nazi Germany, with its systematic extermination of Jews and other persecuted groups, stand as a chilling testament to the depths of human cruelty and the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz genre is significantly rooted in his prolonged career and, consequently, his remarkable ability to mold his orchestra. While his piano presence might be understated in several of the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his creation of intricate and layered pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his musicians. He meticulously crafted a framework that allowed soloists to freely express themselves while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically catered to the unique styles of individual band members, thereby illuminating musical concepts in a distinctive manner. This approach also served to emphasize the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in cohesive and original soundscapes that perfectly complemented each composition. Ellington's mastery over the individual voices within his ensemble, as well as their collective synergy, empowered him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and masterful works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's innovative sound, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his consistent use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early composition exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrical content. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's aptitude for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work. This gradual, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds over six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between voice and reeds, commencing with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions into a more raspy tone towards its conclusion.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the fundamental melody and accentuates several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo performed in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano interlude.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, engaging in a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by a rhythmic \"stop-time\" backdrop provided by the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this instance, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, assuming the role of a solo instrument.\nTag: A brief concluding section featuring a vocal flourish and a dissonant, unexpected ending delivered by a trombone.\n\nEllington's strategic employment of voice to enrich the tonal palette of this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that pervades his entire oeuvre.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his talent for precise orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color.  A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously merges the vocal qualities of Miley's trumpet playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, resulting in a harmonious and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands upon these concepts, as Ellington skillfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to deliver the melody on muted trombone with remarkable impact.",
            "From a young age, she felt a persistent yearning, a void that seemed impossible to fill. This dissatisfaction first emerged around the time she turned fourteen, during the tumultuous transition into adolescence. Three years later, at seventeen, the feeling remained, now morphing into a desire for companionship rather than material possessions. However, no boys captured her interest. Though some showed interest in her, their attempts at courtship were met with indifference. She often pondered this peculiar phenomenon, trying to unravel the cause of her uncharacteristic apathy towards romance. Years of introspection yielded several theories, but none were convincing enough to warrant serious consideration. Thus, she carried on with her life, perpetually questioning her own desires.\n\nHer family life was typically tranquil. Her parents were amiable and composed individuals, rarely clashing with each other. Disputes with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their only disagreements stemmed from her assertive nature and independent spirit, which often contrasted with their calm demeanor. Though they were a remarkably peaceful pair, she possessed a vibrant and outgoing personality, making her both likable and endearing.\n\nHowever, this day was anything but ordinary. As she wandered through the house, seeking inspiration for her own pursuits, a sudden cry pierced the air. It was her mother's voice, filled with distress, emanating from the kitchen. Her heart pounding, she rushed to the room, her voice laced with concern, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" There she found her mother lying on the floor, writhing in pain, her gasps punctuated by pained groans. Rushing to her side, she gently touched her mother, offering comfort and support. \"Ouch...sweetheart, I...need you to take me to...the hospital,\" her mother's words were strained and fragmented. The urgency in her voice left no room for doubt; she was in excruciating pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the fear threatening to engulf her. Her mother guided her hands, and in that moment, the daughter, a product of her own physical training, felt a surge of gratitude for her strength. She carefully lifted her mother, laid her gently in the backseat of the car, and drove towards the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a sensory overload: the sharp scent of disinfectant mingled with the metallic tang of fear and illness. Yet, her anxiety was overshadowed by her determination to help her mother. She swiftly carried her mother inside, calling for medical assistance. Several worried faces gathered around, a rolling bed was swiftly brought, and her mother was gently laid upon it. They rushed her away for immediate treatment, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious contemplation.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research investigated the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern similar to the Mediterranean diet (referred to as the \"alternate Mediterranean\" or aMed diet) and the risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also encourages moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a connection between following a Mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of both total and cardiovascular mortality. One trial even demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these studies hadn't focused specifically on stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed a group of 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study tracking the health of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. These women had no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers assessed their adherence to the aMed diet using detailed food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) completed six times. These questionnaires were designed to pinpoint the types and amounts of food consumed in the previous year.  Validation studies ensured the accuracy of the FFQs.\n\nInformation about the women's health was obtained through medical records, hospital records, autopsies, and death certificates. Some cases, particularly strokes and nonfatal heart attacks, were classified as \"probable\" based on self-reported information, as complete medical records weren't always available.  The researchers also gathered data on factors like body mass index, smoking habits, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone therapy use. Starting in 1986, they also assessed the women's levels of physical activity.\n\nTo account for variations in individual dietary patterns and better reflect long-term eating habits, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed diet scores from the repeated FFQs. These averages were based on combining scores from the two preceding years. To ensure the findings weren't skewed by other factors (confounders), the researchers adjusted their analysis for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nStatistical models called Cox proportional-hazard models were used to determine the link between the aMed diet score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases.\n\n\nThe study found a clear association between a higher aMed diet score (indicating greater adherence to the Mediterranean-style eating pattern) and a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in these women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the highest aMed quintile (meaning their diet most closely resembled the aMed pattern) had a significantly lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a pivotal moment in American history, witnessing the nation grapple with a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market experienced a dramatic collapse, and numerous prominent corporations faced imminent ruin. The repercussions of this economic downturn continue to be felt today, prompting a crucial inquiry: What factors contributed to this crisis, and how can we prevent its recurrence?\n\nAt the heart of the crisis lay a confluence of political decisions that prioritized short-term gains over long-term stability. These policies, driven by a desire to promote lending and economic expansion, encouraged banks and financial institutions to extend sub-prime loans to borrowers with questionable creditworthiness. This practice, coupled with a financial system that lacked adequate safeguards and oversight, created a volatile environment ripe for disaster.\n\nEnter Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises tasked with facilitating the housing market. Under pressure to expand access to homeownership, they were incentivized to purchase and repackage these sub-prime mortgages into complex financial instruments known as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and Credit Default Swaps (CDSs). This intricate web of interconnected financial products obscured the underlying risks associated with these risky loans.\n\nWhen borrowers began defaulting on their mortgages at an alarming rate, the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse. Banks, burdened with vast amounts of mortgage debt, faced a liquidity crisis. The repercussions rippled through the interconnected financial markets, infecting institutions that had invested in CDOs and CDSs, ultimately leading to a widespread loss of confidence and a crippling credit freeze.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown several years earlier, during the Clinton administration's push for increased homeownership. In an effort to boost his re-election prospects, President Clinton relaxed lending regulations, creating an environment where sub-prime mortgages proliferated.\n\nThis loosening of lending standards, coupled with the intricate and opaque nature of mortgage-backed securities, created a perfect storm that ultimately culminated in the 2007 financial crisis. The consequences were devastating, leaving millions unemployed, homeowners facing foreclosure, and the global economy teetering on the edge of recession.",
            "Exposition. That word can strike fear into the heart of even the most seasoned writer. It's the point in a story where you, the author, can either soar to new heights of literary brilliance or plummet into the abyss of reader boredom.  \n\nThink of it this way: exposition is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's a necessary tool for setting the stage, introducing characters, and establishing the world your story inhabits. On the other hand, it can quickly become a drag if overdone, leaving your readers longing for something, well, more exciting.\n\nYou've probably heard the golden rule of writing: \"Show, don't tell.\" But even seasoned writers can fall into the trap of exposition overload. It's that inner voice whispering, \"Just get the backstory out there so we can get to the good stuff!\" But remember, readers don't just want the bare facts; they want to experience the story alongside your characters.\n\nImagine you're reading a story, and the hero's past is laid out in a long, descriptive paragraph. You learn about his childhood, his loves, his losses, his every waking thought – all in a matter of sentences. It's like being bombarded with information instead of being drawn into the story organically.\n\nInstead, consider weaving those details into the narrative itself. Let the characters reveal themselves through their actions, their dialogue, their interactions with others. Show us the hero's love for his wife through their tender moments together, or hint at his past struggles through his guarded demeanor. Let the readers piece together his story, just as they would in real life.\n\nTake the example of a new character, a former Air Force pilot turned gas station attendant.  Instead of simply stating his facts, show us his military background through subtle clues: a worn dog tag, a slight tremor in his hand, a distant look in his eyes.  Reveal his dreams of owning the gas station through his interactions with the customers, his meticulous care of the pumps, his quiet contemplation during slow nights. \n\nRemember, exposition is a tool, not a crutch. Use it sparingly, strategically, and always with the goal of enriching your story and engaging your readers.",
            "My attention was drawn to a couple of news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first, a live report from NBC 4, covered the unfolding story of a stabbing in Ashley, Ohio. The suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed. While details were limited - something to the effect that the victim, whose name was withheld, had been stabbed multiple times -  the incident was reported with appropriate brevity given its developing nature. \n\nThe following segment focused on a shooting that had occurred earlier that morning in the Sharon Woods area. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, was critically injured, and the investigation was ongoing with no leads or suspects at the time. The SWAT team was reportedly involved.\n\nThis story felt somewhat abbreviated, and a thought occurred to me: could the brevity be linked to the fact that both the victim and the neighborhood were predominantly Black?  I've noticed a pattern in media coverage where crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention compared to those involving white victims.  Kidnappings, missing persons, or violent crimes against white individuals tend to dominate news cycles, while similar incidents affecting minority communities often receive minimal coverage.\n\nThe next story shifted gears to a different type of incident: a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter.  The location of the incident and the suspected caliber of the weapon used (a .22 caliber rifle) were discussed, and Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nA brief weather segment followed, providing a preview of the weekend's predicted thunderstorms and temperatures.\n\nThen, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was reported.  Details about the suspect, described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, were provided, including his height and weight. The emphasis placed on his race and skin tone struck me as unusual.\n\nThe final story of the broadcast covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for his involvement in a marijuana distribution ring operating between Texas and Ohio.  Interestingly, instead of stating the sentence as 25 years, they used the numerical equivalent, \"300 months.\"  The reason for this choice was unclear, but it seemed somewhat noteworthy. Additionally, his Hispanic ethnicity was mentioned, which I found to be somewhat tangential to the main narrative.",
            "The relationship between brothers is complex, woven from an intricate tapestry of emotions.  Love and pride exist side-by-side with jealousy and even cruelty, a unique blend found nowhere else.  Brothers possess an understanding that transcends ordinary bonds, a mirror reflecting their own souls back at them. This profound connection is most vividly revealed in moments of crisis, revealing its inherent duality—capable of both remarkable strength and devastating darkness.  The weight of these emotions, both positive and negative, carries significant consequences. Truly understanding the nature of this fraternal bond means grappling with the repercussions of these feelings. Looking into a brother's eyes is not simply seeing another person; it's gazing into one's own reflection, unfiltered and raw. It's within their actions and the inevitable outcomes of those choices that their fundamental character is laid bare.  \n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\"  explores this intricate theme, delving into the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a backdrop of lush beauty, two young brothers embark on a journey fraught with futility. Their quest culminates in a poignant clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother to bear the weight of survival. The story's exploration of the theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their evolving relationship.  The narrative voice further amplifies this exploration, offering a glimpse into the protagonist's complex emotional landscape and their perception of the world around them—influences that profoundly shape their actions.\n\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial forays into the world together to their final, fateful adventure, resentment simmers beneath the surface of the protagonist's interactions with Doodle.  He yearns for a brother who can be his partner in all endeavors, someone to share his skills and experiences with. He envisions a brother who can keep pace with him, someone to race with, to climb trees, and to explore the hidden corners of their world.  \n\nDoodle's physical limitations shatter these dreams.  Born with a weak heart, Doodle's future seemed precarious at best, his participation in the protagonist's imagined adventures impossible. The blow to the protagonist's dreams was profound, leaving him grappling with anger and even contemplating unthinkable acts against his younger brother.  However, Doodle's innocent smile evokes a flicker of tenderness within the protagonist, revealing a deep-seated affection that undermines his darker impulses. This suggests that the protagonist's initial resentment was perhaps not absolute, overshadowed by a fundamental, albeit suppressed, love for his brother.",
            "The human brain operates as a complex system, dedicated to processing and generating creative outputs.  As technology has progressed, our understanding of the brain has also evolved, reflected in the evolving metaphors used to describe its function. Early comparisons likened the brain to simple storage devices like wax tablets or papyrus scrolls. Later, the analogy shifted to the book, and most recently, the computer.  However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful, have limitations and can sometimes lead to misconceptions about how the brain truly works.\n\nThe journey of information through the brain begins with its reception by our sensory organs. These organs convert external stimuli – sensations like touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrochemical signals.  The brain then processes this sensory information through a series of intricate steps, employing both \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" approaches.  Imagine viewing a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes the fundamental elements: color, shape, and boundaries. By piecing together these basic elements, the brain determines that you are seeing a box.  Top-down processing, on the other hand, utilizes prior knowledge and expectations to expedite this recognition. In this case, your understanding of what a \"box\" is helps you quickly identify the object, distinguishing it from a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain extent, a sophisticated filter, known as attention, determines its significance and directs it towards relevant cognitive processes.  For example, while your brain registers every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, your attention filter prevents you from consciously noticing each one individually.  Conversely, your name, even amidst a bustling environment, will likely capture your attention.  This intricate process of information processing and modulation by attention occurs in multiple stages.\n\nTo function effectively, the brain requires a system for storing information. This involves various types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. The initial stage is encoding, where information is transformed into a format suitable for storage. Different types of sensory input are encoded in distinct ways. For example, verbal information can be encoded structurally (based on its appearance), phonemically (based on its sound), or semantically (based on its meaning). Once information is stored, it must be maintained.  Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical signal circulating through a specific group of neurons.  Long-term memory, on the other hand, is theorized to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models have been proposed to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. These models draw upon insights from human memory recall, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model is the semantic network model, which posits that knowledge is represented as nodes, each representing a concept. These nodes are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, \"Brave New World,\" the author explores the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its close ties to a capitalist system. The novel paints a chilling picture of a society where individualism is sacrificed for the sake of collective harmony, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. \n\nExamining the work through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's deep-seated anxieties about the emerging economic order of his time. Terms like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist thought, resonate throughout the narrative, suggesting that Huxley saw these societal trends as inherently flawed.\n\nHuxley masterfully satirizes capitalism through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" a Marxist idea that describes the manipulation of the working class into accepting their subordinate position. In \"Brave New World,\" the citizens are so preoccupied with their immediate desires, fueled by relentless consumerism, that they remain blind to the true power dynamics at play. The lower castes, Delta and Gamma, for instance, are practically devoid of independent thought, their desires shaped by the insidious power of hypnopædia, a sleep-learning technique used to instill a thirst for consumption. This control is orchestrated by the World Controller, who embodies the oppressive force of the ruling elite.\n\nThe novel vividly portrays \"hegemony,\" a Marxist concept where one social class dominates others, leaving the lower classes unaware of their exploitation. The citizens of \"Brave New World\" unquestioningly embrace the system, \"buying into\" an ideology that perpetuates their own subjugation. The upper classes, though aware of the manipulation, remain complicit, accepting their privileged position without challenge.\n\nThe novel further explores the corrosive effects of capitalism on human relationships.  The characters, even those deemed central to the plot, lack depth and individuality. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the relentless march of technology and capitalism ultimately strips individuals of their free will and capacity for genuine connection. Love and emotional depth are absent; interactions are superficial and driven by materialistic desires. The focus on physical appearance, particularly in the way males regard females, highlights the reductionism inherent in a consumerist society. \n\nThe citizens' unquestioning acceptance of their social hierarchy mirrors Marxist notions of the proletariat, who are falsely reassured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform. Their unwavering obedience to their designated roles within the social structure serves as a stark commentary on the potential dangers of unchecked capitalist systems.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating this campus, like many others, can pose a challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center.  Journeying from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in locations such as Willard building, nestled near the campus core, often took 25 minutes on foot, particularly arduous when confronted with the frequent inclement weather State College is known for.  Through conversations with an alumnus, not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago, the East Halls complex was isolated from the rest of the institution by vast expanses of undeveloped land. Today, this once-empty space has been transformed into a vibrant hub of activity, featuring sports fields, imposing new structures like the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of residential apartments. As our campus continues to expand, traversing its sprawling grounds becomes increasingly intricate. What then, is the most effective solution to this mobility dilemma?  In the context of a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer.\n\nHowever, the bicycle alone cannot single-handedly resolve this issue. Student adoption and a campus infrastructure designed to accommodate cyclists are essential.\n\nRecently, I engaged in a discussion with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a multi-year hiatus. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, stating, \"Bikes are superb; for a while, it wasn't considered fashionable to ride, but it's undeniably the most practical means of getting around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling offers unparalleled efficiency. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a moderate amount of exertion can propel you over 30 miles. Like numerous undergraduates, I now reside off campus, a distance from the campus center comparable to some residence halls. The most astute decision I've made this year was acquiring a bicycle. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, a location at least a 25-minute walk from my home. Cycling significantly reduces this travel time to a mere 5 minutes, provided I maintain a brisk pace. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, the most direct route from my residence to Thomas building, is not always a smooth journey, whether on foot or by bike. While there are merits to walking, my schedule leaves little room for it. Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole reliable option for reaching my classes. Commuting to Thomas on foot daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours each week.  Factor in the time required for walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, and it becomes clear that walking is simply not feasible."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Driven by a deep-seated desire to make a difference in the lives of vulnerable children, I aspire to pursue a career within the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to provide essential support to children who have experienced abuse or neglect, while also offering guidance and assistance to families facing challenges. I believe the values that I embody – service, respect, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships – are fundamental not only to the field of social work but also to my personal life.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I've been drawn to helping others. Witnessing individuals struggling with adversity, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, solidified my desire to make a positive impact. My undergraduate studies in Psychology provided me with a foundation for understanding human behavior, but it was a specific encounter that truly ignited my passion for social work.\n\nOne summer, I met a young man who had sought refuge with a friend, fleeing an abusive home environment. This experience sparked a profound realization about the urgent need for support services for children in crisis. When I learned of his subsequent call to the authorities, I reached out to his parents, hoping to offer assistance.  Through a conversation with them, I became acutely aware of the complexities of family dynamics and the challenges faced by those seeking help. This experience solidified my commitment to pursuing a career where I could directly advocate for children and families in need.\n\nSocial justice is another core value that resonates deeply with me. While society often emphasizes the importance of the individual, we often fall short of truly embracing uniqueness. The pursuit of conformity can stifle individual expression and perpetuate social inequities. Throughout my time in high school and college, I actively challenged societal norms and stood up against injustice in various ways, from expressing myself through unconventional fashion choices to participating in advocacy groups and speaking out against discrimination. I believe in fostering a society that values individual expression and ensures equal opportunities for all. My commitment to social justice will undoubtedly guide my work as a social worker.",
            "This paper explores the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in understanding the complexities of insomnia. The biological perspective delves into the role of inherited genetic predispositions and physical health conditions in sleep disruption. Conversely, sociocultural models examine the influence of environmental factors, considering variables such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic standing, and social relationships. This review critically analyzes existing research on insomnia, aiming to shed light on how these distinct models contribute to our comprehension of the disorder.\n\nSleep disorders can be broadly categorized into three main types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders arising from medical or substance-related issues. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias, characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, and Parasomnias, involving unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep. Within Dyssomnias, we find conditions like insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias.  Sleep disorders linked to mental health often stem from conditions classified under Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or intellectual disabilities) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, with some broader considerations of primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the influence of genetics, inherited traits, and physiological mechanisms. For instance, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles. Research involving mice has revealed the presence of specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which are directly involved in sleep-wake regulation. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and sleepiness. Studies utilizing a GABAB agonist (baclofen) have demonstrated an increase in sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). While animal models cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, these findings suggest a potential genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Variations or malfunctions in this receptor could potentially impact sleep quality, potentially requiring medication for adequate sleep. From a sociocultural perspective, if these genetic predispositions are inherited, they might influence an individual's sleep patterns. Consequently, alterations in the GABAB receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively affecting various aspects of life, including academic performance, career success, and daily activities that require sustained attention and focus.",
            "This document examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  Firstly, it defines the disorder concisely. Next, it explores the diagnostic process, outlining common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the document concludes by outlining strategies a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can employ to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD),  refers to how effectively the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  A precise definition, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), is that it involves the perceptual processing of auditory input within the CNS, including the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing and gives rise to electrophysiological auditory responses. In essence, CAPD presents as a difficulty in the brain's ability to properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" The issue stems from the brain's inability to effectively translate sounds, distinguishing words or separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest documented instances of what would become known as CAPD surfaced in the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Researchers at the time were studying children with communicative disorders.  An Italian research team, consisting of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing assessments for these children in 1954.  In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiological basis of CNS function in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 significantly stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in diverse ways. An individual might struggle to localize or perceive sounds spatially, have difficulty distinguishing between two or more auditory events, or recognize sound patterns. They may also have trouble differentiating changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm based on vocal inflection.  One sound might be masked by a subsequent sound, and they might struggle to synthesize auditory cues, interpreting them in a meaningful way to guide their actions. Additionally, they might have difficulty determining the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists. These professionals utilize a variety of measures to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and direct observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli.  Currently, no single test or tool consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many assessments present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to those signals.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a powerful tool for deception, its prolonged use risks erasing one's true identity. The act of revealing a concealed persona, however, often leads to social isolation.  Individuals may find themselves caught between the need for self-preservation and the desire to maintain relationships. While some might react with indifference to the unraveling of a deception, others are likely to feel deeply hurt and offended.\n\nThe play delves particularly into the challenges of gender deception, raising crucial questions about the motivations behind such a choice. Why would someone choose to abandon their own identity and assume the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, her disguise serves as a form of self-protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola finds it necessary to present herself as a man to safeguard herself from potential harm. Her strategy proves successful but isolates her from the female community, severing her access to a vital support system.  Furthermore, her convincing performance leads to a misunderstanding, as Olivia mistakenly believes her to be Sebastian and develops romantic feelings: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). This adds another layer of complexity to Viola's situation, as she must navigate suppressed romantic desires from Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261).\n\nDespite its potentially progressive elements, \"Twelfth Night\" might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can bring suppressed emotions to the surface, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that are triggered by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario purely based on his perceived masculinity, or does it reveal a deeper, unacknowledged longing? While this interpretation is debatable, Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia suggests a critique of those who judge individuals solely based on appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from romantic interest in Cesario to Sebastian, and her subsequent acceptance of Cesario/Viola as a familial figure: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "The legacy of German colonial rule is marked by instances of brutality, particularly the devastating genocide perpetrated against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, reducing the complexities of an entire colonial empire to such a singular act would be an oversimplification.  \n\nThe German colonial enterprise exhibited a wide spectrum of policies and governing styles, mirroring the diverse geographical landscapes it encompassed. Educational initiatives across the colonies followed a similar pattern of variation. When British forces assumed control of German East Africa (now known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable population of educated and literate Africans. Contemporary accounts also lauded German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other territories. \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast.  Unlike East Africa, where the government established state-run schools and actively engaged in the education of the local population, South West Africa's responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies, receiving only nominal government support. The German administration, however, made substantial investments in the education of European colonists, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial financial and regulatory backing to missionary institutions. These divergent educational policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, extending even beyond the period of German rule.  While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of educated and literate Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by educational advancements, with the \"overwhelming majority\" of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate.\n\nA confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark disparity in educational outcomes. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, giving particular attention to recent research exploring the attitudes of colonial authorities and European settlers towards the native African population.\n\nA substantial body of literature addresses the subject of education within the German colonial empire. The majority of these sources are in German and were produced during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies illuminated significant variations in the educational systems of different colonies.  The most prominent work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study on education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies, examining the factors contributing to their disparities. He posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although much of the territory was characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The realm of popular music has witnessed an explosion of genres over the past century, making a comprehensive list a daunting task. This complexity is further amplified by the proliferation of subgenres within each established category, from rap and rock to country, jazz, and folk, to name just a few. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as a particularly dynamic and expressive force in popular music over the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its wide emotional range, often gravitating towards darker themes.  \n\nHeavy metal's diversity is equally notable. From its early days, musicians recognized its inherent flexibility, leading to the creation of distinct subgenres, which in turn spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, continuing to evolve to the present day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal landscape is characterized by a vast array of niche groups, blurring the lines of what constitutes \"heavy metal\" itself.  Despite its expansive reach and incorporation of influences from other genres, heavy metal undeniably originated from a specific source. To truly understand the diverse metal music prevalent today, one must delve into the origins of the heavy metal movement and its significance as a cultural phenomenon rather than merely a musical genre.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality.  It eschews primitiveness in favor of technical proficiency, with musicians demonstrating exceptional instrumental skill. Furthermore, heavy metal is intrinsically linked to the influence of drugs. The psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s spurred experimentation and creativity, resulting in unconventional and otherworldly musical expressions. The use of drugs became a recurring motif in the movement, often serving as a catalyst for its raw and visceral qualities.\n\nHeavy metal's dark and visceral nature stood in stark contrast to the prevailing musical trends of the time, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the human experience.  Subsequent generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the same dark, emotional depths explored by Romantic Era artists. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this inherent darkness.  The song, with its fluctuating dynamics, arguably depicting the effects of drug use, is considered by some to be a precursor to heavy metal. It served as a response to the Rolling Stones' foray into heavier and darker sounds, demonstrating the Beatles' willingness to explore similar territory.",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealism, a painter named Henri Rousseau was meticulously constructing his own artistic dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" transcends the depiction of a woman awestruck by a dream landscape; it embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the outset of his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and the acclaim of fellow artists and art enthusiasts. This desire presented him with a significant internal conflict: to conform to prevailing painting styles in order to gain approval from the art world he admired, or to forge his own path, embracing creative independence and uniqueness.  \"The Dream\" stands as the most poignant expression of Rousseau's lifelong struggle between conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully comprehend the layers of meaning within \"The Dream,\" one must first delve into Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in Laval, France, in 1844, Rousseau's upbringing lacked formal artistic training.  He spent his early years working as a toll collector for the French government, earning him the nickname \"douanier,\" despite the discrepancy from his actual profession. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the deaths of eight infants, left Rousseau with profound grief and a daughter named Julia. Painting became a refuge, a means of solace and a fresh start. Unlike contemporary artists who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the aspirations and dreams of the ordinary individual.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for acceptance within the art world can be attributed to his circumstances. He began his artistic journey later in life, without formal training, amidst a thriving scene of talented and established modern artists.  Despite years of dedicated work, recognition eluded him until a time when Matisse was already gaining prominence. Jan Gordon, in her book \"Modern French Painters,\" highlights the distinct differences between these two artists, noting that while they shared the competitive landscape of the art world, their motivations diverged significantly.  According to Gordon, \"Matisse was driven by a fear of painting conventionally, while Rousseau's ambition was to create such a conventional painting that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "The intertwining of ethics and aesthetics has long fascinated thinkers who recognize a deep-seated connection between truth and beauty. This bond, I believe, stems from a fundamental truth about human experience. As John Keats eloquently expresses in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge is acquired through formal education or lived experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional pathways. \n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics, in essence, strive to illuminate rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to decipher the reasons behind the captivating nature of a piece of art or literature, or the ethical implications of an action, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating such works. \n\nFurthermore, any attempt to fully capture the essence of what is considered good or beautiful through critical analysis proves ultimately inadequate. For example, discussions surrounding the merits of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" may delve into technical aspects like composition, color, and historical context, yet these elements fail to fully explain its enduring appeal. When asked about a cherished work of art or literature, individuals often preface their explanations with a phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" hinting at an intangible quality that defies precise articulation. \n\nI contend that both art and morality possess an inherent element that transcends mere description. As Flannery O'Connor aptly states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how meticulously we analyze the characteristics of a literary work, a certain profound essence remains elusive. I believe ethics shares this same quality. Wittgenstein's assertion, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental,\" resonates deeply with this notion. \n\nIt is this \"something,\" this ineffable quality, that constitutes the most captivating attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that binds them together.  \n\nThe profound impact of morality and art stems from our experience of them on a more fundamental, noumenal level, as Kant would term it. They resonate with us in a way that transcends rational explanation. This connection is particularly evident in literature, as McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Contemporary Germany is widely recognized as a powerful and unified nation, boasting a distinct cultural identity that permeates its diverse landscape. From the Bavarian Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, a shared cultural thread binds the nation. This cultural tapestry is evident in Köln, situated on the banks of the Rhine River, and extends to the heart of Germany and the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe. Given this rich and multifaceted heritage, it is not surprising that modern Germany's origins can be traced back to a confluence of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania, a term shrouded in historical debate regarding its etymology.  Tacitus, a prominent Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who, prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls, were known as Germans (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often with seemingly ambiguous motives (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Caesar adopted the term from the Gauls themselves.  \n\nWhile the precise origin remains uncertain, some scholars suggest it originated as a neighboring term in the Gaulish language.  In the first chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). \n\nOther theories propose that the name stems from the spear, known as a \"ger\" in Old English (O.E.D, 2010), which was commonly used in Germanic warfare, or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which alludes to the Germans' reputation for boisterousness (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" which explored the origins of the Germans, stated, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nRome, in its pursuit of expansion, sent expeditions into Germania for trade and occasional military campaigns. However, the Romans largely avoided permanent settlement in Germania, preferring to concentrate on their vast empire.  As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century CE, they inhabited the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods acquired from their land and contributing their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "My gaze was fixed downward, my mind struggling to process the scene before me. I observed it with a detached neutrality, a practiced awareness that dissected the image without allowing it to connect with any deeper understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, ephemeral and fleeting. My mind worked with such precision and fluidity that it felt as though I had ceased to think, replaced by a purely sensory experience of what lay before me.\n\nEarlier, encouraged by an artist I had worked with, I had purchased a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  A desire to draw had been with me since childhood, and this book promised to teach everything from the fundamentals of using a pencil to the intricate ways the brain interprets lines. One technique it advocated was to frame any subject with an imaginary square, simplifying an intricate scene, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a more manageable composition, essentially focusing on the bowl of fruit alone. \n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl, I couldn't summon the mental frame the artist had described. I was overwhelmed, captivated by its sheer presence. Picasso had his blue period, Monet his admiration for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes. If I dared to dream of a style of my own, a perspective worthy of the label \"Artistic,\" then this was it, the genesis of my visual narrative, the dawn of \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingertips touched the chosen instrument of my artistic endeavor, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, translating my thoughts into form in what could have been the most creative act of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and pure. Particles detached from the whole, carried away into nothingness. Muscles tensed and spasmed, a touch more frantically this time, as my hand slammed against the toilet handle. The offending brown mass refused to budge, stubbornly clinging to the bottom of the bowl.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet shoulder-width apart, the green tie constricting uncomfortably around my neck, I furrowed my brow slightly as I surveyed the unappetizing collection of processed organic matter someone had left as a message for those unfortunate enough to clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of forced tranquility, then my hand reached for the wall beside me, grasped the end of the toilet paper roll, and began a ritualistic wrapping, transforming it into a grotesque, oven mitt-like appendage. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand descended slowly into the bowl, mimicking the actions of a parent preparing a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "The issue of teen driving fatalities presents a serious challenge, and it stems from a confluence of factors. Research indicates that the adolescent brain is not fully developed, lacking the maturity necessary to navigate the complexities of driving. Inexperience further compounds this vulnerability, leading to increased rates of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and road departure incidents.\n\nMoreover, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly amplifies the risk. Studies, such as those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, have demonstrated a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the likelihood of traffic accidents involving teenage drivers.\n\nIn response, some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing programs that restrict driving hours and passenger limitations for young drivers. However, these measures are, in my view, temporary solutions addressing only the symptoms, not the root cause. The fundamental issue lies in the statistical reality that young drivers, as a group, are demonstrably less capable of handling the inherent risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nExpert consensus, such as that of psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that even the age of 18 may be premature for full driving privileges. Zuckerman's research highlights the heightened inclination among individuals under 20 to engage in risk-taking behaviors for the sheer thrill of it. Therefore, delaying driving privileges until this tendency diminishes would seem prudent. \n\nContinued issuance of licenses to young teenagers will inevitably result in a surge in accidents and fatalities, particularly with the impending influx of new teen drivers from the \"Millennial\" generation. \n\nA straightforward legislative approach could address this issue effectively. Driver's education programs in schools could continue to provide foundational knowledge, but actual driving would be prohibited until age 18. Provisional permits could be granted prior to full licensing, contingent upon completion of a specified number of practical driving hours, potentially aligned with existing state requirements such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven the widespread nature of these statistics, uniform national legislation on this matter would be a logical and impactful step toward safeguarding young lives across the country.  This proposed approach is not a novel concept; it draws upon existing best practices and aims to mitigate a significant public safety concern.",
            "When exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to examine all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily rely on innovative editing techniques to create optical illusions. My analysis centered on describing the stylistic conventions prevalent in most of these trick films and identifying the distinctive evolutionary traits present in a few later examples. \n\nGenerally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a single set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary within this proscenium, without panning or following moving figures or objects. This compositional approach, common in early cinema, emerged from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic acts. One consequence of this stage-bound setting is that characters in trick films typically move laterally, restricted to side-to-side motion within the frame. They do not progress towards or away from the camera.  Consider, for instance, \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side of the screen and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even when exiting the frame, the camera does not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also influences the shot composition, favoring long shots and occasionally medium shots. Close-up shots are absent from all of the trick films in the Edison catalog. This mirrors the theatrical and vaudeville conventions where the entire performance was visible to the audience at any given moment, framed by the stage boundaries.  As actors rarely move towards the camera, close-up shots are not employed.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot corresponds to a film. This convention limits the average length of trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which primarily focus on short, vaudeville-inspired tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storylines. It's important to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot, as perceived by the viewer, may actually involve several individual shots seamlessly joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Examining \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films, reveals this technique. A closer look exposes the precise moment when the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film appearing as a single continuous shot to the audience.",
            "A prominent figure in the early Republican movement, John Taylor of Caroline, was deeply committed to the ideals of individual liberty and limited government. His background in agriculture and brief foray into politics shaped his worldview, solidifying his convictions on these matters. Taylor's belief in the inherent superiority of an agrarian society formed the cornerstone of his political philosophy, influencing his stances on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw a unique opportunity for the United States to establish an exemplary system of governance. He argued that the absence of entrenched traditions allowed for the creation of a truly self-governing nation. A staunch advocate for natural rights, Taylor believed these rights were interconnected and interdependent; the violation of one jeopardized the integrity of all. He contended that these fundamental rights should be shielded from government encroachment. \n\nTaylor argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" often favored those with physical strength and cunning, leading to an unequal distribution of power. He believed civilization should strive to rectify this imbalance.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the dualistic nature of human beings, encompassing both inherent goodness and potential for evil. He held firm to his convictions on this binary morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that protected private property rights, fostered agricultural prosperity, and discouraged excessive commercialization. Taylor believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would inevitably be influenced by self-interest.\n\nWhile acknowledging that self-interest was a fundamental human motivator, Taylor viewed it as morally reprehensible only when it transgressed the boundaries of a society dedicated to the common good, leading to the exploitation of others. He believed a strong government was essential to contain this inherent human vice, but cautioned against the potential for its own corruption.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly defined within its text. He feared that an expansive federal government would be prone to despotism and financial extravagance. However, he also cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, arguing that it risked misrepresenting the intent of the framers and potentially leading to corruption. Taylor placed greater significance on the Declaration of Independence, viewing it as the true embodiment of the nation's founding principles, as it more clearly articulated the concept of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This downturn was somewhat concerning, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. \n\nThe onset of winter at our New England campus likely contributed to the decrease, as commuting by bicycle or foot naturally diminishes during colder months.  December, coinciding with the end of the fall semester, also saw students and faculty preoccupied with academic demands and holiday preparations.  The importance of logging commutes may have simply slipped the minds of many during this busy period. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which campus attendance significantly decreases.  The low log submissions in January could be attributed to the post-break period, as routines are re-established. However, the low submissions for February remain unexplained.\n\nIt is possible that the project, like many initiatives, experienced an initial surge of enthusiasm that gradually waned. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign aimed at revitalizing participation. This effort was successful in increasing log submissions for that month.\n\nA key challenge encountered was maintaining project momentum amidst natural fluctuations in engagement, compounded by specific factors inherent to higher education, such as semester breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother obstacle faced by this project, and indeed any initiative promoting alternative commuting, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for individual car use. To encourage participation, a variety of incentives were offered, including gift certificates to local businesses and national retailers.  Exploring the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or electric cars, could have potentially boosted engagement, particularly during periods of decline. The value of prizes remained consistent throughout the project.  However, a strategy of progressively increasing prize value, perhaps announcing bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, might have further motivated participation.",
            "Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific market index, commodity, or a collection of assets.  Similar to index funds, ETFs offer diversification, but with the added flexibility of trading on stock exchanges like individual shares. This means investors can engage in strategies like short selling, margin buying, and purchasing fractional shares.\n\nWhile ETFs boast lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds, they do come with a trading commission, mirroring the cost structure of stock transactions.  The vast selection of ETFs available further enhances their appeal.\n\nHowever, it's crucial for discerning investors to critically assess the advertised benefits, such as diversification, and determine their actual extent.  To illustrate this, we'll analyze the ETF IHF and compare its performance to its top 10 holdings, which represent a significant portion of its assets. Our objective is to ascertain whether simply owning the ETF provides comparable advantages to holding a diversified portfolio of these individual stocks. We'll also explore if alternative stock combinations within this group could yield a more favorable risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nTo simplify our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. These holdings are listed below, along with their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how accurately these ten stocks represent the overall performance of ETF IHF, we can leverage the current asset percentages.  These percentages, normalized to 100%, will be used to calculate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions held by the ETF. The calculated Beta and Return values for each stock are presented in the following chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings generates a 6.11% higher return than the ETF itself, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings could potentially deliver a higher return with lower risk. However, it's important to determine if these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we'll analyze the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare its cumulative impact to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his most accomplished poems.  Within this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines six and fifty-six, a word that literary scholar Mabbott traces back to the writings of Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island situated north of Britain, a place perceived by the ancient Greeks as the furthest reaches of the known world. While Virgil's usage is well documented, it's essential to acknowledge another, more contemporary source that likely influenced Poe. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nA key point of interest arises from this connection to German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's and Goethe's respective poems, suggesting that Poe may have been inspired by Goethe's work.  The \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a renowned writer whose poetic drama \"Faust\" achieved widespread acclaim. This masterpiece was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second, during Goethe's final year, in 1832.  Nestled within the second part of \"Faust\" is a poignant short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This piece centers on a king whose grief-stricken state follows the death of his wife, who had gifted him a goblet. Consumed by sorrow, he drowns his pain in alcohol, haunted by memories of his deceased queen.  He ultimately decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children, except for the goblet.  He then walks to a cliff, tosses the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and takes his own life.  The demeanor of the \"King of Thulé\" and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, potentially reflecting Poe's own personal struggles and reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism.\n\nInterestingly, \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a year preceding Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Notably, Poe employs \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works. While he uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem like a bookend.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker paints a vivid picture of the desolate landscape of Thulé, describing it as dark, lonely, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with the themes of loss, sorrow, and despair that permeate \"The King of Thulé\" after Goethe's wife's passing.  The entire poem can be seen as a journey into the heart of Goethe's own emotional turmoil.\n\nGoethe's significance in the literary world would have made him a figure of great interest to Poe, especially considering Poe's admiration for Tennyson.  It is well-documented that Poe held Tennyson in high esteem.  Beyond this connection to Tennyson, Poe would have undoubtedly encountered Goethe's works through numerous reprints and adaptations circulating at the time.",
            "The question of whether punitive damages are warranted in a slip-and-fall case, specifically involving an applesauce spill in a California grocery store, presents a compelling legal issue. \n\nA judge would likely hesitate to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To successfully argue for such an award, Palmer must demonstrate that store manager Paul Martin acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm his actions could cause. She must also establish that Martin's conduct was particularly reprehensible.\n\nPalmer's argument hinges on the fact that Martin was informed of the spill twice, choosing to delay cleanup while on his dinner break.  She will likely assert that Martin should have been aware of the foreseeable danger posed by the spill, citing previous instances of customer slip-and-fall accidents at the store. While the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less strong, it is still supported by the number of similar incidents that occurred in 2009, suggesting a pattern of negligence.\n\nThe events leading up to Palmer's fall on October 13, 2009, paint a concerning picture. At 5:00 pm, employee Rich Wayne notified Martin of the spill but was met with the dismissal that Martin was unavailable during his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin to the same hazard, receiving a similar response. Tragically, at 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and sustained a serious back injury.  \n\nThis incident followed five other slip-and-fall accidents reported at D&D Markets in 2009, raising questions about the store's safety practices. Palmer's lawsuit against D&D seeks both compensatory and punitive damages. The legal team is currently evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded in cases where a defendant's conduct involved \"oppression, fraud or malice,\" even in the absence of a contractual obligation.  The statute defines malice as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct demonstrating a willful disregard for the safety and rights of others.",
            "During my studies at CBC, I delved into the complexities of Islam, engaging in thought-provoking discussions about its nature and perceptions.  The question of whether Islam is inherently hostile remains particularly pertinent in today's world. Observing the media landscape since 9/11, I've witnessed a dramatic shift in portrayals of Islam, transitioning from a predominantly negative perspective to one that veers towards excessive tolerance. This evolution is exemplified by the emergence of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose Muslim heritage sparked neither controversy nor widespread criticism.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad presents intriguing contradictions. My prior understanding, shaped by historical accounts, led me to believe that Muhammad was a forceful converter, conquering tribes and imposing Islam upon them. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and even self-effacing.  People, it suggests, gradually embraced his teachings after witnessing his humility and wisdom.\n\nFurthermore, I noticed striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the attributed \"miracles\" of Muhammad. One instance that particularly caught my attention was the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who relied on truth and divine intervention rather than seeking external validation. However, this approach, while seemingly innocuous, can inadvertently diminish the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles. It creates a sense of artistic borrowing, potentially undermining the unique identity of Jesus's message.\n\nSeveral accounts in the biography rely on third-party testimonies, raising concerns about their reliability.  The stories often involve a chain of narrators, each relaying information passed down from someone else. While the intention may be to provide corroboration, this reliance on hearsay weakens the stories' credibility and introduces an element of doubt.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. This idealized portrayal clashes with historical accounts that depict a different side to Muhammad's character.  I wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the complexities and contradictions surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought following Jesus' lifetime presents a fascinating case study. While his original teachings undoubtedly served as a foundation, subsequent developments have led to a divergence from those early beliefs.  \n\nThe modern world, characterized by its progressive inclinations, seems to be driving this shift further. Although traditional viewpoints persist, their influence may not be substantial enough to halt this trajectory. A growing awareness of history within the Christian community suggests a yearning to discern the authentic core of Jesus' message from the doctrines that have accumulated over time. \n\nThis could result in a significant historical reversal, a gradual return to Jesus' original teachings. Imagine a movement gaining momentum, meticulously peeling back layers of accumulated doctrine, as if time itself were in reverse, until only the essence of Jesus' initial message remains.  \n\nThis trend, when it reaches its peak in the United States and Europe, might lead to a resurgence of practices closer to Jesus' era, with a unified approach to faith.  This shift could also see a reduction in the diversity that currently characterizes Christendom, with greater similarities emerging across denominations and regions. \n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals. The Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to adopter of Christianity is one striking instance. Similarly, the United States has witnessed a remarkable evolution from a period of African-American slavery to one marked by African-American leadership.  \n\nThis impending reversal in the Christian landscape will likely involve a re-interpretation of Jesus' words, viewing them metaphorically rather than literally.\n\nLooking back in time, we see that Judaism, the precursor to Christianity, held the core theological tenets of monotheism, divinely revealed scriptures, and their authority.  The Jewish population in Roman times was not monolithic, encompassing various groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "Upton Sinclair's novel, \"The Jungle,\" delves into the inherent flaws within humanity, exposing a society where self-interest reigns supreme. The pursuit of personal gain overshadows any sense of compassion or concern for those less fortunate. This theme is starkly illustrated through the portrayal of factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit above all else.\n\nSinclair vividly depicts the industrial landscape, emphasizing the stark contrast between the imposing factories and the desolate environment they inhabit. The \"line of buildings\" stands \"clear-cut and black\" against the sky, while the \"great chimneys\" spew out \"a river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery underscores the disregard for the surrounding ecosystem and the well-being of those who live in its shadow.\n\nThe callous indifference of the owners extends to their workforce. Driven by an insatiable hunger for wealth, they exploit their employees, forcing them into grueling work conditions and subjecting them to arbitrary layoffs without any form of support. Sinclair's words paint a bleak picture of a system where individuals are reduced to mere cogs in a machine, their lives deemed expendable in the relentless pursuit of profit.\n\nHe highlights the absence of regulations and the powerlessness of the workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. Even the unions, intended to provide a voice for the laborers, become corrupted, exacerbating the plight of the already vulnerable. The workers are left with no recourse, their lives consumed by the harsh realities of Packingtown, a place where they are likened to \"slaves,\" subject to the whims of their brutal and unscrupulous masters.",
            "Authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding crucial themes.  The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of these strategies in his novel, *The Great Gatsby*.  He frequently juxtaposes adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to create a particular aura surrounding certain subjects. Additionally, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them for the same evocative purpose. Fitzgerald exemplifies this latter technique through his use of color symbolism, particularly gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.  \n\nWithin *The Great Gatsby*, Fitzgerald constructs nuanced meanings associated with color, notably white/gray and red/pink, which he later employs to elicit specific feelings in relation to significant objects. \n\nThe author establishes a connection between white/gray and uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated class while gray connotes age and faded grandeur. Fitzgerald introduces this semantic framework early in the narrative through consistent depictions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually adorned in white (8), and this sartorial preference extends to other characters: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instances where characters deviate from this white attire occur when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies the meanings associated with these colors by applying them to commonplace objects and settings. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's party guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is depicted as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a visual representation of uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary individuals and places as white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child (26) by the railroad, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs.\n\nAfter establishing a rich tapestry of meaning associated with white/gray, Fitzgerald strategically employs these colors to symbolize unimportance or conformity in relation to particular subjects. This technique is first evident in Daisy's portrayal. Following a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them when describing Daisy dressed in \"white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), subtly suggesting a shift in her characterization from a complex individual to a more uniform object of desire, something Gatsby yearns for. Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy's reduced individuality through subsequent descriptions, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant, sunny weather. The region is known for a variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a considerable demand for organic, locally-sourced produce in the San Diego area, with numerous community-supported agriculture programs experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and dairy products are also highly sought after.  Many organic farms offer visitors an opportunity to engage with their operations through tours and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation presents a unique opportunity for landowners to simultaneously benefit from government programs that support sustainable agriculture while enhancing local biodiversity and offering educational programs and recreational experiences, potentially generating additional income.\n\nBeyond its economic potential, organic farming offers several ecological advantages.  By eschewing synthetic chemicals, organic practices promote greater biodiversity among both plants and animals.  However, it's important to acknowledge that organic farming often comes with increased costs.  Labor-intensive methods are required for pest and weed management, as well as soil fertilization without the use of chemical inputs.  Furthermore, organic farming typically experiences higher crop losses compared to conventional methods.  Small-scale organic farms may also face challenges in achieving the same economies of scale as larger operations.  Similarly, practices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also demand more manpower, including activities such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or open patches.  These factors highlight the complexities faced by landowners seeking to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe specific parcel of land under consideration is located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  Spanning 160 acres, it encompasses a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest.  This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This comprehensive plan, currently under review, aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Other species are declining and are at risk of becoming endangered, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis region has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land, historically part of an original homestead patent, likely served as grazing land and/or a source of wood for many decades.  \n\nIn this scenario, a property was selected from a real estate website, and available government programs were researched to determine what options a small-scale farmer might realistically pursue to mitigate costs while preserving a wildlife-friendly agricultural operation.  To illustrate a potential model for success, a nearby organic farm was identified.",
            "The influence of cultural context is undeniably significant in any negotiation. Culture, more than a singular entity, is defined by its complexities and nuances, encompassing both its explicit and implicit aspects. Recognizing that cultures are not monolithic or uniform is crucial, dispelling generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" as overly simplistic and inaccurate. While acknowledging general cultural trends can be helpful, a negotiator benefits greatly from a deeper understanding of how a particular culture's values and perspectives will shape the negotiation process.  \n\nWhen encountering a new culture, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own, leading to insights and potential misunderstandings.  Comprehending a foreign culture involves a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical perspectives, societal norms, and even potential biases. Rather than imposing judgments or attempting to alter a culture, a respectful approach involves acceptance and adaptability. This is particularly important in negotiations, especially when a negotiator holds a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territory can significantly facilitate overcoming cultural barriers and fostering progress.\n\nCulture extends beyond national boundaries, manifesting itself within organizations as well. Companies often cultivate distinct corporate cultures, influencing aspects like work hours, dress codes, communication styles, and even charitable practices.  Observing these variations, such as contrasting work environments in American companies, highlights the diversity of thought that exists even within a single society. Cultures may appear more homogeneous from an outsider's perspective, but this often masks deeper complexities waiting to be explored.\n\nValues are paramount in understanding a culture, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers. For example, a culture that prioritizes \"saving face\" or communal harmony will likely influence negotiation strategies, discouraging public confrontations or actions that might bring shame upon individuals or organizations. Conversely, a culture that values assertiveness and a competitive spirit might approach negotiations with a more aggressive stance.\n\nWhile understanding cultural trends is valuable, it's equally important to gather insights into individual negotiators. Building rapport and understanding personal motivations can significantly enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originating in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This sentiment appears to resonate with another significant figure in our discussion, Thomas Aquinas.  As both theologians grapple with the same fundamental concept – the existence of God – our task is to determine the strength of their respective arguments. For the sake of clarity and brevity, let's assume, for now, that both Anselm and Aquinas are correct in their belief in the God described within the Bible.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison, as their arguments are specifically tailored to this particular understanding.\n\nDespite their compelling points, neither theologian, in my view, offers a fully comprehensive basis for belief in God. \n\nTo illustrate this, let's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection. He posits that because God exists within our comprehension, the very notion of his non-existence is inherently flawed. While his language may be dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the evidence for God's existence lies within our own minds. Anselm suggests that we needn't seek external validation; the truth about God is accessible through introspection and the examination of what we inherently know to be true. This reliance on internal knowledge, lacking demonstrable empirical proof, aligns with the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn stark contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas champions a purely rational and empirical approach to proving God's existence, rejecting the need for faith. This perspective holds significant appeal for evangelism, as it could potentially attract new followers without requiring them to embrace something unprovable. Instead, logic would serve as the primary persuasive tool. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the very existence of these phenomena logically necessitates the existence of God.  He uses the analogy of a missing puzzle piece to illustrate his point: even without seeing the missing piece, the incomplete puzzle logically dictates its existence and certain characteristics.",
            "The emergence of an individual who would later be known as Buddha took place in the 5th or 6th century BCE. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, leading to the establishment of Buddhism. This tradition, with Theravada Buddhism being its most orthodox branch, is approximately 2,500 years old.  It has evolved substantially since Buddha's lifetime, evident in diverse practices.  For example, in Sri Lanka, a country deeply rooted in Theravada Buddhism, a yearly water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and lay practitioners participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning any such festivity. These variations extend from outward customs to the core theological principles of the religion.  The Theravada Buddhist community, both in its monastic and lay segments, has undergone doctrinal shifts over time. This transformation can be attributed to a confluence of internal and external factors, both antagonistic and beneficial in nature.\n\nThis discourse will frequently employ specific terminology. The distinction between internal and external forces will be central. An internal force is defined as any influence originating from members of the Buddhasasana, irrespective of their monastic status. Conversely, an external force refers to any influence emanating from individuals outside the Buddhist tradition. A hostile force is any agency seeking to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, is one that neither intends to harm nor assist the Buddhist community, although its actions might inadvertently result in one or the other. These terms will recur throughout the discussion.\n\nInitially, it is crucial to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism—the doctrines that form its core. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially encompasses the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism.  Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential for ending Sansara, the cyclical journey of death and rebirth, which continues endlessly.  Simultaneously, Sansara will cease, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one achieves enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living. For laypeople, there are five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in sexual misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances. Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha—the truth that life is inherently suffering. Second, that attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico throughout the 19th century presents a compelling case study in international rivalry. For a period spanning nearly six decades, from 1836 to 1893, these two nations were locked in a complex dynamic marked by conflict and tension, as detailed by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145).  A pivotal moment in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring significant territory including Texas and the American Southwest.  \n\nNumerous other clashes punctuated this period, finally subsiding in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War I.  The roots of this rivalry stemmed from a confluence of factors, including fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests, as argued by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31). This pattern of border-related rivalry is not unique to the United States and Mexico. As Pletcher (1977) observes,  \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  The geographical proximity of Mexico and Cuba to the United States, coupled with their historical opposition to American influence, distinguishes them from other Latin American nations that have generally enjoyed more amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations, a theme that echoes throughout history. Frahm (2001) highlights this point, stating that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  The rivalry between the United States and Mexico, much like the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union, involved both ideological clashes and competition for perceived core interests. However, in this case, the ideological struggle revolved around religious beliefs rather than political systems. Underlying this distrust was a legacy of animosity inherited from the colonial era, with lingering resentment between the English and Spanish influencing Anglo-Mexican relations. \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 specific disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period of rivalry.  These disputes, primarily territorial in nature, often centered on border raids and frontier skirmishes. Banditry and lawlessness on both sides of the border posed a persistent challenge, requiring increased military presence to maintain order.  \n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico's economic reliance on the United States grew, and ultimately ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the late 19th century (p. 109, 110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, a new illness, one I'd never encountered, drastically altered my life. I was a nurse then, a profession I'd chosen for the stability it promised. As a child, I yearned for security, a longing that resonated through my adolescence.  \"Nursing is a safe bet,\" I was often told, \"Always in demand, always people needing care.\"  While my heart yearned for the worlds of science and journalism, I opted for the reassuring path of nursing.  \n\nLife, however, had other plans. At 46, single, and with limited savings, I found myself unable to work due to this mysterious illness. Fifteen years have passed since then, fifteen years spent relying on Social Security Disability.  Today, I possess little that truly belongs to me.  Each day is a struggle, a constant test of my resilience, chipping away at my sense of security and self-worth. Uncertainty permeates every aspect of my life, yet one truth shines through: without the unwavering support of my family and a few cherished friends, I wouldn't have weathered this storm.  \n\nLife inevitably throws curveballs, both large and small.  There are no guarantees, no matter how diligently we plan. Some challenges are simply too immense to face alone.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that reliance on government programs alone isn't the answer.  They are often burdened and faltering.  Instead, I believe in fostering a renewed sense of community, a willingness to support one another and seek help when needed.  Rather than isolating ourselves, we should be building bridges of compassion and mutual assistance.\n\nConservatives often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that shaped our nation.  Yet, it was not solely individualism that sustained our forefathers during trying times.  It was their shared values of compassion, respect, and resourcefulness that truly propelled them forward.  The pioneers who braved the treacherous journey across the Rockies did not succeed in isolation; they relied on the strength of their collective spirit.\n\nPreparation is crucial, and I, too, am prepared. I have a disaster kit stocked with first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows against potential threats.  Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods are readily available.  If you have the means, consider self-sufficiency through gardening or preserving food. A wood stove can be invaluable, as long as your living arrangements permit.\n\nBut amidst these preparations, remember the importance of connection.  Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and create a network of support.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the ways they do has long intrigued scientists.  Are there inherent limitations or guiding forces that shape the trajectory of evolutionary change?\n\nDespite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" recent advancements in mathematical modeling have illuminated certain aspects of mollusk skeletal development, both in terms of growth patterns (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research delves into the potential of mathematical modeling, used in conjunction with experimental studies, to unravel the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change.\n\nWe employed X-radiographic imaging of Prunum species to identify quantifiable characteristics of their shells. These parameters were then incorporated into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to construct models of both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. By simulating various shell forms, we aim to define the boundaries of possible morphological transformations within the Prunum lineage. These modeling results are being integrated with ongoing experimental and descriptive analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the macroevolutionary processes shaping this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that traverses a three-dimensional space over time. The revolutions or turns of the coiled shell are termed whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line, the suture, separates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one (the body whorl), while the spire encompasses all whorls except the last. The apex represents the tip of the spire, and its opposite end is referred to as the base. The aperture is the opening through which the animal protrudes from its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex directed upwards.\n\nCounting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the point where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter whorl if necessary.\n\nConsidering a shell as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal builds its shell, we can trace the path of the aperture by plotting the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to investigate the potential for altering the mollusk's skeletal development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates has stagnated over the past decade.  While the nation is on course to achieve several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health fall short of the necessary pace to meet the 2015 target.  The factors behind these shortcomings will be explored, highlighting the need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nSignificant strides have been made in ensuring skilled birth attendants are present for deliveries, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion. However, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners, like midwives, who lack the capacity to manage complications during pregnancy, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate attributed to hemorrhage.  Therefore, while this indicator shows improvement, it masks underlying challenges and demands further attention.  Furthermore, the percentage of childhood diarrhea cases treated by healthcare professionals under the age of five has declined, raising concerns.  \n\nData regarding postnatal care remains incomplete, but it is evident that this area requires urgent improvement due to low utilization rates nationwide.  Cesarean section rates remain below expected levels, hovering around 4%. This disparity in Cesarean section rates, with 7% in urban areas compared to 2% in rural regions, underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services.  Access to healthcare appears concentrated in urban centers, highlighting a need for greater geographic equity.  Moreover, there is a significant 27% gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest quintiles, indicating that the poor disproportionately face barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMoving forward, enhancing neonatal and maternal care indicators necessitates addressing the fundamental issue of service availability.  The question arises: should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or focus on strengthening the overall health system without concentrating solely on pre- and postnatal care?  While program-based solutions appear attractive due to their targeted nature, manageable objectives, and potential for quicker results, they are not without drawbacks.  \n\nConcentrating resources on a single area of the health sector can lead to neglect in other areas, diverting human resources and funding.  The impact of international funding on HIV/AIDS and its subsequent effect on family planning programs serves as a cautionary example.  Furthermore, implementing multiple parallel programs can result in service duplication and a lack of coordination, leading to administrative burdens and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocratic class of the era. However, two novels often classified as Victorian, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" diverge from this conventional mold. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, characteristics not typically associated with Victorian fiction. This departure strengthens the characters within each narrative, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose of these moments vary between the two. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal hidden aspects of Oliver's inner world, his pain, and his understanding of the reality surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, vividly conveyed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him; his senses are numbed as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, which now manifests as a constant and relentless torment linked with fear rather than surprise. This helplessness raises questions about the agency behind Oliver's misfortune, for it was clearly not his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his destiny, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of a situation, even when his life is in peril. The selection also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and hindering his ability to respond. It is reasonable to assume that, otherwise, Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save himself.\n\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program, providing academic support to elementary school students. While I was comfortable assisting with various subjects, I found my strengths particularly lay in English and reading.  One student, Adrian, a boy I believe was in either third or fourth grade, stood out. He was struggling significantly with reading,  exhibiting a peculiar pattern.  He could pronounce some letters accurately, while others seemed completely foreign to him. This was quite unusual. Adrian was of Latino heritage, as I recall, but he spoke English fluently. We faced challenges until I met his mother.  I was supervising a small group of children while the rest were on a field trip when she arrived.  She didn't speak a word of English, communicating solely in Spanish. My limited Spanish knowledge—I was just beginning to learn—allowed for a basic exchange.  That's when it clicked: Adrian wasn't unable to read; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this realization had a lasting impact on his progress, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the complexities of the language barrier in schools, particularly here in California. It underscores the fact that challenges are not always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English well, reading can present significant obstacles.  It's evident that this issue exists; the question is, what can we do about it?\n\nAdrian's situation had a relatively straightforward solution: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, the needs of children who have limited English proficiency are far more intricate. There's no one-size-fits-all answer.  Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes—none of these approaches, on their own, will fully address the problem. The key lies in a multifaceted approach, combining these strategies effectively.\n\nDual language programs offer a promising solution, not just for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs demonstrate superior academic performance compared to their peers.  Despite this, there's often fear surrounding these programs, with concerns about resource allocation and the lack of benefits for the majority of students. However, these concerns are unfounded. If we were to adopt dual language programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would stand to gain.\n\nThe question arises: should we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unreasonable and impractical.  However, I believe there's no reason we can't have dedicated bilingual aides or tutors to support language acquisition.",
            "From childhood, many of us are instilled with the idea of something grander than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some seek guidance in religious institutions, while others explore within or question its existence altogether.  Traditions often dictate our initial beliefs, but some actively reject them, clinging to the confines of their own limited perspective. Our values shift and evolve, leading us on a personal journey to define our spiritual selves.  We yearn for illumination, a guiding light to navigate the darkness and embrace the light of understanding.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird. We were seated on our porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a steady backdrop to our conversation. The overflowing gutters channeled the downpour, drenching the plants lining the edge of the porch. He gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of introspection and reminiscence.  I noticed how his frame had become more slender, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame.  His hair, once fuller, was now thinner, more sparse than I remembered.  He kept his eyes fixed on the rain, avoiding my gaze.  A profound sense of loneliness, fear, and helplessness washed over me, making it impossible to articulate my impending grief.  \n\nInstead, I reached out and embraced him, settling back into my chair and drawing closer to his side. We sat together, united in our silent contemplation of the falling rain as twilight descended.\n\n\nMy father's life ended in December of that year, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, though prolonging his existence beyond the doctors' expectations, failed to alleviate his suffering. I struggled to comprehend the purpose of extending his pain. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I questioned, alone in the darkness.  Prayer felt pointless, as if any divine presence had long since ceased to hear my pleas.\n\nWitnessing his final moments felt unbearable. I chose not to be present, unable to bear the sight of life's inevitable end. It was my father's essence, his vibrant life, that I wanted to remember, not the fragility of his passing. I knew him better than anyone else, surpassing even his family in my understanding. I was certain he wouldn't desire his only child to be a passive observer at his death. I retreated into the sanctuary of my bed, curling into a ball for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nBut no one contacted me.",
            "The concept of the Gothic novel presents a curious paradox, as literary scholar Ian Watt aptly describes it in his work, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" It's a genre that has been simultaneously criticized and celebrated, dismissed for its perceived lack of depth and lauded for its evocative power, particularly its ability to tap into a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" often recognized as the first Gothic novel, skillfully blends elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to establish a new literary form. Walpole himself utilizes  traditional theatrical conventions alongside a more contemporary focus on the natural world, a technique he labels \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic themes, evident in its theatrical elements, architectural motifs, and cultural references. Even at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto\"'s publication, the term \"Gothic\" had already acquired a wide range of associations, often perceived as antiquated or simplistic in comparison to the perceived advancements of the modern era. However, it is this very juxtaposition—the theatricality of the Gothic combined with the novel's ability to offer a more intimate exploration of character psychology—that has ensured its enduring appeal, allowing it to remain both timeless and strangely contemporary for readers separated from its origins by vast expanses of time.\n\nOne recurring motif in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of knighthood, the rigorous training that shaped a knight, is both preserved and reinterpreted in Walpole's seminal work. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers because it embodied the archetype of the heroic knight: brave, honorable, and competent. This ideal, which many Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, believed had been lost in contemporary society, became a source of longing and a benchmark against which to measure the perceived shortcomings of the present. Through their use of chivalric ideals and conventions, Gothic writers romanticize the \"Gothic past,\" hinting at the genre's future evolution towards Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a way to elevate and potentially improve the present.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of significant political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt a sense of despair about the future.  His writing reflects a yearning for a simpler, more morally upright era, a time when the inherent \"goodness\" of humanity, as exemplified by the chivalric code, was more pronounced. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic. Even before his introduction, the reader is presented with a character imbued with chivalric traits:\n\n [Insert the description of Frederic as provided in the original text here]\n\nThis description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has suffered tragedy and is presumed to have been killed by infidels, embodies many of the classic attributes of the gallant and courteous knight. However, as with many Gothic tropes, this ideal is exaggerated, introducing an element of excess that would become a hallmark of the genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management refers to the intricate network of processes involved in bringing goods from initial customer demand to their final destination. \n\nThis concept, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, emphasizes the importance of planning, executing, and overseeing every stage of the supply chain to ensure customer satisfaction through efficiency and speed.\n\nSix fundamental elements underpin a robust supply chain: production, procurement, inventory management, location strategy, transportation, and information flow.  By skillfully managing these elements, businesses can deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the cornerstone of the supply chain, involves defining the \"who, what, when, and where\" of goods creation. Understanding customer needs is paramount, and analyzing market trends provides valuable insights into demand.  Based on this analysis, managers determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities.  \n\nLocation selection for production is crucial, considering factors like production volume, quality standards, and proximity to customer markets.  Concurrent with this, managers prioritize scheduling production workloads and ensuring equipment maintenance. Production's meticulous planning is essential; any oversight can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nTake, for instance, my experiences at retail giants like Walmart and Target. Both companies meticulously document every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These standardized procedures ensure smooth workflows and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key element, supply, encompasses strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and the selection of outsourcing partners.  \n\nA single product might have multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must strategically allocate production to the most suitable division based on the product's specific requirements. Outsourcing can also be a strategic choice, often driven by the need to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.",
            "A peculiar sign, held aloft by actress Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" draws the eye on a bustling street corner. Scribbled in Sharpie on cardboard, the message reads: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"  This unsettling statement prompts a reflection on the situation in Burma, officially known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation grappling with a long-standing military dictatorship. \n\nThe current regime, which seized power in a coup in 1962, has a history of suppressing dissent. In 2007, a wave of protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" for the saffron robes worn by the leading Buddhist monks, erupted across the country. Initially peaceful, the demonstrations escalated into a violent clash between the monks and the military.  \n\nThe crackdown drew international condemnation. Journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, were detained and, in Nagai's case, tragically killed while covering the unrest.  While the official death toll remains disputed, a defected military officer claimed the true figure to be far higher.\n\nThis tragic episode in Burmese history sadly echoes a recurring theme throughout human history: the struggle against oppressive regimes. From ancient Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to modern-day dictatorships, the desire to control and silence opposition is a persistent challenge to freedom and human rights.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where Chinese citizens gathered to demand political reform, serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of such suppression. Estimates of the casualties vary widely, with official figures vastly lower than those reported by independent sources. Similarly, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, fueled by ethnic hatred and government inaction, resulted in the systematic massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus.  \n\nThe atrocities of Nazi Germany, with its systematic extermination of Jews and other persecuted groups, stand as a chilling testament to the depths of human cruelty and the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz genre is significantly rooted in his prolonged career and, consequently, his remarkable ability to mold his orchestra. While his piano presence might be understated in several of the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his creation of intricate and layered pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his musicians. He meticulously crafted a framework that allowed soloists to freely express themselves while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically catered to the unique styles of individual band members, thereby illuminating musical concepts in a distinctive manner. This approach also served to emphasize the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in cohesive and original soundscapes that perfectly complemented each composition. Ellington's mastery over the individual voices within his ensemble, as well as their collective synergy, empowered him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and masterful works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's innovative sound, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his consistent use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early composition exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrical content. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's aptitude for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work. This gradual, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds over six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between voice and reeds, commencing with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions into a more raspy tone towards its conclusion.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the fundamental melody and accentuates several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo performed in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano interlude.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, engaging in a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by a rhythmic \"stop-time\" backdrop provided by the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this instance, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, assuming the role of a solo instrument.\nTag: A brief concluding section featuring a vocal flourish and a dissonant, unexpected ending delivered by a trombone.\n\nEllington's strategic employment of voice to enrich the tonal palette of this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that pervades his entire oeuvre.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his talent for precise orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color.  A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously merges the vocal qualities of Miley's trumpet playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, resulting in a harmonious and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands upon these concepts, as Ellington skillfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to deliver the melody on muted trombone with remarkable impact.",
            "From a young age, she felt a persistent yearning, a void that seemed impossible to fill. This dissatisfaction first emerged around the time she turned fourteen, during the tumultuous transition into adolescence. Three years later, at seventeen, the feeling remained, now morphing into a desire for companionship rather than material possessions. However, no boys captured her interest. Though some showed interest in her, their attempts at courtship were met with indifference. She often pondered this peculiar phenomenon, trying to unravel the cause of her uncharacteristic apathy towards romance. Years of introspection yielded several theories, but none were convincing enough to warrant serious consideration. Thus, she carried on with her life, perpetually questioning her own desires.\n\nHer family life was typically tranquil. Her parents were amiable and composed individuals, rarely clashing with each other. Disputes with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their only disagreements stemmed from her assertive nature and independent spirit, which often contrasted with their calm demeanor. Though they were a remarkably peaceful pair, she possessed a vibrant and outgoing personality, making her both likable and endearing.\n\nHowever, this day was anything but ordinary. As she wandered through the house, seeking inspiration for her own pursuits, a sudden cry pierced the air. It was her mother's voice, filled with distress, emanating from the kitchen. Her heart pounding, she rushed to the room, her voice laced with concern, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" There she found her mother lying on the floor, writhing in pain, her gasps punctuated by pained groans. Rushing to her side, she gently touched her mother, offering comfort and support. \"Ouch...sweetheart, I...need you to take me to...the hospital,\" her mother's words were strained and fragmented. The urgency in her voice left no room for doubt; she was in excruciating pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the fear threatening to engulf her. Her mother guided her hands, and in that moment, the daughter, a product of her own physical training, felt a surge of gratitude for her strength. She carefully lifted her mother, laid her gently in the backseat of the car, and drove towards the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a sensory overload: the sharp scent of disinfectant mingled with the metallic tang of fear and illness. Yet, her anxiety was overshadowed by her determination to help her mother. She swiftly carried her mother inside, calling for medical assistance. Several worried faces gathered around, a rolling bed was swiftly brought, and her mother was gently laid upon it. They rushed her away for immediate treatment, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious contemplation.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research investigated the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern similar to the Mediterranean diet (referred to as the \"alternate Mediterranean\" or aMed diet) and the risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also encourages moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a connection between following a Mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of both total and cardiovascular mortality. One trial even demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these studies hadn't focused specifically on stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed a group of 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study tracking the health of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. These women had no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers assessed their adherence to the aMed diet using detailed food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) completed six times. These questionnaires were designed to pinpoint the types and amounts of food consumed in the previous year.  Validation studies ensured the accuracy of the FFQs.\n\nInformation about the women's health was obtained through medical records, hospital records, autopsies, and death certificates. Some cases, particularly strokes and nonfatal heart attacks, were classified as \"probable\" based on self-reported information, as complete medical records weren't always available.  The researchers also gathered data on factors like body mass index, smoking habits, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone therapy use. Starting in 1986, they also assessed the women's levels of physical activity.\n\nTo account for variations in individual dietary patterns and better reflect long-term eating habits, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed diet scores from the repeated FFQs. These averages were based on combining scores from the two preceding years. To ensure the findings weren't skewed by other factors (confounders), the researchers adjusted their analysis for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nStatistical models called Cox proportional-hazard models were used to determine the link between the aMed diet score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases.\n\n\nThe study found a clear association between a higher aMed diet score (indicating greater adherence to the Mediterranean-style eating pattern) and a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in these women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the highest aMed quintile (meaning their diet most closely resembled the aMed pattern) had a significantly lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a pivotal moment in American history, witnessing the nation grapple with a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market experienced a dramatic collapse, and numerous prominent corporations faced imminent ruin. The repercussions of this economic downturn continue to be felt today, prompting a crucial inquiry: What factors contributed to this crisis, and how can we prevent its recurrence?\n\nAt the heart of the crisis lay a confluence of political decisions that prioritized short-term gains over long-term stability. These policies, driven by a desire to promote lending and economic expansion, encouraged banks and financial institutions to extend sub-prime loans to borrowers with questionable creditworthiness. This practice, coupled with a financial system that lacked adequate safeguards and oversight, created a volatile environment ripe for disaster.\n\nEnter Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises tasked with facilitating the housing market. Under pressure to expand access to homeownership, they were incentivized to purchase and repackage these sub-prime mortgages into complex financial instruments known as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and Credit Default Swaps (CDSs). This intricate web of interconnected financial products obscured the underlying risks associated with these risky loans.\n\nWhen borrowers began defaulting on their mortgages at an alarming rate, the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse. Banks, burdened with vast amounts of mortgage debt, faced a liquidity crisis. The repercussions rippled through the interconnected financial markets, infecting institutions that had invested in CDOs and CDSs, ultimately leading to a widespread loss of confidence and a crippling credit freeze.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown several years earlier, during the Clinton administration's push for increased homeownership. In an effort to boost his re-election prospects, President Clinton relaxed lending regulations, creating an environment where sub-prime mortgages proliferated.\n\nThis loosening of lending standards, coupled with the intricate and opaque nature of mortgage-backed securities, created a perfect storm that ultimately culminated in the 2007 financial crisis. The consequences were devastating, leaving millions unemployed, homeowners facing foreclosure, and the global economy teetering on the edge of recession.",
            "Exposition. That word can strike fear into the heart of even the most seasoned writer. It's the point in a story where you, the author, can either soar to new heights of literary brilliance or plummet into the abyss of reader boredom.  \n\nThink of it this way: exposition is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's a necessary tool for setting the stage, introducing characters, and establishing the world your story inhabits. On the other hand, it can quickly become a drag if overdone, leaving your readers longing for something, well, more exciting.\n\nYou've probably heard the golden rule of writing: \"Show, don't tell.\" But even seasoned writers can fall into the trap of exposition overload. It's that inner voice whispering, \"Just get the backstory out there so we can get to the good stuff!\" But remember, readers don't just want the bare facts; they want to experience the story alongside your characters.\n\nImagine you're reading a story, and the hero's past is laid out in a long, descriptive paragraph. You learn about his childhood, his loves, his losses, his every waking thought – all in a matter of sentences. It's like being bombarded with information instead of being drawn into the story organically.\n\nInstead, consider weaving those details into the narrative itself. Let the characters reveal themselves through their actions, their dialogue, their interactions with others. Show us the hero's love for his wife through their tender moments together, or hint at his past struggles through his guarded demeanor. Let the readers piece together his story, just as they would in real life.\n\nTake the example of a new character, a former Air Force pilot turned gas station attendant.  Instead of simply stating his facts, show us his military background through subtle clues: a worn dog tag, a slight tremor in his hand, a distant look in his eyes.  Reveal his dreams of owning the gas station through his interactions with the customers, his meticulous care of the pumps, his quiet contemplation during slow nights. \n\nRemember, exposition is a tool, not a crutch. Use it sparingly, strategically, and always with the goal of enriching your story and engaging your readers.",
            "My attention was drawn to a couple of news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first, a live report from NBC 4, covered the unfolding story of a stabbing in Ashley, Ohio. The suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed. While details were limited - something to the effect that the victim, whose name was withheld, had been stabbed multiple times -  the incident was reported with appropriate brevity given its developing nature. \n\nThe following segment focused on a shooting that had occurred earlier that morning in the Sharon Woods area. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, was critically injured, and the investigation was ongoing with no leads or suspects at the time. The SWAT team was reportedly involved.\n\nThis story felt somewhat abbreviated, and a thought occurred to me: could the brevity be linked to the fact that both the victim and the neighborhood were predominantly Black?  I've noticed a pattern in media coverage where crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention compared to those involving white victims.  Kidnappings, missing persons, or violent crimes against white individuals tend to dominate news cycles, while similar incidents affecting minority communities often receive minimal coverage.\n\nThe next story shifted gears to a different type of incident: a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter.  The location of the incident and the suspected caliber of the weapon used (a .22 caliber rifle) were discussed, and Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nA brief weather segment followed, providing a preview of the weekend's predicted thunderstorms and temperatures.\n\nThen, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was reported.  Details about the suspect, described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, were provided, including his height and weight. The emphasis placed on his race and skin tone struck me as unusual.\n\nThe final story of the broadcast covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for his involvement in a marijuana distribution ring operating between Texas and Ohio.  Interestingly, instead of stating the sentence as 25 years, they used the numerical equivalent, \"300 months.\"  The reason for this choice was unclear, but it seemed somewhat noteworthy. Additionally, his Hispanic ethnicity was mentioned, which I found to be somewhat tangential to the main narrative.",
            "The relationship between brothers is complex, woven from an intricate tapestry of emotions.  Love and pride exist side-by-side with jealousy and even cruelty, a unique blend found nowhere else.  Brothers possess an understanding that transcends ordinary bonds, a mirror reflecting their own souls back at them. This profound connection is most vividly revealed in moments of crisis, revealing its inherent duality—capable of both remarkable strength and devastating darkness.  The weight of these emotions, both positive and negative, carries significant consequences. Truly understanding the nature of this fraternal bond means grappling with the repercussions of these feelings. Looking into a brother's eyes is not simply seeing another person; it's gazing into one's own reflection, unfiltered and raw. It's within their actions and the inevitable outcomes of those choices that their fundamental character is laid bare.  \n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\"  explores this intricate theme, delving into the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a backdrop of lush beauty, two young brothers embark on a journey fraught with futility. Their quest culminates in a poignant clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother to bear the weight of survival. The story's exploration of the theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their evolving relationship.  The narrative voice further amplifies this exploration, offering a glimpse into the protagonist's complex emotional landscape and their perception of the world around them—influences that profoundly shape their actions.\n\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial forays into the world together to their final, fateful adventure, resentment simmers beneath the surface of the protagonist's interactions with Doodle.  He yearns for a brother who can be his partner in all endeavors, someone to share his skills and experiences with. He envisions a brother who can keep pace with him, someone to race with, to climb trees, and to explore the hidden corners of their world.  \n\nDoodle's physical limitations shatter these dreams.  Born with a weak heart, Doodle's future seemed precarious at best, his participation in the protagonist's imagined adventures impossible. The blow to the protagonist's dreams was profound, leaving him grappling with anger and even contemplating unthinkable acts against his younger brother.  However, Doodle's innocent smile evokes a flicker of tenderness within the protagonist, revealing a deep-seated affection that undermines his darker impulses. This suggests that the protagonist's initial resentment was perhaps not absolute, overshadowed by a fundamental, albeit suppressed, love for his brother.",
            "The human brain operates as a complex system, dedicated to processing and generating creative outputs.  As technology has progressed, our understanding of the brain has also evolved, reflected in the evolving metaphors used to describe its function. Early comparisons likened the brain to simple storage devices like wax tablets or papyrus scrolls. Later, the analogy shifted to the book, and most recently, the computer.  However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful, have limitations and can sometimes lead to misconceptions about how the brain truly works.\n\nThe journey of information through the brain begins with its reception by our sensory organs. These organs convert external stimuli – sensations like touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrochemical signals.  The brain then processes this sensory information through a series of intricate steps, employing both \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" approaches.  Imagine viewing a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes the fundamental elements: color, shape, and boundaries. By piecing together these basic elements, the brain determines that you are seeing a box.  Top-down processing, on the other hand, utilizes prior knowledge and expectations to expedite this recognition. In this case, your understanding of what a \"box\" is helps you quickly identify the object, distinguishing it from a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain extent, a sophisticated filter, known as attention, determines its significance and directs it towards relevant cognitive processes.  For example, while your brain registers every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, your attention filter prevents you from consciously noticing each one individually.  Conversely, your name, even amidst a bustling environment, will likely capture your attention.  This intricate process of information processing and modulation by attention occurs in multiple stages.\n\nTo function effectively, the brain requires a system for storing information. This involves various types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. The initial stage is encoding, where information is transformed into a format suitable for storage. Different types of sensory input are encoded in distinct ways. For example, verbal information can be encoded structurally (based on its appearance), phonemically (based on its sound), or semantically (based on its meaning). Once information is stored, it must be maintained.  Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical signal circulating through a specific group of neurons.  Long-term memory, on the other hand, is theorized to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models have been proposed to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. These models draw upon insights from human memory recall, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model is the semantic network model, which posits that knowledge is represented as nodes, each representing a concept. These nodes are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, \"Brave New World,\" the author explores the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its close ties to a capitalist system. The novel paints a chilling picture of a society where individualism is sacrificed for the sake of collective harmony, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. \n\nExamining the work through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's deep-seated anxieties about the emerging economic order of his time. Terms like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist thought, resonate throughout the narrative, suggesting that Huxley saw these societal trends as inherently flawed.\n\nHuxley masterfully satirizes capitalism through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" a Marxist idea that describes the manipulation of the working class into accepting their subordinate position. In \"Brave New World,\" the citizens are so preoccupied with their immediate desires, fueled by relentless consumerism, that they remain blind to the true power dynamics at play. The lower castes, Delta and Gamma, for instance, are practically devoid of independent thought, their desires shaped by the insidious power of hypnopædia, a sleep-learning technique used to instill a thirst for consumption. This control is orchestrated by the World Controller, who embodies the oppressive force of the ruling elite.\n\nThe novel vividly portrays \"hegemony,\" a Marxist concept where one social class dominates others, leaving the lower classes unaware of their exploitation. The citizens of \"Brave New World\" unquestioningly embrace the system, \"buying into\" an ideology that perpetuates their own subjugation. The upper classes, though aware of the manipulation, remain complicit, accepting their privileged position without challenge.\n\nThe novel further explores the corrosive effects of capitalism on human relationships.  The characters, even those deemed central to the plot, lack depth and individuality. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the relentless march of technology and capitalism ultimately strips individuals of their free will and capacity for genuine connection. Love and emotional depth are absent; interactions are superficial and driven by materialistic desires. The focus on physical appearance, particularly in the way males regard females, highlights the reductionism inherent in a consumerist society. \n\nThe citizens' unquestioning acceptance of their social hierarchy mirrors Marxist notions of the proletariat, who are falsely reassured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform. Their unwavering obedience to their designated roles within the social structure serves as a stark commentary on the potential dangers of unchecked capitalist systems.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating this campus, like many others, can pose a challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center.  Journeying from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in locations such as Willard building, nestled near the campus core, often took 25 minutes on foot, particularly arduous when confronted with the frequent inclement weather State College is known for.  Through conversations with an alumnus, not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago, the East Halls complex was isolated from the rest of the institution by vast expanses of undeveloped land. Today, this once-empty space has been transformed into a vibrant hub of activity, featuring sports fields, imposing new structures like the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of residential apartments. As our campus continues to expand, traversing its sprawling grounds becomes increasingly intricate. What then, is the most effective solution to this mobility dilemma?  In the context of a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer.\n\nHowever, the bicycle alone cannot single-handedly resolve this issue. Student adoption and a campus infrastructure designed to accommodate cyclists are essential.\n\nRecently, I engaged in a discussion with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a multi-year hiatus. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, stating, \"Bikes are superb; for a while, it wasn't considered fashionable to ride, but it's undeniably the most practical means of getting around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling offers unparalleled efficiency. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a moderate amount of exertion can propel you over 30 miles. Like numerous undergraduates, I now reside off campus, a distance from the campus center comparable to some residence halls. The most astute decision I've made this year was acquiring a bicycle. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, a location at least a 25-minute walk from my home. Cycling significantly reduces this travel time to a mere 5 minutes, provided I maintain a brisk pace. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, the most direct route from my residence to Thomas building, is not always a smooth journey, whether on foot or by bike. While there are merits to walking, my schedule leaves little room for it. Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole reliable option for reaching my classes. Commuting to Thomas on foot daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours each week.  Factor in the time required for walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, and it becomes clear that walking is simply not feasible."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "Driven by a deep-seated desire to make a difference in the lives of vulnerable children, I aspire to pursue a career within the Division of Family and Children Services. My goal is to provide essential support to children who have experienced abuse or neglect, while also offering guidance and assistance to families facing challenges. I believe the values that I embody – service, respect, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships – are fundamental not only to the field of social work but also to my personal life.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I've been drawn to helping others. Witnessing individuals struggling with adversity, often resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, solidified my desire to make a positive impact. My undergraduate studies in Psychology provided me with a foundation for understanding human behavior, but it was a specific encounter that truly ignited my passion for social work.\n\nOne summer, I met a young man who had sought refuge with a friend, fleeing an abusive home environment. This experience sparked a profound realization about the urgent need for support services for children in crisis. When I learned of his subsequent call to the authorities, I reached out to his parents, hoping to offer assistance.  Through a conversation with them, I became acutely aware of the complexities of family dynamics and the challenges faced by those seeking help. This experience solidified my commitment to pursuing a career where I could directly advocate for children and families in need.\n\nSocial justice is another core value that resonates deeply with me. While society often emphasizes the importance of the individual, we often fall short of truly embracing uniqueness. The pursuit of conformity can stifle individual expression and perpetuate social inequities. Throughout my time in high school and college, I actively challenged societal norms and stood up against injustice in various ways, from expressing myself through unconventional fashion choices to participating in advocacy groups and speaking out against discrimination. I believe in fostering a society that values individual expression and ensures equal opportunities for all. My commitment to social justice will undoubtedly guide my work as a social worker.",
            "This paper explores the interplay between biological and sociocultural factors in understanding the complexities of insomnia. The biological perspective delves into the role of inherited genetic predispositions and physical health conditions in sleep disruption. Conversely, sociocultural models examine the influence of environmental factors, considering variables such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic standing, and social relationships. This review critically analyzes existing research on insomnia, aiming to shed light on how these distinct models contribute to our comprehension of the disorder.\n\nSleep disorders can be broadly categorized into three main types: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders arising from medical or substance-related issues. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias, characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, and Parasomnias, involving unusual behaviors or physiological events during sleep. Within Dyssomnias, we find conditions like insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and unspecified dyssomnias.  Sleep disorders linked to mental health often stem from conditions classified under Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or intellectual disabilities) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, with some broader considerations of primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the influence of genetics, inherited traits, and physiological mechanisms. For instance, neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake cycles. Research involving mice has revealed the presence of specific GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, which are directly involved in sleep-wake regulation. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and sleepiness. Studies utilizing a GABAB agonist (baclofen) have demonstrated an increase in sleep duration in mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). While animal models cannot be directly extrapolated to humans, these findings suggest a potential genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans.  Variations or malfunctions in this receptor could potentially impact sleep quality, potentially requiring medication for adequate sleep. From a sociocultural perspective, if these genetic predispositions are inherited, they might influence an individual's sleep patterns. Consequently, alterations in the GABAB receptor could naturally disrupt sleep, negatively affecting various aspects of life, including academic performance, career success, and daily activities that require sustained attention and focus.",
            "This document examines three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  Firstly, it defines the disorder concisely. Next, it explores the diagnostic process, outlining common indicators or \"red flags.\" Finally, the document concludes by outlining strategies a teacher in an inclusive classroom setting can employ to support a student with CAPD.\n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), also known as Auditory Processing Disorder (APD),  refers to how effectively the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  A precise definition, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005), is that it involves the perceptual processing of auditory input within the CNS, including the neurobiological activity that underpins this processing and gives rise to electrophysiological auditory responses. In essence, CAPD presents as a difficulty in the brain's ability to properly process auditory input. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\" The issue stems from the brain's inability to effectively translate sounds, distinguishing words or separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest documented instances of what would become known as CAPD surfaced in the mid-1950s, referred to as \"auditory imperception\" (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005).  Researchers at the time were studying children with communicative disorders.  An Italian research team, consisting of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing assessments for these children in 1954.  In 1961, Kimura introduced dichotic testing and proposed a model explaining the physiological basis of CNS function in dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference in 1977 significantly stimulated research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD manifests in diverse ways. An individual might struggle to localize or perceive sounds spatially, have difficulty distinguishing between two or more auditory events, or recognize sound patterns. They may also have trouble differentiating changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm based on vocal inflection.  One sound might be masked by a subsequent sound, and they might struggle to synthesize auditory cues, interpreting them in a meaningful way to guide their actions. Additionally, they might have difficulty determining the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves systematic observation of listening behaviors and performance on auditory function tests, conducted by professionals such as audiologists, speech-language pathologists, or psychologists. These professionals utilize a variety of measures to evaluate auditory-related skills, including questionnaires, surveys, and direct observation of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli.  Currently, no single test or tool consistently achieves a high diagnostic success rate, and the cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many assessments present individuals with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers. More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to those signals.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complex consequences of disguise, suggesting that while it can be a powerful tool for deception, its prolonged use risks erasing one's true identity. The act of revealing a concealed persona, however, often leads to social isolation.  Individuals may find themselves caught between the need for self-preservation and the desire to maintain relationships. While some might react with indifference to the unraveling of a deception, others are likely to feel deeply hurt and offended.\n\nThe play delves particularly into the challenges of gender deception, raising crucial questions about the motivations behind such a choice. Why would someone choose to abandon their own identity and assume the guise of the opposite gender? In Viola's case, her disguise serves as a form of self-protection: \"I'll bring you to a captain in this town / Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help / I was preserved to serve this noble count...\" (5.1.247-249).\n\nArriving in a foreign land, Viola finds it necessary to present herself as a man to safeguard herself from potential harm. Her strategy proves successful but isolates her from the female community, severing her access to a vital support system.  Furthermore, her convincing performance leads to a misunderstanding, as Olivia mistakenly believes her to be Sebastian and develops romantic feelings: \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.\" (5.1.138). This adds another layer of complexity to Viola's situation, as she must navigate suppressed romantic desires from Orsino: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times / Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261).\n\nDespite its potentially progressive elements, \"Twelfth Night\" might be interpreted as an exploration of how deception can bring suppressed emotions to the surface, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters may harbor unexpressed subconscious desires that are triggered by Viola/Cesario's presence. For example, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario purely based on his perceived masculinity, or does it reveal a deeper, unacknowledged longing? While this interpretation is debatable, Shakespeare's portrayal of Olivia suggests a critique of those who judge individuals solely based on appearances. This is evident in her swift shift from romantic interest in Cesario to Sebastian, and her subsequent acceptance of Cesario/Viola as a familial figure: \"A sister, you are she.\" (5.1.315).",
            "The legacy of German colonial rule is marked by instances of brutality, particularly the devastating genocide perpetrated against the Ovaherero and Nama peoples in German South West Africa. However, reducing the complexities of an entire colonial empire to such a singular act would be an oversimplification.  \n\nThe German colonial enterprise exhibited a wide spectrum of policies and governing styles, mirroring the diverse geographical landscapes it encompassed. Educational initiatives across the colonies followed a similar pattern of variation. When British forces assumed control of German East Africa (now known as Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a considerable population of educated and literate Africans. Contemporary accounts also lauded German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other territories. \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast.  Unlike East Africa, where the government established state-run schools and actively engaged in the education of the local population, South West Africa's responsibility for native education was largely delegated to missionary societies, receiving only nominal government support. The German administration, however, made substantial investments in the education of European colonists, establishing a network of state schools and providing substantial financial and regulatory backing to missionary institutions. These divergent educational policies had a lasting impact on South West Africa, extending even beyond the period of German rule.  While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of educated and literate Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by educational advancements, with the \"overwhelming majority\" of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate.\n\nA confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this stark disparity in educational outcomes. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, giving particular attention to recent research exploring the attitudes of colonial authorities and European settlers towards the native African population.\n\nA substantial body of literature addresses the subject of education within the German colonial empire. The majority of these sources are in German and were produced during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. Early works primarily focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific educational aspects. These studies illuminated significant variations in the educational systems of different colonies.  The most prominent work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen's study on education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies, examining the factors contributing to their disparities. He posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa explains many of the unique features of the colony's educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, although much of the territory was characterized by arid desert. The European population in South West Africa mirrored these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 Europeans resided in South West Africa, compared to only 5,336 in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The realm of popular music has witnessed an explosion of genres over the past century, making a comprehensive list a daunting task. This complexity is further amplified by the proliferation of subgenres within each established category, from rap and rock to country, jazz, and folk, to name just a few. Among these, heavy metal rock has emerged as a particularly dynamic and expressive force in popular music over the last four decades. Its expressiveness stems from its wide emotional range, often gravitating towards darker themes.  \n\nHeavy metal's diversity is equally notable. From its early days, musicians recognized its inherent flexibility, leading to the creation of distinct subgenres, which in turn spawned sub-subgenres, and so on, continuing to evolve to the present day.\n\nToday, the heavy metal landscape is characterized by a vast array of niche groups, blurring the lines of what constitutes \"heavy metal\" itself.  Despite its expansive reach and incorporation of influences from other genres, heavy metal undeniably originated from a specific source. To truly understand the diverse metal music prevalent today, one must delve into the origins of the heavy metal movement and its significance as a cultural phenomenon rather than merely a musical genre.\n\nAt its core, heavy metal is a movement defined by its embrace of darkness. It can be seen as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, more theatricality.  It eschews primitiveness in favor of technical proficiency, with musicians demonstrating exceptional instrumental skill. Furthermore, heavy metal is intrinsically linked to the influence of drugs. The psychedelic drug culture of the mid-1970s spurred experimentation and creativity, resulting in unconventional and otherworldly musical expressions. The use of drugs became a recurring motif in the movement, often serving as a catalyst for its raw and visceral qualities.\n\nHeavy metal's dark and visceral nature stood in stark contrast to the prevailing musical trends of the time, which often shied away from exploring the darker aspects of the human experience.  Subsequent generations of metal musicians drew inspiration from the same dark, emotional depths explored by Romantic Era artists. Lyrics like those from the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" exemplify this inherent darkness.  The song, with its fluctuating dynamics, arguably depicting the effects of drug use, is considered by some to be a precursor to heavy metal. It served as a response to the Rolling Stones' foray into heavier and darker sounds, demonstrating the Beatles' willingness to explore similar territory.",
            "Prior to the emergence of Surrealism, a painter named Henri Rousseau was meticulously constructing his own artistic dreams, both literally and metaphorically. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" transcends the depiction of a woman awestruck by a dream landscape; it embodies Rousseau's personal aspirations as an artist. From the outset of his career, Rousseau yearned for recognition, acceptance, and the acclaim of fellow artists and art enthusiasts. This desire presented him with a significant internal conflict: to conform to prevailing painting styles in order to gain approval from the art world he admired, or to forge his own path, embracing creative independence and uniqueness.  \"The Dream\" stands as the most poignant expression of Rousseau's lifelong struggle between conformity and individuality.\n\nTo fully comprehend the layers of meaning within \"The Dream,\" one must first delve into Rousseau's personal narrative. Born in Laval, France, in 1844, Rousseau's upbringing lacked formal artistic training.  He spent his early years working as a toll collector for the French government, earning him the nickname \"douanier,\" despite the discrepancy from his actual profession. The loss of his first wife, Clémence, followed by the deaths of eight infants, left Rousseau with profound grief and a daughter named Julia. Painting became a refuge, a means of solace and a fresh start. Unlike contemporary artists who romanticized the peasant life, Rousseau, a self-taught artist, captured the aspirations and dreams of the ordinary individual.\n\nRousseau's fervent desire for acceptance within the art world can be attributed to his circumstances. He began his artistic journey later in life, without formal training, amidst a thriving scene of talented and established modern artists.  Despite years of dedicated work, recognition eluded him until a time when Matisse was already gaining prominence. Jan Gordon, in her book \"Modern French Painters,\" highlights the distinct differences between these two artists, noting that while they shared the competitive landscape of the art world, their motivations diverged significantly.  According to Gordon, \"Matisse was driven by a fear of painting conventionally, while Rousseau's ambition was to create such a conventional painting that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "The intertwining of ethics and aesthetics has long fascinated thinkers who recognize a deep-seated connection between truth and beauty. This bond, I believe, stems from a fundamental truth about human experience. As John Keats eloquently expresses in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While much of our knowledge is acquired through formal education or lived experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional pathways. \n\nBoth ethics and aesthetics, in essence, strive to illuminate rather than dictate. Our exploration of morality and beauty primarily seeks to decipher the reasons behind the captivating nature of a piece of art or literature, or the ethical implications of an action, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating such works. \n\nFurthermore, any attempt to fully capture the essence of what is considered good or beautiful through critical analysis proves ultimately inadequate. For example, discussions surrounding the merits of da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" may delve into technical aspects like composition, color, and historical context, yet these elements fail to fully explain its enduring appeal. When asked about a cherished work of art or literature, individuals often preface their explanations with a phrase like \"There's just something about it,\" hinting at an intangible quality that defies precise articulation. \n\nI contend that both art and morality possess an inherent element that transcends mere description. As Flannery O'Connor aptly states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how meticulously we analyze the characteristics of a literary work, a certain profound essence remains elusive. I believe ethics shares this same quality. Wittgenstein's assertion, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental,\" resonates deeply with this notion. \n\nIt is this \"something,\" this ineffable quality, that constitutes the most captivating attribute of both art and morality, and it is this transcendental nature that binds them together.  \n\nThe profound impact of morality and art stems from our experience of them on a more fundamental, noumenal level, as Kant would term it. They resonate with us in a way that transcends rational explanation. This connection is particularly evident in literature, as McKean argues, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Contemporary Germany is widely recognized as a powerful and unified nation, boasting a distinct cultural identity that permeates its diverse landscape. From the Bavarian Alps in München to the Baltic Sea city of Kiel, a shared cultural thread binds the nation. This cultural tapestry is evident in Köln, situated on the banks of the Rhine River, and extends to the heart of Germany and the Saxon city of Dresden, nestled along the Elbe. Given this rich and multifaceted heritage, it is not surprising that modern Germany's origins can be traced back to a confluence of various tribes and influences.\n\nThe ancestral homeland of the Germans is known as Germania, a term shrouded in historical debate regarding its etymology.  Tacitus, a prominent Roman historian, proposed that the name derived from a Germanic tribe, the Tungrians, who, prior to crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls, were known as Germans (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to distinguish between the Gauls, whom he had conquered, and the Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often with seemingly ambiguous motives (Caesar, 50-40 BC). Caesar adopted the term from the Gauls themselves.  \n\nWhile the precise origin remains uncertain, some scholars suggest it originated as a neighboring term in the Gaulish language.  In the first chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: \"Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles\" (Caesar, 50-40 BC). \n\nOther theories propose that the name stems from the spear, known as a \"ger\" in Old English (O.E.D, 2010), which was commonly used in Germanic warfare, or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" which alludes to the Germans' reputation for boisterousness (Names of Germany).\n\nThe early Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" which explored the origins of the Germans, stated, \"I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98).\n\nRome, in its pursuit of expansion, sent expeditions into Germania for trade and occasional military campaigns. However, the Romans largely avoided permanent settlement in Germania, preferring to concentrate on their vast empire.  As Germanic tribes emerged in the first century CE, they inhabited the borders of the Roman Empire, exchanging goods acquired from their land and contributing their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "My gaze was fixed downward, my mind struggling to process the scene before me. I observed it with a detached neutrality, a practiced awareness that dissected the image without allowing it to connect with any deeper understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, ephemeral and fleeting. My mind worked with such precision and fluidity that it felt as though I had ceased to think, replaced by a purely sensory experience of what lay before me.\n\nEarlier, encouraged by an artist I had worked with, I had purchased a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\"  A desire to draw had been with me since childhood, and this book promised to teach everything from the fundamentals of using a pencil to the intricate ways the brain interprets lines. One technique it advocated was to frame any subject with an imaginary square, simplifying an intricate scene, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, into a more manageable composition, essentially focusing on the bowl of fruit alone. \n\nAt that moment, staring down at the bowl, I couldn't summon the mental frame the artist had described. I was overwhelmed, captivated by its sheer presence. Picasso had his blue period, Monet his admiration for greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters their vibrant palettes. If I dared to dream of a style of my own, a perspective worthy of the label \"Artistic,\" then this was it, the genesis of my visual narrative, the dawn of \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingertips touched the chosen instrument of my artistic endeavor, muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through the air, translating my thoughts into form in what could have been the most creative act of my life. Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and pure. Particles detached from the whole, carried away into nothingness. Muscles tensed and spasmed, a touch more frantically this time, as my hand slammed against the toilet handle. The offending brown mass refused to budge, stubbornly clinging to the bottom of the bowl.\n\nHolding the mop loosely, feet shoulder-width apart, the green tie constricting uncomfortably around my neck, I furrowed my brow slightly as I surveyed the unappetizing collection of processed organic matter someone had left as a message for those unfortunate enough to clean the bathrooms at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of forced tranquility, then my hand reached for the wall beside me, grasped the end of the toilet paper roll, and began a ritualistic wrapping, transforming it into a grotesque, oven mitt-like appendage. Standing upright, then bending at the waist, my hand descended slowly into the bowl, mimicking the actions of a parent preparing a Thanksgiving turkey...",
            "The issue of teen driving fatalities presents a serious challenge, and it stems from a confluence of factors. Research indicates that the adolescent brain is not fully developed, lacking the maturity necessary to navigate the complexities of driving. Inexperience further compounds this vulnerability, leading to increased rates of fatal accidents, rollovers, speeding, and road departure incidents.\n\nMoreover, the presence of peers in the vehicle significantly amplifies the risk. Studies, such as those conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, have demonstrated a clear correlation between the age of passengers and the likelihood of traffic accidents involving teenage drivers.\n\nIn response, some states, including California, have implemented provisional licensing programs that restrict driving hours and passenger limitations for young drivers. However, these measures are, in my view, temporary solutions addressing only the symptoms, not the root cause. The fundamental issue lies in the statistical reality that young drivers, as a group, are demonstrably less capable of handling the inherent risks and responsibilities associated with driving.\n\nExpert consensus, such as that of psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, suggests that even the age of 18 may be premature for full driving privileges. Zuckerman's research highlights the heightened inclination among individuals under 20 to engage in risk-taking behaviors for the sheer thrill of it. Therefore, delaying driving privileges until this tendency diminishes would seem prudent. \n\nContinued issuance of licenses to young teenagers will inevitably result in a surge in accidents and fatalities, particularly with the impending influx of new teen drivers from the \"Millennial\" generation. \n\nA straightforward legislative approach could address this issue effectively. Driver's education programs in schools could continue to provide foundational knowledge, but actual driving would be prohibited until age 18. Provisional permits could be granted prior to full licensing, contingent upon completion of a specified number of practical driving hours, potentially aligned with existing state requirements such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice.\n\nGiven the widespread nature of these statistics, uniform national legislation on this matter would be a logical and impactful step toward safeguarding young lives across the country.  This proposed approach is not a novel concept; it draws upon existing best practices and aims to mitigate a significant public safety concern.",
            "When exploring the Library of Congress's collection of early Edison films, I chose to examine all fifteen trick films produced between 1895 and 1901. These films primarily rely on innovative editing techniques to create optical illusions. My analysis centered on describing the stylistic conventions prevalent in most of these trick films and identifying the distinctive evolutionary traits present in a few later examples. \n\nGenerally, trick films from the turn of the century are confined to a single set, framed within a frontal proscenium. The camera remains stationary within this proscenium, without panning or following moving figures or objects. This compositional approach, common in early cinema, emerged from theatrical traditions, particularly vaudeville and magic acts. One consequence of this stage-bound setting is that characters in trick films typically move laterally, restricted to side-to-side motion within the frame. They do not progress towards or away from the camera.  Consider, for instance, \"Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel\" (1900). The actors enter from the right side of the screen and move back and forth along a horizontal axis. Even when exiting the frame, the camera does not track their movement.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also influences the shot composition, favoring long shots and occasionally medium shots. Close-up shots are absent from all of the trick films in the Edison catalog. This mirrors the theatrical and vaudeville conventions where the entire performance was visible to the audience at any given moment, framed by the stage boundaries.  As actors rarely move towards the camera, close-up shots are not employed.\n\nMost early trick films adhere to the principle that one conceptual shot corresponds to a film. This convention limits the average length of trick films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricts the narrative or dramatic potential of these films, which primarily focus on short, vaudeville-inspired tricks, such as magic, disappearances, and transformations, with minimal storylines. It's important to note that in a trick film, a single conceptual shot, as perceived by the viewer, may actually involve several individual shots seamlessly joined to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. Examining \"The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\" (1895), one of the earliest trick films, reveals this technique. A closer look exposes the precise moment when the physical shot featuring Mary's severed \"head\" begins, despite the film appearing as a single continuous shot to the audience.",
            "A prominent figure in the early Republican movement, John Taylor of Caroline, was deeply committed to the ideals of individual liberty and limited government. His background in agriculture and brief foray into politics shaped his worldview, solidifying his convictions on these matters. Taylor's belief in the inherent superiority of an agrarian society formed the cornerstone of his political philosophy, influencing his stances on sovereignty, constitutional interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor saw a unique opportunity for the United States to establish an exemplary system of governance. He argued that the absence of entrenched traditions allowed for the creation of a truly self-governing nation. A staunch advocate for natural rights, Taylor believed these rights were interconnected and interdependent; the violation of one jeopardized the integrity of all. He contended that these fundamental rights should be shielded from government encroachment. \n\nTaylor argued that the so-called \"state of nature\" often favored those with physical strength and cunning, leading to an unequal distribution of power. He believed civilization should strive to rectify this imbalance.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor envisioned a government that acknowledged the dualistic nature of human beings, encompassing both inherent goodness and potential for evil. He held firm to his convictions on this binary morality, stating that \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167). He defined virtuous principles as those that protected private property rights, fostered agricultural prosperity, and discouraged excessive commercialization. Taylor believed that a government founded on these principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would inevitably be influenced by self-interest.\n\nWhile acknowledging that self-interest was a fundamental human motivator, Taylor viewed it as morally reprehensible only when it transgressed the boundaries of a society dedicated to the common good, leading to the exploitation of others. He believed a strong government was essential to contain this inherent human vice, but cautioned against the potential for its own corruption.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for a limited federal government with powers explicitly defined within its text. He feared that an expansive federal government would be prone to despotism and financial extravagance. However, he also cautioned against a simplistic, literal interpretation, arguing that it risked misrepresenting the intent of the framers and potentially leading to corruption. Taylor placed greater significance on the Declaration of Independence, viewing it as the true embodiment of the nation's founding principles, as it more clearly articulated the concept of sovereign states rather than a unified nation.",
            "The data presented in Figure 17 reveals a significant decline in commuter log submissions during the project's third month. This downturn was somewhat concerning, and the reasons behind it remain unclear. \n\nThe onset of winter at our New England campus likely contributed to the decrease, as commuting by bicycle or foot naturally diminishes during colder months.  December, coinciding with the end of the fall semester, also saw students and faculty preoccupied with academic demands and holiday preparations.  The importance of logging commutes may have simply slipped the minds of many during this busy period. Furthermore, December marks the start of the holiday season, followed by a month-long break for students and faculty, during which campus attendance significantly decreases.  The low log submissions in January could be attributed to the post-break period, as routines are re-established. However, the low submissions for February remain unexplained.\n\nIt is possible that the project, like many initiatives, experienced an initial surge of enthusiasm that gradually waned. To counteract this trend, we implemented the Carpool Challenge Week in March, a focused campaign aimed at revitalizing participation. This effort was successful in increasing log submissions for that month.\n\nA key challenge encountered was maintaining project momentum amidst natural fluctuations in engagement, compounded by specific factors inherent to higher education, such as semester breaks and holidays.\n\nAnother obstacle faced by this project, and indeed any initiative promoting alternative commuting, is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for individual car use. To encourage participation, a variety of incentives were offered, including gift certificates to local businesses and national retailers.  Exploring the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or electric cars, could have potentially boosted engagement, particularly during periods of decline. The value of prizes remained consistent throughout the project.  However, a strategy of progressively increasing prize value, perhaps announcing bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, might have further motivated participation.",
            "Exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific market index, commodity, or a collection of assets.  Similar to index funds, ETFs offer diversification, but with the added flexibility of trading on stock exchanges like individual shares. This means investors can engage in strategies like short selling, margin buying, and purchasing fractional shares.\n\nWhile ETFs boast lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds, they do come with a trading commission, mirroring the cost structure of stock transactions.  The vast selection of ETFs available further enhances their appeal.\n\nHowever, it's crucial for discerning investors to critically assess the advertised benefits, such as diversification, and determine their actual extent.  To illustrate this, we'll analyze the ETF IHF and compare its performance to its top 10 holdings, which represent a significant portion of its assets. Our objective is to ascertain whether simply owning the ETF provides comparable advantages to holding a diversified portfolio of these individual stocks. We'll also explore if alternative stock combinations within this group could yield a more favorable risk-adjusted return (measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nTo simplify our analysis, we'll focus on the top 10 holdings, which collectively account for 63.58% of the ETF's assets. These holdings are listed below, along with their respective asset percentages.\n\nTo gauge how accurately these ten stocks represent the overall performance of ETF IHF, we can leverage the current asset percentages.  These percentages, normalized to 100%, will be used to calculate the contribution of each stock to the portfolio's Beta and Return, assuming the portfolio consisted solely of these 10 stocks in the proportions held by the ETF. The calculated Beta and Return values for each stock are presented in the following chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio comprising only the top 10 holdings generates a 6.11% higher return than the ETF itself, representing a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the Beta of the top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the entire ETF. These findings suggest that a portfolio consisting solely of the top 10 holdings could potentially deliver a higher return with lower risk. However, it's important to determine if these differences are statistically significant.\n\nTo address this, we'll analyze the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks, normalizing it to 100% to compare its cumulative impact to that of the ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his most accomplished poems.  Within this work, Poe employs the term \"Thulé,\" appearing in lines six and fifty-six, a word that literary scholar Mabbott traces back to the writings of Virgil. Virgil used \"Thulé\" to describe an island situated north of Britain, a place perceived by the ancient Greeks as the furthest reaches of the known world. While Virgil's usage is well documented, it's essential to acknowledge another, more contemporary source that likely influenced Poe. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nA key point of interest arises from this connection to German authors. Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's and Goethe's respective poems, suggesting that Poe may have been inspired by Goethe's work.  The \"Oxford Companion to English Literature\" describes Goethe as a renowned writer whose poetic drama \"Faust\" achieved widespread acclaim. This masterpiece was published in two parts: the first in 1808 and the second, during Goethe's final year, in 1832.  Nestled within the second part of \"Faust\" is a poignant short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This piece centers on a king whose grief-stricken state follows the death of his wife, who had gifted him a goblet. Consumed by sorrow, he drowns his pain in alcohol, haunted by memories of his deceased queen.  He ultimately decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children, except for the goblet.  He then walks to a cliff, tosses the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and takes his own life.  The demeanor of the \"King of Thulé\" and the description of the king in \"Dream-Land\" share striking similarities, potentially reflecting Poe's own personal struggles and reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism.\n\nInterestingly, \"Faust\" was also adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, a year preceding Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\" Notably, Poe employs \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works. While he uses \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he uses \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" framing the poem like a bookend.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be interpreted as companion pieces. In \"Dream-Land,\" the speaker paints a vivid picture of the desolate landscape of Thulé, describing it as dark, lonely, haunted by deceased friends, and devoid of color. These elements resonate with the themes of loss, sorrow, and despair that permeate \"The King of Thulé\" after Goethe's wife's passing.  The entire poem can be seen as a journey into the heart of Goethe's own emotional turmoil.\n\nGoethe's significance in the literary world would have made him a figure of great interest to Poe, especially considering Poe's admiration for Tennyson.  It is well-documented that Poe held Tennyson in high esteem.  Beyond this connection to Tennyson, Poe would have undoubtedly encountered Goethe's works through numerous reprints and adaptations circulating at the time.",
            "The question of whether punitive damages are warranted in a slip-and-fall case, specifically involving an applesauce spill in a California grocery store, presents a compelling legal issue. \n\nA judge would likely hesitate to immediately dismiss Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages. To successfully argue for such an award, Palmer must demonstrate that store manager Paul Martin acted with a deliberate disregard for the potential harm his actions could cause. She must also establish that Martin's conduct was particularly reprehensible.\n\nPalmer's argument hinges on the fact that Martin was informed of the spill twice, choosing to delay cleanup while on his dinner break.  She will likely assert that Martin should have been aware of the foreseeable danger posed by the spill, citing previous instances of customer slip-and-fall accidents at the store. While the argument that Martin's actions were \"despicable\" might be less strong, it is still supported by the number of similar incidents that occurred in 2009, suggesting a pattern of negligence.\n\nThe events leading up to Palmer's fall on October 13, 2009, paint a concerning picture. At 5:00 pm, employee Rich Wayne notified Martin of the spill but was met with the dismissal that Martin was unavailable during his dinner break. Fifteen minutes later, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin to the same hazard, receiving a similar response. Tragically, at 5:30 pm, Palmer slipped and sustained a serious back injury.  \n\nThis incident followed five other slip-and-fall accidents reported at D&D Markets in 2009, raising questions about the store's safety practices. Palmer's lawsuit against D&D seeks both compensatory and punitive damages. The legal team is currently evaluating whether to file a motion for partial summary judgment against the punitive damage claim.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages can be awarded in cases where a defendant's conduct involved \"oppression, fraud or malice,\" even in the absence of a contractual obligation.  The statute defines malice as either intentional harm or \"despicable\" conduct demonstrating a willful disregard for the safety and rights of others.",
            "During my studies at CBC, I delved into the complexities of Islam, engaging in thought-provoking discussions about its nature and perceptions.  The question of whether Islam is inherently hostile remains particularly pertinent in today's world. Observing the media landscape since 9/11, I've witnessed a dramatic shift in portrayals of Islam, transitioning from a predominantly negative perspective to one that veers towards excessive tolerance. This evolution is exemplified by the emergence of a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, whose Muslim heritage sparked neither controversy nor widespread criticism.\n\nThe biography of the Prophet Muhammad presents intriguing contradictions. My prior understanding, shaped by historical accounts, led me to believe that Muhammad was a forceful converter, conquering tribes and imposing Islam upon them. However, the biography portrays him as a martyr, misunderstood and even self-effacing.  People, it suggests, gradually embraced his teachings after witnessing his humility and wisdom.\n\nFurthermore, I noticed striking parallels between the ministries of Jesus and the attributed \"miracles\" of Muhammad. One instance that particularly caught my attention was the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed forty men. This narrative style, I believe, aims to present Muhammad as a humble prophet who relied on truth and divine intervention rather than seeking external validation. However, this approach, while seemingly innocuous, can inadvertently diminish the significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles. It creates a sense of artistic borrowing, potentially undermining the unique identity of Jesus's message.\n\nSeveral accounts in the biography rely on third-party testimonies, raising concerns about their reliability.  The stories often involve a chain of narrators, each relaying information passed down from someone else. While the intention may be to provide corroboration, this reliance on hearsay weakens the stories' credibility and introduces an element of doubt.\n\nUltimately, what troubles me most is the attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – humble, endearing, wise, and gentle. This idealized portrayal clashes with historical accounts that depict a different side to Muhammad's character.  I wonder if contemporary Muslims are fully aware of the complexities and contradictions surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought following Jesus' lifetime presents a fascinating case study. While his original teachings undoubtedly served as a foundation, subsequent developments have led to a divergence from those early beliefs.  \n\nThe modern world, characterized by its progressive inclinations, seems to be driving this shift further. Although traditional viewpoints persist, their influence may not be substantial enough to halt this trajectory. A growing awareness of history within the Christian community suggests a yearning to discern the authentic core of Jesus' message from the doctrines that have accumulated over time. \n\nThis could result in a significant historical reversal, a gradual return to Jesus' original teachings. Imagine a movement gaining momentum, meticulously peeling back layers of accumulated doctrine, as if time itself were in reverse, until only the essence of Jesus' initial message remains.  \n\nThis trend, when it reaches its peak in the United States and Europe, might lead to a resurgence of practices closer to Jesus' era, with a unified approach to faith.  This shift could also see a reduction in the diversity that currently characterizes Christendom, with greater similarities emerging across denominations and regions. \n\nHistory is replete with examples of such reversals. The Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to adopter of Christianity is one striking instance. Similarly, the United States has witnessed a remarkable evolution from a period of African-American slavery to one marked by African-American leadership.  \n\nThis impending reversal in the Christian landscape will likely involve a re-interpretation of Jesus' words, viewing them metaphorically rather than literally.\n\nLooking back in time, we see that Judaism, the precursor to Christianity, held the core theological tenets of monotheism, divinely revealed scriptures, and their authority.  The Jewish population in Roman times was not monolithic, encompassing various groups like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and the majority of common people.",
            "Upton Sinclair's novel, \"The Jungle,\" delves into the inherent flaws within humanity, exposing a society where self-interest reigns supreme. The pursuit of personal gain overshadows any sense of compassion or concern for those less fortunate. This theme is starkly illustrated through the portrayal of factory owners and managers, who prioritize profit above all else.\n\nSinclair vividly depicts the industrial landscape, emphasizing the stark contrast between the imposing factories and the desolate environment they inhabit. The \"line of buildings\" stands \"clear-cut and black\" against the sky, while the \"great chimneys\" spew out \"a river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery underscores the disregard for the surrounding ecosystem and the well-being of those who live in its shadow.\n\nThe callous indifference of the owners extends to their workforce. Driven by an insatiable hunger for wealth, they exploit their employees, forcing them into grueling work conditions and subjecting them to arbitrary layoffs without any form of support. Sinclair's words paint a bleak picture of a system where individuals are reduced to mere cogs in a machine, their lives deemed expendable in the relentless pursuit of profit.\n\nHe highlights the absence of regulations and the powerlessness of the workers, trapped in a cycle of poverty and exploitation. Even the unions, intended to provide a voice for the laborers, become corrupted, exacerbating the plight of the already vulnerable. The workers are left with no recourse, their lives consumed by the harsh realities of Packingtown, a place where they are likened to \"slaves,\" subject to the whims of their brutal and unscrupulous masters.",
            "Authors often employ diverse strategies to evoke specific feelings or perspectives in their readers regarding crucial themes.  The effectiveness of these techniques varies. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of these strategies in his novel, *The Great Gatsby*.  He frequently juxtaposes adjectives and nouns in unconventional pairings to create a particular aura surrounding certain subjects. Additionally, he imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them for the same evocative purpose. Fitzgerald exemplifies this latter technique through his use of color symbolism, particularly gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink.  \n\nWithin *The Great Gatsby*, Fitzgerald constructs nuanced meanings associated with color, notably white/gray and red/pink, which he later employs to elicit specific feelings in relation to significant objects. \n\nThe author establishes a connection between white/gray and uniformity, with white representing a more refined and elevated class while gray connotes age and faded grandeur. Fitzgerald introduces this semantic framework early in the narrative through consistent depictions of both colors. Daisy and Jordan are perpetually adorned in white (8), and this sartorial preference extends to other characters: Nick dons \"white flannels\" (41) at Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine is described as \"powdered milky white\" (30). Notably, the only instances where characters deviate from this white attire occur when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies the meanings associated with these colors by applying them to commonplace objects and settings. As Nick commutes to work, he traverses \"the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). The names of Gatsby's party guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule, and Catherine's apartment is depicted as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a visual representation of uniformity (28). He also describes ordinary individuals and places as white or gray, such as Jordan and Daisy's shared \"white girlhood\" (19), the \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23) in the valley of ashes, the \"gray\" Italian child (26) by the railroad, and the \"gray old man\" (27) selling dogs.\n\nAfter establishing a rich tapestry of meaning associated with white/gray, Fitzgerald strategically employs these colors to symbolize unimportance or conformity in relation to particular subjects. This technique is first evident in Daisy's portrayal. Following a prolonged absence of these colors, Fitzgerald reintroduces them when describing Daisy dressed in \"white\" in \"a little white roadster\" (74), subtly suggesting a shift in her characterization from a complex individual to a more uniform object of desire, something Gatsby yearns for. Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy's reduced individuality through subsequent descriptions, such as the \"gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her appearance in a \"white\" (115) dress before Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County boasts a thriving agricultural sector, largely due to its pleasant, sunny weather. The region is known for a variety of crops, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There's a considerable demand for organic, locally-sourced produce in the San Diego area, with numerous community-supported agriculture programs experiencing long waiting lists.  Organic eggs and dairy products are also highly sought after.  Many organic farms offer visitors an opportunity to engage with their operations through tours and recreational activities such as hiking and birdwatching. This type of operation presents a unique opportunity for landowners to simultaneously benefit from government programs that support sustainable agriculture while enhancing local biodiversity and offering educational programs and recreational experiences, potentially generating additional income.\n\nBeyond its economic potential, organic farming offers several ecological advantages.  By eschewing synthetic chemicals, organic practices promote greater biodiversity among both plants and animals.  However, it's important to acknowledge that organic farming often comes with increased costs.  Labor-intensive methods are required for pest and weed management, as well as soil fertilization without the use of chemical inputs.  Furthermore, organic farming typically experiences higher crop losses compared to conventional methods.  Small-scale organic farms may also face challenges in achieving the same economies of scale as larger operations.  Similarly, practices that benefit wildlife, but are not directly related to organic farming, can also demand more manpower, including activities such as planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, controlling invasive species, and actively managing plant growth to create specific habitats, such as edge habitats or open patches.  These factors highlight the complexities faced by landowners seeking to maximize both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe specific parcel of land under consideration is located near the town of Potrero in unincorporated San Diego County, California.  Spanning 160 acres, it encompasses a mix of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest.  This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, which is part of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. This comprehensive plan, currently under review, aims to protect over a hundred plant and animal species, many of which are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher. Other species are declining and are at risk of becoming endangered, including burrowing owls.\n\nThis region has a rich history, having been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land, historically part of an original homestead patent, likely served as grazing land and/or a source of wood for many decades.  \n\nIn this scenario, a property was selected from a real estate website, and available government programs were researched to determine what options a small-scale farmer might realistically pursue to mitigate costs while preserving a wildlife-friendly agricultural operation.  To illustrate a potential model for success, a nearby organic farm was identified.",
            "The influence of cultural context is undeniably significant in any negotiation. Culture, more than a singular entity, is defined by its complexities and nuances, encompassing both its explicit and implicit aspects. Recognizing that cultures are not monolithic or uniform is crucial, dispelling generalizations like \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating\" as overly simplistic and inaccurate. While acknowledging general cultural trends can be helpful, a negotiator benefits greatly from a deeper understanding of how a particular culture's values and perspectives will shape the negotiation process.  \n\nWhen encountering a new culture, individuals naturally draw comparisons to their own, leading to insights and potential misunderstandings.  Comprehending a foreign culture involves a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical perspectives, societal norms, and even potential biases. Rather than imposing judgments or attempting to alter a culture, a respectful approach involves acceptance and adaptability. This is particularly important in negotiations, especially when a negotiator holds a weaker bargaining position. Demonstrating respect for traditions and beliefs in unfamiliar territory can significantly facilitate overcoming cultural barriers and fostering progress.\n\nCulture extends beyond national boundaries, manifesting itself within organizations as well. Companies often cultivate distinct corporate cultures, influencing aspects like work hours, dress codes, communication styles, and even charitable practices.  Observing these variations, such as contrasting work environments in American companies, highlights the diversity of thought that exists even within a single society. Cultures may appear more homogeneous from an outsider's perspective, but this often masks deeper complexities waiting to be explored.\n\nValues are paramount in understanding a culture, as they provide the underlying motivations and drivers. For example, a culture that prioritizes \"saving face\" or communal harmony will likely influence negotiation strategies, discouraging public confrontations or actions that might bring shame upon individuals or organizations. Conversely, a culture that values assertiveness and a competitive spirit might approach negotiations with a more aggressive stance.\n\nWhile understanding cultural trends is valuable, it's equally important to gather insights into individual negotiators. Building rapport and understanding personal motivations can significantly enhance negotiation effectiveness.",
            "The assertion, \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originating in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, serves as the foundation for St. Anselm's argument concerning the existence of God. This sentiment appears to resonate with another significant figure in our discussion, Thomas Aquinas.  As both theologians grapple with the same fundamental concept – the existence of God – our task is to determine the strength of their respective arguments. For the sake of clarity and brevity, let's assume, for now, that both Anselm and Aquinas are correct in their belief in the God described within the Bible.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison, as their arguments are specifically tailored to this particular understanding.\n\nDespite their compelling points, neither theologian, in my view, offers a fully comprehensive basis for belief in God. \n\nTo illustrate this, let's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection. He posits that because God exists within our comprehension, the very notion of his non-existence is inherently flawed. While his language may be dense and occasionally obscure, the core idea is that the evidence for God's existence lies within our own minds. Anselm suggests that we needn't seek external validation; the truth about God is accessible through introspection and the examination of what we inherently know to be true. This reliance on internal knowledge, lacking demonstrable empirical proof, aligns with the Christian concept of faith.\n\nIn stark contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas champions a purely rational and empirical approach to proving God's existence, rejecting the need for faith. This perspective holds significant appeal for evangelism, as it could potentially attract new followers without requiring them to embrace something unprovable. Instead, logic would serve as the primary persuasive tool. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting God's existence: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the very existence of these phenomena logically necessitates the existence of God.  He uses the analogy of a missing puzzle piece to illustrate his point: even without seeing the missing piece, the incomplete puzzle logically dictates its existence and certain characteristics.",
            "The emergence of an individual who would later be known as Buddha took place in the 5th or 6th century BCE. Throughout his life, he abandoned worldly pursuits and attained enlightenment, leading to the establishment of Buddhism. This tradition, with Theravada Buddhism being its most orthodox branch, is approximately 2,500 years old.  It has evolved substantially since Buddha's lifetime, evident in diverse practices.  For example, in Sri Lanka, a country deeply rooted in Theravada Buddhism, a yearly water-cutting ceremony is observed. Both monks and lay practitioners participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha's teachings not explicitly mentioning any such festivity. These variations extend from outward customs to the core theological principles of the religion.  The Theravada Buddhist community, both in its monastic and lay segments, has undergone doctrinal shifts over time. This transformation can be attributed to a confluence of internal and external factors, both antagonistic and beneficial in nature.\n\nThis discourse will frequently employ specific terminology. The distinction between internal and external forces will be central. An internal force is defined as any influence originating from members of the Buddhasasana, irrespective of their monastic status. Conversely, an external force refers to any influence emanating from individuals outside the Buddhist tradition. A hostile force is any agency seeking to harm or damage the Buddhist community, driven by a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force, on the other hand, is one that neither intends to harm nor assist the Buddhist community, although its actions might inadvertently result in one or the other. These terms will recur throughout the discussion.\n\nInitially, it is crucial to examine the fundamental tenets of Theravada Buddhism—the doctrines that form its core. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma essentially encompasses the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist scriptures. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka holds the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka delves into the metaphysical aspects of Buddhism.  Metaphysical concepts include Anatta (non-self), Dukkha (inherent suffering in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential for ending Sansara, the cyclical journey of death and rebirth, which continues endlessly.  Simultaneously, Sansara will cease, along with lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion), when one achieves enlightenment. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living. For laypeople, there are five precepts: I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not engage in sexual misconduct, and I shall not consume intoxicating substances. Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules. The most fundamental doctrinal principle in Buddhism is the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha—the truth that life is inherently suffering. Second, that attachment is the cause of suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico throughout the 19th century presents a compelling case study in international rivalry. For a period spanning nearly six decades, from 1836 to 1893, these two nations were locked in a complex dynamic marked by conflict and tension, as detailed by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145).  A pivotal moment in this rivalry was the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the United States emerged victorious, acquiring significant territory including Texas and the American Southwest.  \n\nNumerous other clashes punctuated this period, finally subsiding in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War I.  The roots of this rivalry stemmed from a confluence of factors, including fundamental differences in religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests, as argued by Schmitt (1974, p. 30-31). This pattern of border-related rivalry is not unique to the United States and Mexico. As Pletcher (1977) observes,  \"Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems\" (p. 41).  The geographical proximity of Mexico and Cuba to the United States, coupled with their historical opposition to American influence, distinguishes them from other Latin American nations that have generally enjoyed more amicable relations with the U.S.\n\nReligious differences played a significant role in exacerbating tensions between the two nations, a theme that echoes throughout history. Frahm (2001) highlights this point, stating that \"if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy\" (p. 86).  The rivalry between the United States and Mexico, much like the Cold War rivalry with the Soviet Union, involved both ideological clashes and competition for perceived core interests. However, in this case, the ideological struggle revolved around religious beliefs rather than political systems. Underlying this distrust was a legacy of animosity inherited from the colonial era, with lingering resentment between the English and Spanish influencing Anglo-Mexican relations. \n\nDiehl and Goerts (2000) document 17 specific disputes between Mexico and the United States during this 57-year period of rivalry.  These disputes, primarily territorial in nature, often centered on border raids and frontier skirmishes. Banditry and lawlessness on both sides of the border posed a persistent challenge, requiring increased military presence to maintain order.  \n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to diminish as Mexico's economic reliance on the United States grew, and ultimately ended as American ambitions shifted from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico during the late 19th century (p. 109, 110).",
            "A decade and a half ago, a new illness, one I'd never encountered, drastically altered my life. I was a nurse then, a profession I'd chosen for the stability it promised. As a child, I yearned for security, a longing that resonated through my adolescence.  \"Nursing is a safe bet,\" I was often told, \"Always in demand, always people needing care.\"  While my heart yearned for the worlds of science and journalism, I opted for the reassuring path of nursing.  \n\nLife, however, had other plans. At 46, single, and with limited savings, I found myself unable to work due to this mysterious illness. Fifteen years have passed since then, fifteen years spent relying on Social Security Disability.  Today, I possess little that truly belongs to me.  Each day is a struggle, a constant test of my resilience, chipping away at my sense of security and self-worth. Uncertainty permeates every aspect of my life, yet one truth shines through: without the unwavering support of my family and a few cherished friends, I wouldn't have weathered this storm.  \n\nLife inevitably throws curveballs, both large and small.  There are no guarantees, no matter how diligently we plan. Some challenges are simply too immense to face alone.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that reliance on government programs alone isn't the answer.  They are often burdened and faltering.  Instead, I believe in fostering a renewed sense of community, a willingness to support one another and seek help when needed.  Rather than isolating ourselves, we should be building bridges of compassion and mutual assistance.\n\nConservatives often speak of the \"rugged individualism\" that shaped our nation.  Yet, it was not solely individualism that sustained our forefathers during trying times.  It was their shared values of compassion, respect, and resourcefulness that truly propelled them forward.  The pioneers who braved the treacherous journey across the Rockies did not succeed in isolation; they relied on the strength of their collective spirit.\n\nPreparation is crucial, and I, too, am prepared. I have a disaster kit stocked with first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and materials to seal windows against potential threats.  Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods are readily available.  If you have the means, consider self-sufficiency through gardening or preserving food. A wood stove can be invaluable, as long as your living arrangements permit.\n\nBut amidst these preparations, remember the importance of connection.  Get to know your neighbors, build relationships, and create a network of support.",
            "The question of why organisms evolve in the ways they do has long intrigued scientists.  Are there inherent limitations or guiding forces that shape the trajectory of evolutionary change?\n\nDespite D'Arcy Thompson's observation in 1917 that \"Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms,\" recent advancements in mathematical modeling have illuminated certain aspects of mollusk skeletal development, both in terms of growth patterns (ontogeny) and evolutionary history (phylogeny) (e.g., Raup and Stanley, 1981). Our research delves into the potential of mathematical modeling, used in conjunction with experimental studies, to unravel the mechanisms driving the direction and extent of evolutionary-developmental change.\n\nWe employed X-radiographic imaging of Prunum species to identify quantifiable characteristics of their shells. These parameters were then incorporated into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995) to construct models of both hypothetical and actual shell morphologies. By simulating various shell forms, we aim to define the boundaries of possible morphological transformations within the Prunum lineage. These modeling results are being integrated with ongoing experimental and descriptive analyses to gain a deeper understanding of the macroevolutionary processes shaping this group.\n\nA shell can be conceptualized as a tubular structure that traverses a three-dimensional space over time. The revolutions or turns of the coiled shell are termed whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis known as the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand can vary, and a continuous line, the suture, separates each whorl. Typically, the largest whorl is the final one (the body whorl), while the spire encompasses all whorls except the last. The apex represents the tip of the spire, and its opposite end is referred to as the base. The aperture is the opening through which the animal protrudes from its shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. The \"standard\" orientation is the apertural view, with the aperture facing the observer and the apex directed upwards.\n\nCounting whorls involves viewing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the point where the first suture begins. A line can then be drawn to divide the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, estimated to a quarter whorl if necessary.\n\nConsidering a shell as a series of apertures traversing time and space as the animal builds its shell, we can trace the path of the aperture by plotting the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center, along with the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture. This trajectory can be represented both graphically and mathematically. Once a mathematical model is established, we can manipulate parameters to investigate the potential for altering the mollusk's skeletal development.",
            "Indonesia's progress in reducing neonatal and infant mortality rates has stagnated over the past decade.  While the nation is on course to achieve several Millennium Development Goals, such as those related to water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health fall short of the necessary pace to meet the 2015 target.  The factors behind these shortcomings will be explored, highlighting the need to bolster the overall healthcare system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nSignificant strides have been made in ensuring skilled birth attendants are present for deliveries, with 72% of births now meeting this criterion. However, this figure encompasses traditional practitioners, like midwives, who lack the capacity to manage complications during pregnancy, contributing to the high maternal mortality rate attributed to hemorrhage.  Therefore, while this indicator shows improvement, it masks underlying challenges and demands further attention.  Furthermore, the percentage of childhood diarrhea cases treated by healthcare professionals under the age of five has declined, raising concerns.  \n\nData regarding postnatal care remains incomplete, but it is evident that this area requires urgent improvement due to low utilization rates nationwide.  Cesarean section rates remain below expected levels, hovering around 4%. This disparity in Cesarean section rates, with 7% in urban areas compared to 2% in rural regions, underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services.  Access to healthcare appears concentrated in urban centers, highlighting a need for greater geographic equity.  Moreover, there is a significant 27% gap in service utilization between the wealthiest and poorest quintiles, indicating that the poor disproportionately face barriers to accessing healthcare, likely due to out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMoving forward, enhancing neonatal and maternal care indicators necessitates addressing the fundamental issue of service availability.  The question arises: should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or focus on strengthening the overall health system without concentrating solely on pre- and postnatal care?  While program-based solutions appear attractive due to their targeted nature, manageable objectives, and potential for quicker results, they are not without drawbacks.  \n\nConcentrating resources on a single area of the health sector can lead to neglect in other areas, diverting human resources and funding.  The impact of international funding on HIV/AIDS and its subsequent effect on family planning programs serves as a cautionary example.  Furthermore, implementing multiple parallel programs can result in service duplication and a lack of coordination, leading to administrative burdens and increased paperwork for supplies and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the aristocratic class of the era. However, two novels often classified as Victorian, \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights,\" diverge from this conventional mold. Both of these works incorporate elements of mystery and the unconventional, characteristics not typically associated with Victorian fiction. This departure strengthens the characters within each narrative, providing deeper insights into their motivations and emotional complexities.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\":\n\n\"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of firearms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.”\n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\nThese novels frequently employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the content and purpose of these moments vary between the two. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these strange occurrences often reveal hidden aspects of Oliver's inner world, his pain, and his understanding of the reality surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage emphasizes Oliver's lack of control over the unfolding events and the dire state of his health, vividly conveyed through his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him; his senses are numbed as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, which now manifests as a constant and relentless torment linked with fear rather than surprise. This helplessness raises questions about the agency behind Oliver's misfortune, for it was clearly not his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over his destiny, unable to even attempt to influence the outcome of a situation, even when his life is in peril. The selection also suggests a growing sense of defeat in Oliver, as if Fagin's influence has broken him, forcing him to accept his despair and hindering his ability to respond. It is reasonable to assume that, otherwise, Oliver would have made some effort, at least to save himself.\n\n\n\"The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence and short in its fleeting hours.\"",
            "A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to work in an after-school program, providing academic support to elementary school students. While I was comfortable assisting with various subjects, I found my strengths particularly lay in English and reading.  One student, Adrian, a boy I believe was in either third or fourth grade, stood out. He was struggling significantly with reading,  exhibiting a peculiar pattern.  He could pronounce some letters accurately, while others seemed completely foreign to him. This was quite unusual. Adrian was of Latino heritage, as I recall, but he spoke English fluently. We faced challenges until I met his mother.  I was supervising a small group of children while the rest were on a field trip when she arrived.  She didn't speak a word of English, communicating solely in Spanish. My limited Spanish knowledge—I was just beginning to learn—allowed for a basic exchange.  That's when it clicked: Adrian wasn't unable to read; he simply wasn't familiar with the English alphabet. I'm unsure if this realization had a lasting impact on his progress, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the complexities of the language barrier in schools, particularly here in California. It underscores the fact that challenges are not always immediately apparent. Even for a child who speaks English well, reading can present significant obstacles.  It's evident that this issue exists; the question is, what can we do about it?\n\nAdrian's situation had a relatively straightforward solution: English reading tutoring, focusing on the alphabet and pronunciation. However, the needs of children who have limited English proficiency are far more intricate. There's no one-size-fits-all answer.  Dual language programs, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes—none of these approaches, on their own, will fully address the problem. The key lies in a multifaceted approach, combining these strategies effectively.\n\nDual language programs offer a promising solution, not just for children whose first language is Spanish but for all students. Studies have shown that children in two-way bilingual education programs demonstrate superior academic performance compared to their peers.  Despite this, there's often fear surrounding these programs, with concerns about resource allocation and the lack of benefits for the majority of students. However, these concerns are unfounded. If we were to adopt dual language programs as the standard rather than the exception, all children would stand to gain.\n\nThe question arises: should we require all teachers to be bilingual? That would be unreasonable and impractical.  However, I believe there's no reason we can't have dedicated bilingual aides or tutors to support language acquisition.",
            "From childhood, many of us are instilled with the idea of something grander than ourselves, something beyond our grasp. Some seek guidance in religious institutions, while others explore within or question its existence altogether.  Traditions often dictate our initial beliefs, but some actively reject them, clinging to the confines of their own limited perspective. Our values shift and evolve, leading us on a personal journey to define our spiritual selves.  We yearn for illumination, a guiding light to navigate the darkness and embrace the light of understanding.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird. We were seated on our porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a steady backdrop to our conversation. The overflowing gutters channeled the downpour, drenching the plants lining the edge of the porch. He gazed out into the rain, his expression a mix of introspection and reminiscence.  I noticed how his frame had become more slender, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame.  His hair, once fuller, was now thinner, more sparse than I remembered.  He kept his eyes fixed on the rain, avoiding my gaze.  A profound sense of loneliness, fear, and helplessness washed over me, making it impossible to articulate my impending grief.  \n\nInstead, I reached out and embraced him, settling back into my chair and drawing closer to his side. We sat together, united in our silent contemplation of the falling rain as twilight descended.\n\n\nMy father's life ended in December of that year, just five days after my twenty-second birthday. The treatments, though prolonging his existence beyond the doctors' expectations, failed to alleviate his suffering. I struggled to comprehend the purpose of extending his pain. \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I questioned, alone in the darkness.  Prayer felt pointless, as if any divine presence had long since ceased to hear my pleas.\n\nWitnessing his final moments felt unbearable. I chose not to be present, unable to bear the sight of life's inevitable end. It was my father's essence, his vibrant life, that I wanted to remember, not the fragility of his passing. I knew him better than anyone else, surpassing even his family in my understanding. I was certain he wouldn't desire his only child to be a passive observer at his death. I retreated into the sanctuary of my bed, curling into a ball for three days, waiting for the news.\n\nBut no one contacted me.",
            "The concept of the Gothic novel presents a curious paradox, as literary scholar Ian Watt aptly describes it in his work, \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" It's a genre that has been simultaneously criticized and celebrated, dismissed for its perceived lack of depth and lauded for its evocative power, particularly its ability to tap into a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke).  Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" often recognized as the first Gothic novel, skillfully blends elements from both \"ancient\" and \"modern\" romances to establish a new literary form. Walpole himself utilizes  traditional theatrical conventions alongside a more contemporary focus on the natural world, a technique he labels \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic genre draws heavily on medieval Gothic themes, evident in its theatrical elements, architectural motifs, and cultural references. Even at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto\"'s publication, the term \"Gothic\" had already acquired a wide range of associations, often perceived as antiquated or simplistic in comparison to the perceived advancements of the modern era. However, it is this very juxtaposition—the theatricality of the Gothic combined with the novel's ability to offer a more intimate exploration of character psychology—that has ensured its enduring appeal, allowing it to remain both timeless and strangely contemporary for readers separated from its origins by vast expanses of time.\n\nOne recurring motif in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry. The medieval ideal of knighthood, the rigorous training that shaped a knight, is both preserved and reinterpreted in Walpole's seminal work. Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic writers because it embodied the archetype of the heroic knight: brave, honorable, and competent. This ideal, which many Gothic writers, particularly Walpole, believed had been lost in contemporary society, became a source of longing and a benchmark against which to measure the perceived shortcomings of the present. Through their use of chivalric ideals and conventions, Gothic writers romanticize the \"Gothic past,\" hinting at the genre's future evolution towards Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a way to elevate and potentially improve the present.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of significant political turmoil and personal accusations, may have felt a sense of despair about the future.  His writing reflects a yearning for a simpler, more morally upright era, a time when the inherent \"goodness\" of humanity, as exemplified by the chivalric code, was more pronounced. This sentiment is evident in characters like Frederic. Even before his introduction, the reader is presented with a character imbued with chivalric traits:\n\n [Insert the description of Frederic as provided in the original text here]\n\nThis description is replete with traditional chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has suffered tragedy and is presumed to have been killed by infidels, embodies many of the classic attributes of the gallant and courteous knight. However, as with many Gothic tropes, this ideal is exaggerated, introducing an element of excess that would become a hallmark of the genre (66).",
            "Supply chain management refers to the intricate network of processes involved in bringing goods from initial customer demand to their final destination. \n\nThis concept, coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, emphasizes the importance of planning, executing, and overseeing every stage of the supply chain to ensure customer satisfaction through efficiency and speed.\n\nSix fundamental elements underpin a robust supply chain: production, procurement, inventory management, location strategy, transportation, and information flow.  By skillfully managing these elements, businesses can deliver exceptional customer service.\n\nProduction, the cornerstone of the supply chain, involves defining the \"who, what, when, and where\" of goods creation. Understanding customer needs is paramount, and analyzing market trends provides valuable insights into demand.  Based on this analysis, managers determine which products to manufacture and in what quantities.  \n\nLocation selection for production is crucial, considering factors like production volume, quality standards, and proximity to customer markets.  Concurrent with this, managers prioritize scheduling production workloads and ensuring equipment maintenance. Production's meticulous planning is essential; any oversight can lead to costly delays and inefficiencies.\n\nTake, for instance, my experiences at retail giants like Walmart and Target. Both companies meticulously document every aspect of their operations, from employee uniforms to receiving shipments. These standardized procedures ensure smooth workflows and minimize confusion.\n\nThe second key element, supply, encompasses strategic decisions regarding a facility's core capabilities and the selection of outsourcing partners.  \n\nA single product might have multiple production divisions, each with distinct equipment, personnel, and expertise. Managers must strategically allocate production to the most suitable division based on the product's specific requirements. Outsourcing can also be a strategic choice, often driven by the need to enhance velocity – the ability to deliver quality, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.",
            "A peculiar sign, held aloft by actress Ellen Page, known for her role in the film \"Juno,\" draws the eye on a bustling street corner. Scribbled in Sharpie on cardboard, the message reads: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\"  This unsettling statement prompts a reflection on the situation in Burma, officially known as Myanmar, a Southeast Asian nation grappling with a long-standing military dictatorship. \n\nThe current regime, which seized power in a coup in 1962, has a history of suppressing dissent. In 2007, a wave of protests, dubbed \"The Saffron Revolution\" for the saffron robes worn by the leading Buddhist monks, erupted across the country. Initially peaceful, the demonstrations escalated into a violent clash between the monks and the military.  \n\nThe crackdown drew international condemnation. Journalists, including a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai, were detained and, in Nagai's case, tragically killed while covering the unrest.  While the official death toll remains disputed, a defected military officer claimed the true figure to be far higher.\n\nThis tragic episode in Burmese history sadly echoes a recurring theme throughout human history: the struggle against oppressive regimes. From ancient Roman emperors who claimed divine right to rule to modern-day dictatorships, the desire to control and silence opposition is a persistent challenge to freedom and human rights.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, where Chinese citizens gathered to demand political reform, serve as a stark reminder of the consequences of such suppression. Estimates of the casualties vary widely, with official figures vastly lower than those reported by independent sources. Similarly, the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, fueled by ethnic hatred and government inaction, resulted in the systematic massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus.  \n\nThe atrocities of Nazi Germany, with its systematic extermination of Jews and other persecuted groups, stand as a chilling testament to the depths of human cruelty and the dangers of unchecked power.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the jazz genre is significantly rooted in his prolonged career and, consequently, his remarkable ability to mold his orchestra. While his piano presence might be understated in several of the compositions chosen for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his creation of intricate and layered pieces that highlighted the individual talents of his musicians. He meticulously crafted a framework that allowed soloists to freely express themselves while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically catered to the unique styles of individual band members, thereby illuminating musical concepts in a distinctive manner. This approach also served to emphasize the orchestra's overall tone, resulting in cohesive and original soundscapes that perfectly complemented each composition. Ellington's mastery over the individual voices within his ensemble, as well as their collective synergy, empowered him to produce some of the most groundbreaking and masterful works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music Dictionary, when discussing Ellington's innovative sound, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as an example of his consistent use of voice \"as a jazz instrument\" throughout his career. This early composition exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating vocal textures and colors without relying on traditional lyrical content. \"Creole Love Call\" also showcases Ellington's aptitude for complementing the styles of his soloists, a characteristic that permeates his entire body of work. This gradual, deliberate twelve-bar blues piece unfolds over six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between voice and reeds, commencing with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions into a more raspy tone towards its conclusion.\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the fundamental melody and accentuates several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo performed in a high register, accompanied by a subtle syncopated piano interlude.\nChorus 4: The full band echoes the first chorus, engaging in a call-and-response exchange between the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus, where the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by a rhythmic \"stop-time\" backdrop provided by the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response between voice and reeds. In this instance, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, assuming the role of a solo instrument.\nTag: A brief concluding section featuring a vocal flourish and a dissonant, unexpected ending delivered by a trombone.\n\nEllington's strategic employment of voice to enrich the tonal palette of this piece exemplifies a stylistic trait that pervades his entire oeuvre.\n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his talent for precise orchestration with his keen sense of tonal color.  A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing ingeniously merges the vocal qualities of Miley's trumpet playing with the instrumental aspects of Cox's voice, resulting in a harmonious and complementary sound. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" further expands upon these concepts, as Ellington skillfully utilizes Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington's orchestra, to deliver the melody on muted trombone with remarkable impact.",
            "From a young age, she felt a persistent yearning, a void that seemed impossible to fill. This dissatisfaction first emerged around the time she turned fourteen, during the tumultuous transition into adolescence. Three years later, at seventeen, the feeling remained, now morphing into a desire for companionship rather than material possessions. However, no boys captured her interest. Though some showed interest in her, their attempts at courtship were met with indifference. She often pondered this peculiar phenomenon, trying to unravel the cause of her uncharacteristic apathy towards romance. Years of introspection yielded several theories, but none were convincing enough to warrant serious consideration. Thus, she carried on with her life, perpetually questioning her own desires.\n\nHer family life was typically tranquil. Her parents were amiable and composed individuals, rarely clashing with each other. Disputes with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their only disagreements stemmed from her assertive nature and independent spirit, which often contrasted with their calm demeanor. Though they were a remarkably peaceful pair, she possessed a vibrant and outgoing personality, making her both likable and endearing.\n\nHowever, this day was anything but ordinary. As she wandered through the house, seeking inspiration for her own pursuits, a sudden cry pierced the air. It was her mother's voice, filled with distress, emanating from the kitchen. Her heart pounding, she rushed to the room, her voice laced with concern, \"Mom! Mom, what's wrong?\" There she found her mother lying on the floor, writhing in pain, her gasps punctuated by pained groans. Rushing to her side, she gently touched her mother, offering comfort and support. \"Ouch...sweetheart, I...need you to take me to...the hospital,\" her mother's words were strained and fragmented. The urgency in her voice left no room for doubt; she was in excruciating pain. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up,\" she replied, her voice steady despite the fear threatening to engulf her. Her mother guided her hands, and in that moment, the daughter, a product of her own physical training, felt a surge of gratitude for her strength. She carefully lifted her mother, laid her gently in the backseat of the car, and drove towards the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a sensory overload: the sharp scent of disinfectant mingled with the metallic tang of fear and illness. Yet, her anxiety was overshadowed by her determination to help her mother. She swiftly carried her mother inside, calling for medical assistance. Several worried faces gathered around, a rolling bed was swiftly brought, and her mother was gently laid upon it. They rushed her away for immediate treatment, leaving her daughter to sit in anxious contemplation.\n\nIt turned out her mother had fallen from a step stool while reaching for a vase from the highest cabinet.",
            "This research investigated the relationship between adherence to a dietary pattern similar to the Mediterranean diet (referred to as the \"alternate Mediterranean\" or aMed diet) and the risk of developing chronic heart disease (CHD), stroke, and stroke-related deaths. The aMed diet emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting animal products and saturated fats. It also encourages moderate alcohol consumption.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a connection between following a Mediterranean diet and a reduced risk of both total and cardiovascular mortality. One trial even demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these studies hadn't focused specifically on stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed a group of 74,886 women aged 38 to 63 who were part of the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study tracking the health of over 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. These women had no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.  Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers assessed their adherence to the aMed diet using detailed food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) completed six times. These questionnaires were designed to pinpoint the types and amounts of food consumed in the previous year.  Validation studies ensured the accuracy of the FFQs.\n\nInformation about the women's health was obtained through medical records, hospital records, autopsies, and death certificates. Some cases, particularly strokes and nonfatal heart attacks, were classified as \"probable\" based on self-reported information, as complete medical records weren't always available.  The researchers also gathered data on factors like body mass index, smoking habits, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and hormone therapy use. Starting in 1986, they also assessed the women's levels of physical activity.\n\nTo account for variations in individual dietary patterns and better reflect long-term eating habits, researchers calculated cumulative averages of the aMed diet scores from the repeated FFQs. These averages were based on combining scores from the two preceding years. To ensure the findings weren't skewed by other factors (confounders), the researchers adjusted their analysis for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, multivitamin intake, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nStatistical models called Cox proportional-hazard models were used to determine the link between the aMed diet score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke cases.\n\n\nThe study found a clear association between a higher aMed diet score (indicating greater adherence to the Mediterranean-style eating pattern) and a lower risk of developing CHD and stroke in these women. During the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 cases of CHD, 1763 cases of stroke, and 1077 deaths from cardiovascular disease (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were recorded. Women in the highest aMed quintile (meaning their diet most closely resembled the aMed pattern) had a significantly lower risk of both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a pivotal moment in American history, witnessing the nation grapple with a severe financial crisis. Unemployment surged, the housing market experienced a dramatic collapse, and numerous prominent corporations faced imminent ruin. The repercussions of this economic downturn continue to be felt today, prompting a crucial inquiry: What factors contributed to this crisis, and how can we prevent its recurrence?\n\nAt the heart of the crisis lay a confluence of political decisions that prioritized short-term gains over long-term stability. These policies, driven by a desire to promote lending and economic expansion, encouraged banks and financial institutions to extend sub-prime loans to borrowers with questionable creditworthiness. This practice, coupled with a financial system that lacked adequate safeguards and oversight, created a volatile environment ripe for disaster.\n\nEnter Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises tasked with facilitating the housing market. Under pressure to expand access to homeownership, they were incentivized to purchase and repackage these sub-prime mortgages into complex financial instruments known as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) and Credit Default Swaps (CDSs). This intricate web of interconnected financial products obscured the underlying risks associated with these risky loans.\n\nWhen borrowers began defaulting on their mortgages at an alarming rate, the financial system teetered on the brink of collapse. Banks, burdened with vast amounts of mortgage debt, faced a liquidity crisis. The repercussions rippled through the interconnected financial markets, infecting institutions that had invested in CDOs and CDSs, ultimately leading to a widespread loss of confidence and a crippling credit freeze.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown several years earlier, during the Clinton administration's push for increased homeownership. In an effort to boost his re-election prospects, President Clinton relaxed lending regulations, creating an environment where sub-prime mortgages proliferated.\n\nThis loosening of lending standards, coupled with the intricate and opaque nature of mortgage-backed securities, created a perfect storm that ultimately culminated in the 2007 financial crisis. The consequences were devastating, leaving millions unemployed, homeowners facing foreclosure, and the global economy teetering on the edge of recession.",
            "Exposition. That word can strike fear into the heart of even the most seasoned writer. It's the point in a story where you, the author, can either soar to new heights of literary brilliance or plummet into the abyss of reader boredom.  \n\nThink of it this way: exposition is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's a necessary tool for setting the stage, introducing characters, and establishing the world your story inhabits. On the other hand, it can quickly become a drag if overdone, leaving your readers longing for something, well, more exciting.\n\nYou've probably heard the golden rule of writing: \"Show, don't tell.\" But even seasoned writers can fall into the trap of exposition overload. It's that inner voice whispering, \"Just get the backstory out there so we can get to the good stuff!\" But remember, readers don't just want the bare facts; they want to experience the story alongside your characters.\n\nImagine you're reading a story, and the hero's past is laid out in a long, descriptive paragraph. You learn about his childhood, his loves, his losses, his every waking thought – all in a matter of sentences. It's like being bombarded with information instead of being drawn into the story organically.\n\nInstead, consider weaving those details into the narrative itself. Let the characters reveal themselves through their actions, their dialogue, their interactions with others. Show us the hero's love for his wife through their tender moments together, or hint at his past struggles through his guarded demeanor. Let the readers piece together his story, just as they would in real life.\n\nTake the example of a new character, a former Air Force pilot turned gas station attendant.  Instead of simply stating his facts, show us his military background through subtle clues: a worn dog tag, a slight tremor in his hand, a distant look in his eyes.  Reveal his dreams of owning the gas station through his interactions with the customers, his meticulous care of the pumps, his quiet contemplation during slow nights. \n\nRemember, exposition is a tool, not a crutch. Use it sparingly, strategically, and always with the goal of enriching your story and engaging your readers.",
            "My attention was drawn to a couple of news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011. The first, a live report from NBC 4, covered the unfolding story of a stabbing in Ashley, Ohio. The suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed. While details were limited - something to the effect that the victim, whose name was withheld, had been stabbed multiple times -  the incident was reported with appropriate brevity given its developing nature. \n\nThe following segment focused on a shooting that had occurred earlier that morning in the Sharon Woods area. Travis Buyers, an 18-year-old, was critically injured, and the investigation was ongoing with no leads or suspects at the time. The SWAT team was reportedly involved.\n\nThis story felt somewhat abbreviated, and a thought occurred to me: could the brevity be linked to the fact that both the victim and the neighborhood were predominantly Black?  I've noticed a pattern in media coverage where crimes involving minority victims often receive less attention compared to those involving white victims.  Kidnappings, missing persons, or violent crimes against white individuals tend to dominate news cycles, while similar incidents affecting minority communities often receive minimal coverage.\n\nThe next story shifted gears to a different type of incident: a gunshot hole found in a Med-Flight helicopter.  The location of the incident and the suspected caliber of the weapon used (a .22 caliber rifle) were discussed, and Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nA brief weather segment followed, providing a preview of the weekend's predicted thunderstorms and temperatures.\n\nThen, a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was reported.  Details about the suspect, described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, were provided, including his height and weight. The emphasis placed on his race and skin tone struck me as unusual.\n\nThe final story of the broadcast covered Rene Rodriguez, a convicted drug kingpin from Texas who had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for his involvement in a marijuana distribution ring operating between Texas and Ohio.  Interestingly, instead of stating the sentence as 25 years, they used the numerical equivalent, \"300 months.\"  The reason for this choice was unclear, but it seemed somewhat noteworthy. Additionally, his Hispanic ethnicity was mentioned, which I found to be somewhat tangential to the main narrative.",
            "The relationship between brothers is complex, woven from an intricate tapestry of emotions.  Love and pride exist side-by-side with jealousy and even cruelty, a unique blend found nowhere else.  Brothers possess an understanding that transcends ordinary bonds, a mirror reflecting their own souls back at them. This profound connection is most vividly revealed in moments of crisis, revealing its inherent duality—capable of both remarkable strength and devastating darkness.  The weight of these emotions, both positive and negative, carries significant consequences. Truly understanding the nature of this fraternal bond means grappling with the repercussions of these feelings. Looking into a brother's eyes is not simply seeing another person; it's gazing into one's own reflection, unfiltered and raw. It's within their actions and the inevitable outcomes of those choices that their fundamental character is laid bare.  \n\n\"The Scarlet Ibis\"  explores this intricate theme, delving into the tumultuous emotions that accompany it. Set against a backdrop of lush beauty, two young brothers embark on a journey fraught with futility. Their quest culminates in a poignant clash of bitter disappointment and intense pride, leaving only one brother to bear the weight of survival. The story's exploration of the theme unfolds through the direct characterization of Doodle, the protagonist, and their evolving relationship.  The narrative voice further amplifies this exploration, offering a glimpse into the protagonist's complex emotional landscape and their perception of the world around them—influences that profoundly shape their actions.\n\n\nThe protagonist's behavior is driven by a single, dominant emotion: pride. From their initial forays into the world together to their final, fateful adventure, resentment simmers beneath the surface of the protagonist's interactions with Doodle.  He yearns for a brother who can be his partner in all endeavors, someone to share his skills and experiences with. He envisions a brother who can keep pace with him, someone to race with, to climb trees, and to explore the hidden corners of their world.  \n\nDoodle's physical limitations shatter these dreams.  Born with a weak heart, Doodle's future seemed precarious at best, his participation in the protagonist's imagined adventures impossible. The blow to the protagonist's dreams was profound, leaving him grappling with anger and even contemplating unthinkable acts against his younger brother.  However, Doodle's innocent smile evokes a flicker of tenderness within the protagonist, revealing a deep-seated affection that undermines his darker impulses. This suggests that the protagonist's initial resentment was perhaps not absolute, overshadowed by a fundamental, albeit suppressed, love for his brother.",
            "The human brain operates as a complex system, dedicated to processing and generating creative outputs.  As technology has progressed, our understanding of the brain has also evolved, reflected in the evolving metaphors used to describe its function. Early comparisons likened the brain to simple storage devices like wax tablets or papyrus scrolls. Later, the analogy shifted to the book, and most recently, the computer.  However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful, have limitations and can sometimes lead to misconceptions about how the brain truly works.\n\nThe journey of information through the brain begins with its reception by our sensory organs. These organs convert external stimuli – sensations like touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrochemical signals.  The brain then processes this sensory information through a series of intricate steps, employing both \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" approaches.  Imagine viewing a picture of a black box on a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes the fundamental elements: color, shape, and boundaries. By piecing together these basic elements, the brain determines that you are seeing a box.  Top-down processing, on the other hand, utilizes prior knowledge and expectations to expedite this recognition. In this case, your understanding of what a \"box\" is helps you quickly identify the object, distinguishing it from a hole in the background.\n\nOnce information has been processed to a certain extent, a sophisticated filter, known as attention, determines its significance and directs it towards relevant cognitive processes.  For example, while your brain registers every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, your attention filter prevents you from consciously noticing each one individually.  Conversely, your name, even amidst a bustling environment, will likely capture your attention.  This intricate process of information processing and modulation by attention occurs in multiple stages.\n\nTo function effectively, the brain requires a system for storing information. This involves various types of memory: sensory, working, and long-term. The initial stage is encoding, where information is transformed into a format suitable for storage. Different types of sensory input are encoded in distinct ways. For example, verbal information can be encoded structurally (based on its appearance), phonemically (based on its sound), or semantically (based on its meaning). Once information is stored, it must be maintained.  Studies on animals suggest that working memory, which holds information for about 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical signal circulating through a specific group of neurons.  Long-term memory, on the other hand, is theorized to be maintained through the structural organization of certain proteins.\n\nNumerous models have been proposed to explain how knowledge is organized within the brain. These models draw upon insights from human memory recall, computer science, and neurophysiology. One prominent model is the semantic network model, which posits that knowledge is represented as nodes, each representing a concept. These nodes are interconnected based on their relationships. For example, in a semantic network, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which in turn could be linked to \"wooden,\" and so on.",
            "In Aldous Huxley's dystopian masterpiece, \"Brave New World,\" the author explores the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement and its close ties to a capitalist system. The novel paints a chilling picture of a society where individualism is sacrificed for the sake of collective harmony, and citizens are conditioned from birth to prioritize instant gratification above all else. \n\nExamining the work through the lens of Marxist theory reveals Huxley's deep-seated anxieties about the emerging economic order of his time. Terms like \"homogeneity\" and \"reification,\" central to Marxist thought, resonate throughout the narrative, suggesting that Huxley saw these societal trends as inherently flawed.\n\nHuxley masterfully satirizes capitalism through the concept of \"false consciousness,\" a Marxist idea that describes the manipulation of the working class into accepting their subordinate position. In \"Brave New World,\" the citizens are so preoccupied with their immediate desires, fueled by relentless consumerism, that they remain blind to the true power dynamics at play. The lower castes, Delta and Gamma, for instance, are practically devoid of independent thought, their desires shaped by the insidious power of hypnopædia, a sleep-learning technique used to instill a thirst for consumption. This control is orchestrated by the World Controller, who embodies the oppressive force of the ruling elite.\n\nThe novel vividly portrays \"hegemony,\" a Marxist concept where one social class dominates others, leaving the lower classes unaware of their exploitation. The citizens of \"Brave New World\" unquestioningly embrace the system, \"buying into\" an ideology that perpetuates their own subjugation. The upper classes, though aware of the manipulation, remain complicit, accepting their privileged position without challenge.\n\nThe novel further explores the corrosive effects of capitalism on human relationships.  The characters, even those deemed central to the plot, lack depth and individuality. Perhaps Huxley suggests that the relentless march of technology and capitalism ultimately strips individuals of their free will and capacity for genuine connection. Love and emotional depth are absent; interactions are superficial and driven by materialistic desires. The focus on physical appearance, particularly in the way males regard females, highlights the reductionism inherent in a consumerist society. \n\nThe citizens' unquestioning acceptance of their social hierarchy mirrors Marxist notions of the proletariat, who are falsely reassured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume and conform. Their unwavering obedience to their designated roles within the social structure serves as a stark commentary on the potential dangers of unchecked capitalist systems.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating this campus, like many others, can pose a challenge. During my freshman year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center.  Journeying from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in locations such as Willard building, nestled near the campus core, often took 25 minutes on foot, particularly arduous when confronted with the frequent inclement weather State College is known for.  Through conversations with an alumnus, not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago, the East Halls complex was isolated from the rest of the institution by vast expanses of undeveloped land. Today, this once-empty space has been transformed into a vibrant hub of activity, featuring sports fields, imposing new structures like the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of residential apartments. As our campus continues to expand, traversing its sprawling grounds becomes increasingly intricate. What then, is the most effective solution to this mobility dilemma?  In the context of a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a compelling answer.\n\nHowever, the bicycle alone cannot single-handedly resolve this issue. Student adoption and a campus infrastructure designed to accommodate cyclists are essential.\n\nRecently, I engaged in a discussion with a friend who had recently resumed cycling after a multi-year hiatus. He expressed surprise at why he ever stopped, stating, \"Bikes are superb; for a while, it wasn't considered fashionable to ride, but it's undeniably the most practical means of getting around.\" Beyond its physical benefits, cycling offers unparalleled efficiency. A simple bowl of oatmeal and a moderate amount of exertion can propel you over 30 miles. Like numerous undergraduates, I now reside off campus, a distance from the campus center comparable to some residence halls. The most astute decision I've made this year was acquiring a bicycle. Every day, I attend classes in Thomas building, a location at least a 25-minute walk from my home. Cycling significantly reduces this travel time to a mere 5 minutes, provided I maintain a brisk pace. The only drawback is that Pollock Road, the most direct route from my residence to Thomas building, is not always a smooth journey, whether on foot or by bike. While there are merits to walking, my schedule leaves little room for it. Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole reliable option for reaching my classes. Commuting to Thomas on foot daily would consume an additional 30-40 minutes, amounting to over two and a half hours each week.  Factor in the time required for walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, and it becomes clear that walking is simply not feasible."
