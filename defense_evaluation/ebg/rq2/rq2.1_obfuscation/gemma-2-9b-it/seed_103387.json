            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My passion for social work stems from a deep desire to champion the well-being of children facing adversity, particularly those who have experienced abuse or neglect. I envision myself working within the Division of Family and Children Services, providing vital support to both vulnerable children and their families navigating challenging times.  The core values that I bring to this field – service, respect, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships – are not merely professional ideals; they are deeply ingrained principles that guide my personal life as well.\n\nMy journey towards social work began with a lifelong yearning to make a positive impact on the world.  During my high school and college years, I observed how some individuals struggled to cope with their problems, resorting to unhealthy or unproductive methods. Witnessing these struggles solidified my desire to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. While my initial goal was to understand human behavior, I wasn't certain about a specific career path. A pivotal experience occurred during a summer break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009.  A friend introduced me to a troubled teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. This encounter sparked a profound realization within me.  Driven by a desire to help, I reached out to the boy's parents, offering my support and sharing my educational background. Although the situation highlighted the limitations of legal intervention, it ignited a passion within me to pursue a career where I could directly advocate for children in need.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply with me.  As a society, we often celebrate individuality while simultaneously promoting conformity. This apparent contradiction raises questions about our true commitment to embracing uniqueness. I believe in challenging social norms and advocating for equality for all. Throughout my academic years, I actively participated in protests and demonstrations against injustice, expressing my individuality through my appearance, associations, and unwavering support for marginalized communities.  \n\nMy passion for social justice fuels my commitment to making a tangible difference in the world.

            "This examination explores the biological and sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The biological model concentrates on inherited genetic predispositions and medical health factors. Conversely, sociocultural models investigate the influence of environmental factors like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status on sleep patterns. This analysis delves into these models, examining selected research to illuminate their intricacies and provide a comprehensive understanding.  Each study's findings are critically assessed, highlighting both strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders arising from external factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias, characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS).  Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve abnormal behaviors or physiological events during sleep, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders associated with mental health conditions are often linked to either Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, with some exploration of broader primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, inherited traits, and physiological factors in sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in controlling sleep-wake cycles. A study utilizing mice models revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and sleep induction.  The administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that the mouse model can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Dysfunction or absence of this receptor could potentially disrupt sleep patterns, requiring medication for adequate rest.  From a sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep regulation, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep, potentially impacting various aspects of life, including academic performance, career success, and daily activities requiring focus and sustained attention.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  Firstly, it provides a concise definition of the disorder.  Next, the diagnostic process is outlined, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the document concludes by offering strategies that teachers in inclusive classroom settings can implement to support students with CAPD. \n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005) defines CAPD as the perceptual processing of sound within the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that drives this processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. Essentially, it's a condition where the brain struggles to properly process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\"  The challenge lies in the brain's ability to translate sound, differentiating words and separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest mention of this disorder, then known as \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were studying children with communication disorders. An Italian research team, composed of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing tests for these children in 1954. Building upon this work, Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961, formulating a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways.  Individuals with CAPD may have difficulty localizing sounds, distinguishing between auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm based on tone. They might experience auditory blocking, where one sound obscures the preceding one, and may struggle to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information. Additionally, they may have difficulty determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests.  Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other qualified professionals utilize a variety of measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This assessment may encompass questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli.  Currently, there is no single, universally accepted test for diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers.  More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",

Ultimately, individuals face a difficult choice: preserving their authentic selves or maintaining relationships with others who may be negatively impacted by the revelation.  \n\nWhile some might react neutrally to uncovering a deception, others could experience offense or resentment. The play delves particularly into the complications of gender role reversal as a form of disguise, raising questions about the motivations behind such a choice. In Viola's case, her assumption of a male identity, \"Cesario,\" is driven by a need for self-preservation in a foreign land. As she states, she seeks refuge with a \"captain\" who aided her in a past situation (\"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249)). \n\nHowever, this strategy isolates her from female companionship, severing a crucial support network.  Furthermore, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads to Olivia's infatuation, creating a complex web of mistaken identities. Olivia's declaration, \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,\" (5.1.138) highlights the confusion and unintended consequences of Viola's disguise.  Additionally, Viola grapples with her own suppressed feelings for Orsino, who expresses his admiration for her: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261).\n\nWhile this might appear progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a reflection on how deception can expose hidden emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters harbor unexpressed desires, brought to the surface by the presence of Viola/Cesario. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario rooted in his perceived masculinity, or does it reveal a deeper, unexamined inclination towards women?  One could argue that Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, coupled with her eventual acceptance of Cesario/Viola as family (\"A sister, you are she,\" (5.1.315)), suggests she is more likely satirizing the superficial judgments prevalent in her era.",
            "German colonial rule is remembered for its harsh realities, particularly the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa.  However, such a vast empire cannot be reduced to a single narrative. The German colonial experience was as multifaceted as its geographical expanse, encompassing a range of policies and governing styles. Educational initiatives across the colonies mirrored this diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant population of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German educational efforts.  Contemporary accounts also lauded German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies. \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government established public schools and actively participated in the education of the indigenous population, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely entrusted to missionary societies, albeit with limited government support. The German government, however, did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support and oversight for missionary institutions. These contrasting educational policies had enduring consequences for South West Africa, extending even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by formal education, with the vast majority of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate. A confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly by examining new research on the perspectives and attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous African population.\n\nA substantial body of literature explores education within the German colonial empire.  Most of these sources are in German and originate from the early twentieth century, spanning the period of and immediately following German colonial rule.  Early works primarily focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across the various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems implemented in different colonies.  The most prominent work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and investigates the factors contributing to the observed differences.  Cohen posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, though much of the territory is characterized by arid desert.  The European population of South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the last century has resulted in a vast and constantly expanding array of genres. Pinpointing an exhaustive list proves challenging, as most, if not all, established genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous subgenres and sub-subgenres. Among these, the subgenre of heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive forms of popular music in the past four decades.  \n\nIts expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, often leaning towards the more somber and intense ends. The genre's diversity is evident in its early iterations, where musicians quickly recognized its inherent flexibility and began to experiment, creating unique subgenres that in turn gave rise to even more specialized offshoots, a trend that continues to this day.\n\n\nThe heavy metal movement has reached a point where the sheer number of niche groups makes it difficult to define precisely what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from various other genres, yet its origins remain significant. To truly appreciate the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the nature of the heavy metal movement itself, understanding why it transcends the confines of a simple genre categorization.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement characterized by a distinct darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatrical elements.  It moves away from primitivism, emphasizing technical proficiency; metal musicians are renowned for their mastery of their instruments, a quality that shines through in their music.  Metal is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement deeply intertwined with drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s fueled a sense of experimentation and pushed musicians to create unconventional and otherworldly sounds, often attributing their creations to the influence of these substances.  It possesses visceral and often dark qualities that were relatively novel to the music scene at the time, as much popular music lacked such a connection to the darker emotional spectrum.  Later generations of metal artists have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements that were prominent in the Romantic era. Lyrics such as those found in \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify this inherent darkness:\n\n  \n\nThese lyrics, showcasing a darker side of The Beatles, evoke a sense of emotional turmoil and instability, possibly reflecting the influence of drug use. Considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of heavy metal, it was a direct response to a heavier, more intense Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their own capacity for power and intensity, including this track on their iconic \"White Album.\"",
            "Long before the Surrealists painted their dreamlike canvases, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist artist, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" depicts not just a woman awestruck by the wonders of her dreamland, but also reflects Rousseau's personal aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. Yet, he grappled with a significant internal conflict in pursuing this ambition.  \"The Dream\" stands as the embodiment of Rousseau's lifelong struggle: to either conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance within the art world he deeply admired, or to forge his own unique path, embracing creative independence.\n\nTo truly understand \"The Dream\" through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, a town in northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau's father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer (Shattuck 47). Despite his upbringing, Rousseau received no formal artistic training. Instead, he worked for the French municipal toll service, earning him the nickname \"gabelou,\" until the age of forty (Shattuck 46).  Tragedy struck when his first wife, Clémence, passed away, followed by the loss of eight infant children, leaving him with only his daughter, Julia, and profound grief (Shattuck 49).  Seeking solace and a new beginning, Rousseau turned to painting as a source of comfort and inspiration. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau, a true folk painter, captured the hopes and dreams of the everyday person.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance within the art world is understandable when viewed in this context.  Not only was he self-taught and began his artistic journey later in life, but he also emerged during a time when many talented and established modern artists were gaining recognition. While he had been painting for years, Rousseau's work only began to receive widespread acclaim around the same time as Matisse's rise to prominence. According to Jan Gordon in \"Modern French Painters,\" although they were artistic rivals,  Matisse and Rousseau differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting.  Gordon writes, \"Matisse feared painting in a trite manner, while Rousseau aspired to paint in such a conventional style that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Throughout history, many brilliant minds have observed a profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting an underlying bond between truth and beauty.  I concur with this notion, believing there's a fundamental reason for this pairing.  John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" eloquently captures this sentiment: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often acquire knowledge through formal education or personal experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional methods.  Both fields, as Keats implies, resemble attempts at description rather than prescription. Our explorations into morality and beauty primarily aim to decipher the reasons behind a work's artistic merit or an action's ethical implications, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nFurthermore, any critique of art or morality ultimately falls short of fully grasping the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty.  Consider the Mona Lisa, a masterpiece by da Vinci.  Discussions about its value might revolve around elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, yet these factors fail to fully elucidate its artistic excellence. When asked about a cherished work of art or literature, individuals often express a sense of ineffable quality,  preceded by phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" before elaborating further. I propose that both art and morality resist complete reduction to a mere description of their attributes. Flannery O'Connor aptly states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how comprehensively we analyze the characteristics of a literary work, an intangible element remains, defying complete articulation.  I believe ethics shares this inherent quality.  As Wittgenstein observes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"  It is this elusive \"something,\" this indefinable essence, which I posit as the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This transcendental nature of both fields, I argue, forms a bridge connecting them.\n\nThe profound connection between morality and art stems from the fact that we experience both most powerfully on a  noumenal level,  a concept borrowed from Kant.  They resonate with us on a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This link intensifies when considering the art form of literature.  As McKean eloquently states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its cultural tapestry woven from the alpine heights of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel.  A singular spirit pervades from the banks of the Rhine in Köln, stretching through the heart of the country to the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Given this unique cultural blend, it's no surprise that the Germany we know today has roots in a multitude of diverse sources and ancestral tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germanic peoples, holds a name shrouded in historical debate. Scholars and historians alike grapple with its origins. Tacitus, in his historical writings, attributed the name to the Tungrian tribe, suggesting they were previously known as \"Germans\" before crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often under questionable motivations (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  He borrowed this word from the Gauls themselves, utilizing it as a marker of distinction. While the precise meaning remains elusive, some propose it originated from a Gaulish term for a neighboring people.  In the opening chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles” (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories posit that the name derives from the \"ger,\" the spear used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" suggesting a boisterous or vocal people (Names of Germany).\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" explored the origins of the Germans, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nThe Romans, for their part, held limited interest in Germania. While they ventured into Germanic territories for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely confined their presence to the periphery of this wild and untamed land. The Germanic tribes, meanwhile, flourished along the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods acquired from their lands and contributing their skills as soldiers within the Roman legions (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I lowered my gaze, my mind attempting to process the scene before me. It was a detached observation, devoid of strong emotion. I analyzed the picture with a practiced eye, yet it remained an abstract image, failing to spark any deep understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, appearing and disappearing in rapid succession. My mind worked with such fluidity and precision that it felt as if I was merely experiencing the visuals, rather than forming my own thoughts about them.\n\nOnce, an artist I collaborated with suggested I read a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I'd always wanted to learn to draw, ever since I was a child, and this book promised to teach everything from the fundamentals of using a pencil to the intricate ways the brain interprets lines. One technique it emphasized was using a square frame to isolate a specific area within a complex image. Instead of being overwhelmed by intricate details, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, the artist could focus on the simpler essence—just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface.  \n\nAs I stood before the bowl, however, I couldn't mentally construct that frame. I was completely captivated, lost in awe. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters embraced a vibrant palette. If I harbored any artistic aspirations, this scene felt like the beginning of my journey, the start of my own story—a work I envisioned as \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers brushed against my chosen instrument of creation, my muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, transforming my mental intention into physical form. It felt like a potentially pivotal moment in my creative life. The water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Fragments of matter detached themselves, carried away into nothingness. My muscles tensed again, twitching and spasming with a growing sense of urgency. My hand slammed down on the toilet handle once more. The offending brown package stubbornly refused to budge, clinging to the bottom of the bowl like a tenacious slug.\n\nHolding a mop loosely in my hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, a green tie feeling uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned slightly as I stared at the unpleasant collection of processed animal and plant matter that someone had left as a message for the unlucky bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand reached for the wall beside me. Grasping the end of the toilet paper, I began wrapping it around my hand, transforming it into something resembling an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a parent reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey…",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among teenagers highlights a critical issue demanding immediate attention.  Various factors converge to create this dangerous trend, with the National Institutes of Health identifying the immaturity of the adolescent brain as a significant contributing factor.   \n\nIn addition to developmental factors, inexperience plays a crucial role.  Studies, such as one conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, demonstrate a direct correlation between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents, underscoring the heightened risk associated with teenage driving, particularly when accompanied by peers. \n\nEfforts to mitigate this issue, such as provisional licenses with restricted driving hours and passenger limitations, represent temporary solutions.  The underlying problem lies in the inherent challenges faced by young drivers in adequately managing the complexities and responsibilities inherent in operating a motor vehicle. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, through his research cited in USA Today, suggests that even the age of 18 may be too young for full driving privileges, citing a prevalent inclination among individuals under 20 to engage in risky behavior for the sake of thrill-seeking.\n\nDelaying driving until this propensity for risk-taking diminishes could prove beneficial.  Failing to address this issue will likely result in a catastrophic surge in fatalities as the next generation of drivers, the \"echo boomers,\" reach driving age within the coming years.\n\nA straightforward legislative approach could involve continuing driver's education programs while prohibiting individuals under 18 from operating motor vehicles.  A provisional permit system could remain in place, coupled with a mandated number of supervised driving hours, mirroring the requirements of many states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. Because the alarming statistics affecting teen drivers are prevalent across the nation, uniform national legislation would be a logical and potentially effective measure to safeguard young people nationwide. \n\nThe proposed legislation is not unprecedented.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s historical film collection, I became fascinated by a group of early Edison films classified as “trick films.”  This collection, encompassing fifteen films from 1895 to 1901, primarily relied on innovative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis focused on identifying the common stylistic elements found in the majority of these films, while also examining the unique characteristics that emerged in a few later examples.\n\nA defining feature of the trick film at the turn of the century is its restricted setting. These films were typically confined within a frontal proscenium, meaning the camera maintained a fixed position and did not move to follow characters or objects. This composition, drawing inspiration from both theatre and vaudeville, often resulted in limited movement within the frame, with figures primarily moving side-to-side rather than towards or away from the camera.  A prime example is the film “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel” (1900), where actors enter from one side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis, remaining within the confines of the proscenium even as they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictated the camera’s framing, favoring long and occasionally medium shots. Close-up shots were entirely absent in these early trick films. This mirrored the theatrical tradition, where the audience would observe the entire performance within the established boundaries of the stage.  \n\nFurther reinforcing this theatrical influence, most early trick films adhered to a strict “one shot equals one film” approach. This convention limited the length of most films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricted the narrative possibilities, as most trick films focused on short, vaudeville-inspired tricks such as magic, disappearances, and substitutions, rather than developing complex storylines. However, it is important to note that the concept of a “shot” in these films might not always align with a single physical take. A single “shot” could potentially be composed of several individual takes spliced together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For instance, a closer examination of “The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots” (1895), an early trick film, reveals the moment where the physical shot of Mary’s severed “head” begins, despite the film being presented as a single, continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the principles of Republicanism, emerging as a prominent figure in its early days. Though his background was primarily agricultural, his experience in this field and his brief foray into politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering commitment to individual liberty and limited government. His dedication to agrarian ideals served as the foundation for his political beliefs, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution's interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor envisioned the United States as possessing a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of governance. He believed the absence of deeply rooted traditions allowed for the creation of a government truly reflective of the people's will. A strong believer in the inherent rights of individuals, he asserted that these rights were interconnected and mutually dependent. He argued that if one right were infringed upon, all would be weakened, diminishing their overall value. These fundamental rights, in his view, should exist beyond the reach of governmental control.  He contended that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and cunning, leading to an imbalance of power.  He believed that in a civilized society, this dynamic must be rectified.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor proposed a government structure that acknowledged both the inherent goodness and potential for evil within human nature. He held firm to a dualistic view of morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167).  He defined good principles as those safeguarding private property, promoting agricultural progress, and discouraging the excesses of capitalism. He believed that a government grounded in these principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would inevitably be influenced by self-interest.  He viewed self-interest as a fundamental human motivator, but deemed it detrimental when it superseded the common good and led to the creation of self-serving sub-societies that exploited others. A well-designed government, in his opinion, was essential to contain these inherent human flaws and prevent the erosion of ethical principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, believing in a limited federal government with powers explicitly defined within its text. He recognized that an expansive federal government could become tyrannical and fiscally burdensome. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, arguing that without considering the intentions of the Founding Fathers, such an approach could lead to unforeseen and potentially harmful consequences. Furthermore, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, emphasizing its portrayal of the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single, unified entity.",
            "The data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a significant decrease in commuter log submissions during the project's third month, a trend that raised concerns.  Several factors could have contributed to this decline. The transition to winter in a New England setting likely impacted commuting patterns, particularly those relying on bicycles or walking. December, coinciding with the end of the fall semester, saw students and faculty consumed with academic demands and holiday preparations, potentially leading to a decline in log completion.  Additionally, the month-long winter break further minimized the need for campus presence, potentially causing log submissions to fall off.  The low number of logs in January, despite the resumption of classes, remains unexplained.\n\nIt is possible that the initial enthusiasm surrounding the project naturally waned over time, a common challenge for such initiatives.  To counteract this, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign was implemented in March, aiming to re-energize participation and successfully resulting in an increase in log submissions. This highlighted the importance of maintaining project momentum, navigating both general engagement fluctuations and the unique challenges posed by academic calendars and extended breaks.\n\nA fundamental obstacle for any alternative commuting program is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for automobile independence.  To encourage participation, a variety of incentives, including gift certificates to local businesses and national chains, were offered.  Exploring the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or electric cars, could have further motivated engagement and potentially mitigated the project's observed dip in participation. While the existing prizes proved sufficient initially, increasing their value throughout the project, perhaps by adding bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, might have yielded greater results.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to index funds. However, ETFs offer greater flexibility, trading like individual stocks on stock exchanges.  \n\nETFs provide the diversification advantages of index funds while also allowing investors the benefits typically associated with individual stocks, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractions of a share.  \n\nWhile these advantages are highly appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.  However, it's important to note that trading ETFs incurs a commission, similar to buying or selling individual stocks.\n\nFurthermore, the ETF market boasts a wide array of options, catering to diverse investment strategies.  Even with these clear benefits, it's prudent for discerning investors to critically assess whether the advertised advantages, like diversification, are truly realized and to what extent.\n\nThis analysis will focus on ETF IHF, comparing its performance to the top ten holdings that constitute a significant portion of its assets.  The goal is to determine if owning a single ETF like IHF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks.  Additionally, we will explore whether alternative stock combinations within this group could potentially yield a more optimal return for a given level of risk (as measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nExamining every holding within the ETF would be cumbersome, so we will concentrate on the top ten holdings, which collectively represent approximately 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. \n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent ETF IHF as a whole, we will leverage their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return.  This assumes the portfolio were composed entirely of these ten stocks in the same proportions as held by the ETF.  The calculated beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings generated a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF itself.  \n\nBased on these preliminary findings, a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings appears to offer both higher returns and lower risk (as indicated by the lower beta) compared to the ETF.  However, it's essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.  \n\nTo address this, we will determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his superior poetic works. Within the poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" on two occasions, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by scholar Mabbott. Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost edge of their known world. While Virgil's usage is well-documented, another influential source should be acknowledged. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nThe inclusion of \"Thulé\" highlights Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's poem and Goethe's verse, suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from the German master.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe's death in 1832.  Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a poignant short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This piece revolves around a king who, after his wife's death, descends into heavy drinking and mourning.  Overwhelmed by grief, he ultimately decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children except for a goblet, a memento of his deceased queen. He walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and takes his final breath. The character of the King of Thulé shares striking similarities with the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own experiences with loss and reliance on alcohol. \n\n Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just prior to Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works. While he employs the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he utilizes \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" acting as bookends for the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as companion pieces, with Poe's poem seeming to step directly into the emotional landscape of Goethe's work. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a desolate Thulé, plagued by darkness, loneliness, and the haunting presence of deceased friends, a world devoid of color. These elements resonate with the emotional turmoil of the King of Thulé, who, having lost his wife, grapples with profound loneliness and a loss of purpose.\n\nGoethe's literary significance would have ensured Poe's familiarity with his work, particularly given Poe's admiration for Tennyson, who was influenced by Goethe. Moreover, numerous reproductions of Goethe's works circulated after their initial publication, further exposing Poe to his writings.",
            "The question of whether a customer injured in a California grocery store from an applesauce spill could receive punitive damages hinges on the actions of the store manager.  \n\nLegally, a plaintiff seeking punitive damages must demonstrate the defendant's conduct was not merely negligent, but rather exhibited a deliberate indifference to the potential harm their actions could cause. This means proving the defendant acted with malice, which in this context, could be characterized as intentional misconduct or, in the absence of intent, a reckless disregard for the safety of others. \n\nIn this case, Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages might be successful. She could argue that the manager, Paul Martin, knew of the potential danger posed by the uncleaned spill, given prior incidents of similar accidents at the store. His alleged disregard for these past incidents and his prioritization of his dinner break over customer safety could be presented as evidence of a willful and conscious disregard for the well-being of shoppers. \n\nThe strength of Palmer's claim rests on establishing the manager's actions as not just negligent, but demonstrably malicious. While the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 is compelling, proving the manager's state of mind and  conscious disregard for the risks will be crucial to securing punitive damages. \n\nThe timeline of events is significant. On October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin, however, dismissed their concerns, stating he was on a dinner break and unable to address customer issues.  Tragically, an hour later, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. This incident occurred amidst a pattern of previous slip-and-fall incidents, further strengthening Palmer's argument that Martin was aware of the potential dangers and chose to ignore them.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages are awarded in cases where a defendant's conduct meets a high threshold of culpability.  It is for the court to determine if Martin's actions rise to this level of malice, taking into account all the evidence presented.",
            "My exploration of Islam began nearly four years ago during a course at CBC. One of the most compelling discussions we had centered around the perception of Islam – a question that feels even more crucial in today's world. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a significant shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents in America, transitioning from a state of hostility to an almost overwhelming embrace.  It's hard to imagine, just over two decades ago, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his family's undeniable Muslim heritage, even being conceivable.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography captivated my attention. My prior understanding of his history painted a picture of a figure who forcefully converted individuals and subjugated tribes through military conquest. However, the biography presented a different narrative, portraying Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr, a figure who humbly engaged with others and invited them to embrace his teachings. This contrast intrigued me, as it challenged my preconceived notions.\n\nFurther comparisons between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's documented \"miracles\" also sparked my curiosity.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a multitude of people. This narrative style, emphasizing Muhammad's humility and reliance on divine guidance, led me to question whether it aimed to present him as a more relatable figure, somewhat akin to Jesus.\n\nWhile I found this approach intriguing, it also raised concerns for me. The emphasis on Muhammad's supposed miracles, while well-intentioned, seemed to diminish the unique and unparalleled significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles. It felt as if certain aspects of Jesus's story were being subtly appropriated.\n\nThe biography also presented numerous accounts of individuals converting to Islam independently, supposedly providing evidence of its truth. However, many of these accounts relied on hearsay, recounted through multiple intermediaries. This reliance on second-hand information, while intended to lend credibility, ultimately diminished the stories' impact and introduced a sense of uncertainty.\n\nPerhaps my most significant discomfort stemmed from the biography's attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – humble, wise, gentle, and endearing. This portrayal clashed with my understanding of historical accounts, which depicted a more complex figure. It left me wondering if modern Muslims are fully aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought after the life of Jesus presents a fascinating study. While the beliefs and teachings attributed to him formed the foundation,  the path Christianity took diverged significantly from its origins.  Contemporary society, marked by a heightened awareness of progress and change, is witnessing a shift in religious landscapes.  Traditional viewpoints, though persisting within certain segments of the population, might not hold sway over the broader trend. \n\nLooking towards the future, a growing awareness of Christianity's historical development is anticipated. This will likely fuel a desire to distinguish the doctrines that emerged over time from the core principles espoused by Jesus.  This process, though potentially spanning decades or even centuries, suggests an inevitable trajectory: a return to the essence of Jesus' message.\n\nImagine a movement gaining momentum, gradually peeling away layers of accumulated doctrines, much like a clock rewinding.  This could lead to a return to a purer form of Christianity, focused solely on the teachings attributed to Jesus himself.  As this trend takes hold in regions like the United States and Europe, it could reshape religious practices and beliefs,  bringing a renewed emphasis on the simplicity of Jesus' original message.\n\nThis shift, however, might not result in a decentralized or fragmented religious landscape.  Rather, the theological pendulum could swing towards greater uniformity.  Denominational and regional differences might gradually diminish, culminating in a more unified expression of Christian faith.  History offers numerous examples of such reversals, from the Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to adopter of Christianity to the evolution of societal attitudes towards race and equality.\n\nThe success of this envisioned reversion hinges on a reinterpretation of Jesus' words, viewing them through a metaphorical lens rather than adhering to a strictly literal interpretation.  What, then, transpired between Jesus' lifetime and the present day?\n\nTracing the origins of Christianity, we encounter Judaism, from which it emerged.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established itself as a monotheistic religion, with a divinely inspired scripture and a strong sense of religious authority.  While united in their core beliefs, the Jewish population was not monolithic, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people coexisting within its midst.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" presents a stark and unsettling portrait of human nature, suggesting that at its core, humanity is driven by greed and self-interest. This inherent flaw is starkly illustrated through the actions of the factory owners and managers who prioritize their own success above all else. Their relentless pursuit of profit manifests in a callous disregard for the well-being of their employees and the environment. \n\nSinclair vividly depicts the industrial landscape as a menacing force, \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery emphasizes the environmental devastation wrought by the factories, a consequence that the owners seemingly ignore.  The disregard for human life is equally apparent in their treatment of their workforce. They exploit their employees, demanding excessive hours and offering little protection or support. This exploitation is further highlighted by the quote: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"\n\nThe absence of adequate labor laws during this period allowed the owners to operate with impunity, treating their workers as expendable pawns in their quest for wealth.  The workers, trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and desperation, are left to fend for themselves amidst the harsh realities of Packingtown.  Their plight is further compounded by the failure of unions to offer meaningful assistance. In fact, Sinclair portrays these organizations as contributing to the problem, enriching themselves at the expense of the very people they supposedly represent.  The desperate circumstances faced by the working class are compared to slavery, highlighting the dehumanizing nature of their exploitation.  Sinclair states, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Authors often employ various literary devices to guide readers' emotions and perceptions of key themes. The effectiveness of these techniques can vary greatly. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of such strategies in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\" One notable approach involves pairing adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to evoke a specific ambiance surrounding a subject. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them to achieve a similar effect.  He skillfully employs this latter technique with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald meticulously constructs meaning associated with these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to trigger specific emotional responses in readers concerning significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with a sense of uniformity, with white connoting a certain elegance and refinement, while gray suggests a faded, antiquated quality. This association is established early in the novel through frequent depictions of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white\" (8), a common attire for all characters—Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine appears \"powdered milky white\" (30). The sole exception to this monochromatic palette occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies these color associations by applying them to commonplace objects and settings. As Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). At Gatsby's gatherings, the names of guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). Even ordinary individuals and places are rendered in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" by the railroad track is depicted as \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is characterized as \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established a clear semantic framework for white/gray, Fitzgerald strategically employs these colors to signify insignificance or uniformity in relation to specific subjects. This technique is notably employed in his portrayal of Daisy. After an extended period devoid of significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; this visual cue subtly transforms Daisy's perception from a distinct character into a more uniform, almost generic entity, representing an object of Gatsby's desire and longing (74).  Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy's homogeneity through additional instances of white and gray: \"a gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural prowess stems from its pleasant, sun-drenched climate.  A variety of crops thrive here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The area boasts a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture products, with numerous local organizations facing extended waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, alongside opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational pursuits.  This type of agricultural model presents a unique opportunity for landowners to capitalize on government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat, thereby fostering recreational use and creating avenues for farm tours and educational programs, potentially generating income or serving educational purposes.\n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in both plants and wildlife. This is due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming practices can come with higher costs compared to conventional methods.  Intensive labor and management are required to control pests and weeds, and to fertilize the soil without chemical inputs. Consequently, losses are frequently greater in organic farming compared to conventional approaches.  Furthermore, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.  Practices beneficial to wildlife, but unrelated to organic farming, can also add to labor costs. These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, managing invasive species, and actively shaping plant growth to create specific conditions, such as edge habitat or patches of open ground.  These factors highlight the reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise in maximizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen parcel of land is located adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It encompasses 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, as defined by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan.  Although the plan is currently under review, it already recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species that inhabit the area.  Many of these are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may face endangerment in the near future, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis region has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land, part of an original homestead patent, likely served purposes such as grazing and/or wood production for many decades.  \n\nThe selection of this property was based on research conducted on a real estate website. I then explored available government programs to understand the realistic options a small farmer might consider for cost mitigation and wildlife conservation.  As a model of potential outcomes, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The impact of cultural context on negotiation cannot be overstated.  Culture, a complex and multifaceted concept, is defined as much by its absences as its presences.  It resists simplistic categorization, defying neat labels and generalizations. Statements attributing uniform traits to entire nationalities, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are inherently reductive and ultimately unhelpful. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be a starting point, a truly effective negotiator delves deeper, understanding the specific cultural nuances relevant to the negotiation at hand and how they might influence the dynamics at play.\n\nEncountering a new culture inevitably involves personal reflection, as we naturally frame our experiences through the lens of our own cultural background. This can lead to comparisons, but it is crucial to avoid imposing our own cultural assumptions onto the situation.  \n\nComprehending a foreign culture or mindset requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical analysis, an awareness of its potential biases, and a willingness to approach it with open-mindedness.  Rather than seeking to judge or alter it, the key lies in acceptance and adaptation. Within the context of negotiation, particularly when facing a weaker bargaining position, respecting and working within the boundaries of another culture becomes paramount.  Navigating unfamiliar territory requires sensitivity to local traditions and beliefs, which can serve as bridges to overcome cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt's important to recognize that cultural influences extend beyond national boundaries.  Within any given nation, companies often cultivate their own distinct corporate cultures.  These cultures manifest in various ways, from work hours and dress codes to communication styles, delegation practices, and even philanthropic initiatives. The diversity of American corporate culture, ranging from demanding work environments to more relaxed settings, even within regions and urban versus suburban contexts, highlights the richness and complexity of cultural expressions.  While some cultures may appear more homogenous on the surface, this can be misleading, often masking a deeper layer of internal diversity.\n\nValues serve as the driving forces behind cultural behaviors, providing the \"why\" behind actions. Understanding these values is crucial in negotiation. For instance, a culture that prioritizes saving face or communal harmony might discourage public confrontations or criticism to avoid jeopardizing harmony. Conversely, a culture that values aggressive negotiation tactics might be less inclined to settle quickly.  \n\nWhile acknowledging these broader cultural tendencies is essential, a successful negotiator also benefits from gaining insights into their counterpart's individual values and motivations on a personal level. This personalized understanding can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation process.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. This very phrase serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of a higher power. Notably, this belief also resonates with another prominent figure, Thomas Aquinas, whom we will be analyzing.  \n\nSince both of these thinkers are defending the same concept – the existence of God, specifically the God depicted in the Bible – and our aim is to determine the strength of their respective arguments, we will, for the sake of clarity, assume they both hold this belief to be true.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison, as their arguments are fundamentally built upon this specific understanding.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge that neither argument ultimately provides a complete or irrefutable foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection in attaining knowledge of God. He posits that because God exists within our comprehension, we cannot fully grasp the idea of his non-existence. While his presentation can be dense and occasionally ambiguous, the core idea is that the proof for God's existence resides within our own minds.  Anselm suggests that we needn't rely on external evidence to discover truth about God; rather, the existence of this being is inherently known through what we inherently understand to be true within ourselves. This concept, often referred to as faith, involves accepting truths that lack concrete empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes a different path – one that relies entirely on reason and observable evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous for spreading religious belief, as it would allow individuals to be persuaded by logic alone, potentially broadening the appeal to those who might be hesitant to accept concepts that cannot be empirically proven. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the existence of God is logically necessary. He uses the analogy of a missing puzzle piece: even though we haven't directly observed it, the presence of the remaining pieces logically necessitates the existence of the missing one.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince who later became known as Buddha was born. His life journey led him to renounce worldly possessions and achieve enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada being its most traditional branch. This ancient religion, spanning roughly 2,500 years, has evolved significantly since Buddha's time.  \n\nThis evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Both monks and lay followers participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha not having explicitly mentioned such a celebration. These changes range from external practices to the very core tenets of the faith. \n\nOver time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines. This transformation can be attributed to both internal and external influences, some positive and others negative.\n\nIn this discussion, we'll frequently use specific terms to clarify our points. \"Internal\" refers to forces originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while \"external\" refers to influences from non-Buddhist sources.  \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community due to negative perceptions of Buddhism. \"Benign\" forces, on the other hand, have no intention of harming or aiding the community, though their actions might inadvertently lead to one or the other. These terms will recur throughout our analysis.\n\nTo begin, we'll examine the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"Triple Gem\" – the Buddha, the Dhamma (Buddha's teachings), and the Sangha (the monastic community). The Dhamma is essentially represented by the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures: the Sutta Pitaka (containing discourses), the Vinaya Pitaka (containing monastic rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (containing metaphysical teachings). These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and achieving enlightenment. Along with ending Sansara, one also transcends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) when enlightenment is attained. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living, with five precepts for lay followers (non-killing, non-lying, non-stealing, non-sexual misconduct, and non-consumption of intoxicating substances). Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules.\n\nThe most foundational principle in Buddhism is the concept of the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha – the reality of suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome. And fourth, there is a path to overcome suffering – the Eightfold Path.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico offers a compelling case study in the dynamics of interstate rivalry.  From 1836 to 1893, these two nations were locked in a protracted conflict, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). This period witnessed its most intense phase in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the United States emerged victorious, annexing Texas and the American Southwest.  Numerous other skirmishes ensued, finally subsiding before the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThe roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental differences between the two societies, encompassing religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests (Schmitt, 1974, pp. 30-31). This pattern of neighborly rivalry is not unique to the United States and Mexico.  Bordering nations often find their interests converging and diverging, leading to tensions and strained relations. Pletcher (1977) observes that the United States has faced enduring diplomatic challenges with Mexico and Cuba, both geographically proximate and historically adversarial (p. 41). In contrast, other Latin American nations have generally maintained amicable ties with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also played a significant role in dividing the two nations, a recurring theme throughout history.  Frahm (2001) highlights how, while Americans in the 20th century opposed fascism and communism, in the 18th and 19th centuries they were wary of Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86).  Echoing the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, the conflict with Mexico involved both ideological differences and competition for vital interests. However, in this instance, the ideological struggle centered on religious preferences rather than political systems.  \n\nThis distrust had its origins in the historical antagonism between England and Spain, whose colonial legacies cast a long shadow over relations between the United States and Mexico.  Diehl and Goerts (2000) catalogue 17 disputes between the two nations during this 57-year period, the majority stemming from territorial issues, including border raids and incursions. Banditry and outlaw activity from American border towns posed a persistent threat until both nations deployed military forces along their shared frontier (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico's economic dependence on the United States grew (p. 109), ultimately culminating in a shift in American interest from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico by the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected turn. An illness, unknown to me until then, brought my active life as a nurse to a sudden halt.  Nursing was a career choice I made as a young person, driven by a deep-seated need for stability and security, something I hadn't experienced growing up.  The advice I often heard was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\"  Though my true passions lay in science and journalism, perhaps a blend of both, the practicality of nursing seemed like the safer route.\n\nAnd yet, here I was at 46, single, with limited savings, and facing an uncertain future due to my disability. Fifteen years on Social Security Disability have left me with very little to call my own. Each day is a struggle to maintain my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing feels certain anymore.\n\nHowever, there is one truth that shines through: I wouldn't have survived these years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of dear friends.  No matter how strong I thought I was, facing a real crisis exposes the fragility of our human strength.\n\nLife is unpredictable. Emergencies, both big and small, are inevitable.  No matter how well we plan, some challenges are simply too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nI agree that we shouldn't solely rely on government assistance. It's clear that our current system has its flaws. Instead, I believe Americans need to rediscover the importance of community and mutual support. We should learn to trust each other, to offer help when needed, and to ask for help when we're struggling.  \n\nConservative rhetoric often glorifies \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our nation. However, the pioneers who traversed the rugged terrain of the American West didn't succeed through isolation. They thrived because of compassion, mutual respect, and the shared responsibility of looking out for one another.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit stocked with first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and even plastic sheeting and duct tape for potential emergencies. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods are all part of my preparedness plan.  If you have the means, consider growing your own food or learning preservation techniques.  A wood stove can be a valuable asset, though this might not be feasible for everyone. \n\nBut remember, preparedness isn't solely about gathering supplies. It's also about building strong connections with your neighbors.",
            "The evolutionary trajectory of organisms presents a compelling question: what factors guide their development? Though D'Arcy Thompson mused in 1917 that even the simplest life forms remain elusive in mathematical description,  modern science is striving to bridge this gap. Mathematical modeling has found application in understanding the broader aspects of mollusk skeletal development, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981).  Our research seeks to explore how these models, coupled with experimental investigations, can illuminate the mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in the genus *Prunum*.  \n\nUtilizing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantifiable parameters that form the basis for modeling both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). Through this, we constructed hypothetical shell morphologies, aiming to define the boundaries of possible morphological variation within *Prunum*. These findings are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain deeper insights into macroevolutionary patterns within this lineage.\n\nThe mollusk shell, in essence, can be conceptualized as a tube traversing a three-dimensional space over time. The revolutions or turns of this coiled structure are known as whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis termed the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand varies, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called the suture. Typically, the largest whorl, known as the body whorl, represents the final stage of shell growth. The spire, encompassing all whorls except the last, culminates in the apex, the tip of the spiral. In contrast, the base refers to the opposite end. The aperture, an opening, provides an exit for the animal inhabiting the shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards, is the most common orientation.\n\nDetermining the number of whorls involves visualizing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, with estimations made to a quarter whorl.\n\nViewing a shell as a sequence of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell provides a unique perspective. By tracing the path of the aperture using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a graphic and mathematical representation.\n\nThis mathematical formulation allows for the modification of parameters, enabling us to explore the potential variations in mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "The trends in neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. Despite the nation's progress toward achieving several Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have fallen short of the targets needed to reach the 2015 goals.  A deeper examination reveals the multifaceted reasons behind these shortcomings, suggesting a need to bolster the overall health system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criteria. However, this category encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the capacity to manage complications during pregnancy, contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths attributed to hemorrhage. Consequently, while this indicator shows progress, it provides a somewhat incomplete picture, highlighting the need for further improvements. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of children under five years of age with diarrheal illnesses receiving treatment from a healthcare professional.  Data on postnatal care remains limited, but it is evident that this area requires significant attention, with low utilization rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below what might be anticipated, hovering around 4%. These rates also reveal another concerning disparity. While cesarean-section rates stand at 7% in urban areas, they are significantly lower at 2% in rural communities. This disparity underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, with a concentration of resources in urban centers.  Another pressing issue is vertical equity, as there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles.  This suggests that accessing healthcare services presents a significant challenge for the impoverished, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, improving neonatal and maternal healthcare indicators necessitates addressing the fundamental issue of inadequate service provision.  Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overarching health system without concentrating solely on pre- and postnatal care?  Clearly, program-based solutions to the aforementioned challenges are appealing. \"Vertical\" approaches, focusing on specific areas of improvement, often yield faster results and offer more manageable objectives. However, it is crucial to consider potential drawbacks.  \n\nConcentrating resources on a single health sector can lead to a decline in funding and human resources allocated to other vital areas.  This is exemplified by the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on the family planning sector.  Moreover, implementing multiple parallel programs within a single area can result in duplicated services and a lack of coordination, leading to increased administrative burden and complexity in supply chains and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the upper classes of the era. However, there are notable exceptions to this trend, with novels like \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" breaking away from convention. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, a departure from the typical Victorian novel, which serves to deepen the characters and illuminate their motivations and emotions.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and nature of these moments differ. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these experiences frequently offer glimpses into Oliver's inner world, revealing his pain and his understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the dire state of his health, as evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, replaced by a constant, gnawing fear. This raises the question of whose will is responsible for Oliver's misfortune, for it certainly wasn't his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little agency, unable to exert even a modicum of control over his fate, even when his life hangs in the balance. A sense of defeat also emerges, suggesting that Fagin has begun to break Oliver, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that Oliver would have made some effort, if only to save himself.\n\nAnother example of this dreamlike state is found in \"Wuthering Heights\": “The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I volunteered at an after-school program designed to assist elementary school students. While I tried to help all the children with their academic challenges, I excelled at tutoring in English and reading. One instructor asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade, as he was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. I quickly realized something wasn't quite right; his reading comprehension presented unusual obstacles. He would pronounce some letters flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him – it was truly perplexing. I knew he was of Latino heritage, and while he spoke English fluently, his reading skills lagged behind. We struggled to make progress until the day Adrian's mother arrived. \n\nI was supervising a small group of children while the rest of the program participants were on a field trip when she walked in.  His mother only spoke Spanish, and my grasp of the language was limited, as I had only begun learning it. Nevertheless, we managed to communicate using a combination of broken Spanish and hand gestures.  That's when a crucial realization struck me: Adrian wasn't incapable of reading; he simply lacked a strong understanding of the English alphabet. Whether this insight ultimately helped him, I can't say for sure, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the pervasive issue of language barriers in our schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates the importance of recognizing that challenges often aren't as apparent as they seem. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can present formidable hurdles. I believe we can all agree that this issue exists, so the question becomes: what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring him in English reading, focusing on alphabet recognition and pronunciation. However, for children who have limited English proficiency, the solution is far more complex. There is no single, magic bullet. \n\nDual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes – none of these approaches, in isolation, can fully address this problem. The key lies in a multi-faceted approach that combines all of these strategies. \n\n[A dual language system, for instance, is a commendable concept.  It benefits not only children whose first language is Spanish, but all students. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" according to research. Many fear that such programs are a wasteful use of resources and that the majority of students will not reap any benefits. This is a misconception.  If we implemented these programs more widely, rather than as an exception, all children would benefit.  \n\nHow do we achieve this? We don't need to require all teachers to be bilingual, which would be an unreasonable and impractical expectation. However, I believe there is no reason why we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to provide support.",
            "From childhood, many of us are told about a force beyond our understanding, something vast and unknowable.  Some seek answers in organized religion, attending Sunday school or temple, while others find solace in introspection.  Tradition often guides our beliefs, leading us to embrace the faith of our upbringing. Yet, some reject these doctrines entirely, clinging to the certainty of their own limited perspective. Our values shift and evolve, reflecting a journey of self-discovery as we navigate the complexities of spirituality. We all yearn for a guiding light, a beacon in the darkness that illuminates our path.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird.  We sat on the porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop to our conversation. The overflowing gutters cascaded water onto the wilting plants lining the edge of the porch.  He gazed out at the downpour, his eyes holding a mixture of contemplation and nostalgia.  He had become increasingly frail, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair, once thick and full, now seemed sparse and wispy. He avoided my gaze, lost in the relentless rain.  I felt a wave of loneliness wash over me, a fear so profound that I couldn't bring myself to voice my impending grief.  To speak of it would only make the reality more unbearable for both of us.  Instead, I embraced him, settled back into my chair, and moved closer, joining him in his silent contemplation of the fading light.\n\nMy father died in December, just five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his suffering, extending his life beyond the doctors' initial prognosis, but at what cost?  The purpose of his prolonged pain eluded me.  \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered into the empty night, my prayers unanswered.  I had chosen not to witness his final moments, unable to bear the sight of life slipping away from the man who had brought me into this world. I wanted to remember him as he had lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone else, better even than his own family.  I was certain he wouldn't want me to be a passive observer at his death.  For three days, I retreated into my bedroom, curling up in a ball, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The concept of the \"Gothic Novel\" presents an intriguing paradox, as aptly described by Ian Watt in his work \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" It oscillates between the familiar and the novel, a blend of \"Old\" and \"New.\" This genre has faced a spectrum of critical responses, from derision and accusations of superficiality to fervent praise for its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, masterfully merges elements of both ancient and modern romances, establishing a new mode of literary expression. Walpole ingeniously combines traditional theatrical elements with a contemporary emphasis on naturalistic descriptions, as he himself labels it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic literary tradition draws heavily on the aesthetics and conventions of medieval Gothic architecture, theater, and customs.  Even at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, the term \"Gothic\" had already been applied to a diverse range of cultures, styles, and eras. It often carried connotations of archaicism or cultural inferiority in comparison to the perceived advancements of the modern era. \n\nThis juxtaposition of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into the characters' inner lives, contributes to the enduring appeal of the Gothic genre. It simultaneously feels both antiquated and refreshingly new to readers separated by time from its origins.\n\nA prominent theme recurring in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry.  Medieval notions of chivalry, the rigorous training of a knight, are both preserved and reinterpreted in Walpole's seminal work, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors due to its embodiment of idealized qualities like bravery, honor, and competence. These authors, particularly Walpole, often lament the perceived decline of these ideals in contemporary society. Through the invocation of chivalric principles and conduct, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the genre's evolution towards Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a vehicle to critique the present and aspire towards a more virtuous future.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of political turmoil and personal accusations, grappled with anxieties about the future. He may have, consciously or unconsciously, drawn a connection between the perceived moral integrity and inherent \"goodness\" of past eras and the perceived failings of modern society. This sentiment is evident in several characters, notably Frederic.  Before we even meet him, Frederic's character is imbued with chivalric attributes:\n\n[Insert the passage describing Frederic here]\n\nThis description is replete with traditionally chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has endured suffering and tragedy, is marked by the tropes of a \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" albeit exaggerated, foreshadowing the Gothic tendency towards excess (66).",
            "The intricate dance of moving goods from initial concept to satisfied customer is known as supply chain management. Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this term encapsulates the delicate balancing act of planning, implementing, and controlling all stages – from raw materials to finished product delivery – to ensure customer needs are met with both speed and efficiency. \n\nAt its core, a successful supply chain rests on six fundamental pillars: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.  These elements, carefully orchestrated by skilled business managers, are the building blocks of superior customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial spark in this chain reaction, lays the groundwork for everything that follows. It dictates the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of creation, driven by a deep understanding of customer desires.  Market analysis becomes crucial here, acting as a compass guiding managers towards the products in highest demand.  Armed with this knowledge, they determine the precise quantities to be produced and the optimal location for manufacturing, factoring in both production volume and product quality to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce the production site is established, the focus shifts to meticulous scheduling and equipment maintenance. Every detail within production is a vital cog in the machine; neglecting any could result in costly delays and financial repercussions.  Consider, for example, the meticulous processes employed by retail giants like Walmart and Target. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, every aspect of their operations is meticulously documented, ensuring smooth workflow and clear expectations.\n\nThe second pillar, \"supply,\" encompasses the strategic choices made regarding a facility's core capabilities and its outsourcing partnerships.  A company might have multiple production divisions specializing in various aspects of a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise.  Here, the manager acts as a conductor, strategically assigning tasks to the most suitable division or, in some cases, outsourcing certain processes to external companies. This strategic outsourcing aims to enhance \"velocity\" - the ability to deliver quality products with flexibility while simultaneously minimizing costs.",
            "A street corner in a bustling city. A solitary figure stands, holding aloft a hand-made sign, its message stark and unsettling: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" This is Ellen Page, famed for her role in the film \"Juno,\" drawing attention to a distant and troubling reality. \n\nBurma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation currently under the control of a powerful military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup. In 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, marking the first public dissent in a decade. These demonstrations, led by Buddhist monks in their saffron robes, earned the name \"The Saffron Revolution.\"  Initially met with a degree of tolerance by the government, the situation quickly escalated into a violent confrontation. Monks were met with force, their peaceful gatherings disrupted, and monasteries were attacked. \n\nForeign journalists attempting to document the events were swiftly detained, with one, Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, tragically losing his life on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a protest. While official figures claim a comparatively low death toll of 13, a defected colonel from the Burmese army, Hla Win, asserted that the true number was far higher, citing thousands of casualties. \n\nSadly, this pattern of brutal suppression of dissent is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have sought to maintain absolute control over their populations, often resorting to violence and intimidation. From the Roman emperors who claimed divine authority to the Japanese emperors revered as deities, and even contemporary leaders who wield power with an iron fist, the desire for absolute control remains a persistent threat to freedom.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 stands as a chilling reminder of this dark reality. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered in the heart of Beijing to express their dissatisfaction with the government's authoritarian rule. The official death toll remains shrouded in secrecy, with conflicting reports suggesting a significantly higher number of casualties. \n\nAnother horrific example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically slaughtered Tutsis and moderate political figures.  And of course, the atrocities committed by Hitler's Nazi regime during the Holocaust, where millions of Jews were murdered, serve as a stark reminder of the depths of human cruelty.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the realm of jazz is largely attributed to both his prolonged career and his exceptional aptitude for molding his musical ensemble. While his pianistic contributions may not be overtly prominent in the compositions selected for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his ability to craft intricate and multifaceted musical pieces that allowed each band member to showcase their individual talents.  Ellington established a framework within which soloists could freely improvise, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically catered to the unique styles of his musicians, thereby highlighting specific musical concepts. This approach also served to define the overall tone of the orchestra, resulting in cohesive and original sonic textures tailored to each composition.  Through his mastery of individual instrumental voices and their integration within the evolving ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative spirit, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his lifelong practice of utilizing vocalization \"as a jazz instrument.\" This early work exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating voice to enrich texture and color without relying on lyrical content. \"Creole Love Call\" also exemplifies Ellington's skill in complementing the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his career. This languid, measured twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between vocals and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions to a more raspy sound towards its conclusion. \n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the fundamental melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo performed in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano passage.\n\nChorus 4: The full band replicates the first chorus, with a call-and-response pattern executed by the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections. \n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response exchange between vocals and reeds. In this iteration, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, functioning as an instrument during the solo.\n\nTag: A brief concluding section featuring a vocal flourish and a dissonant, novelistic ending provided by the trombone.\n\nEllington's artful utilization of voice to add another dimension of tonal color to this piece is but one example of a stylistic hallmark that permeates his entire body of work. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his talent for meticulous orchestration with his keen ear for tonal nuances. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing seamlessly merges the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental facets of Cox's voice, generating a rich and complementary sonic tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, as Ellington expertly employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart in Ellington's orchestra, to deliver the melody on muted trombone with exceptional effect.",
            "A persistent void had always resided within her, an unyielding longing that refused to be satiated. This yearning first emerged during her adolescence, around the age of fourteen, and three years later, at seventeen, it remained an undeniable presence.  Over time, she realized her desire wasn't for material possessions but for companionship, a connection she hadn't found with anyone, not even the boys who occasionally expressed interest. They made their clumsy attempts at courtship, but she remained unmoved. This peculiar phenomenon puzzled her, prompting constant introspection and attempts to decipher its cause. Years of pondering yielded several theories, but none that felt convincing enough to warrant serious consideration. So, she navigated life, perpetually wrestling with the enigma of her desires.\n\nHer daily life at home was typically tranquil. Her parents, both inherently calm and composed, rarely engaged in arguments, and disagreements with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their sole point of contention stemmed from her insistence on independence and expressive personality. Despite their serene nature, she countered their balanced energies with an exuberance and infectiously fun demeanor, making her a genuinely likable individual, a quality further enhanced by her inherent kindness.\n\nHowever, today's atmosphere was anything but serene. As she wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, a sharp cry pierced the air, her mother's melodious voice laced with distress. She rushed to the kitchen, panic rising within her as she cried, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?\"  She found her mother lying on the ground, writhing in apparent pain, uttering short, pained gasps. Her daughter immediately knelt beside her, reaching out to offer comfort. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the... hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words fragmented and strained.  Her daughter understood the gravity of the situation. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mother weakly gestured, and in that moment, the daughter was acutely grateful for the physical training she had undertaken. She carefully lifted her mother, placing her gently in the car's backseat, and drove them to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a symphony of disinfectant and sickness, tinged with an underlying fear. However, her daughter was too consumed with her mother's well-being to notice. She rushed her mother inside and immediately summoned medical assistance. A cluster of concerned faces gathered around as someone swiftly procured a gurney and laid her mother upon it. They whisked her away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to sit anxiously in the waiting area.\n\nHer mother's injury stemmed from a fall from a stepladder while attempting to reach a vase from the top shelf of their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the link between adherence to a dietary pattern known as the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths.  A specific measurement, the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" was used to gauge how closely individuals followed this dietary pattern. The aMed diet is a refined version of the Med diet, emphasizing plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting saturated fats and animal products. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a correlation between adhering to a Med diet and a reduced risk of both overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each participant six times based on their responses to food frequency questionnaires (\"FFQs\") designed to assess their dietary intake over the preceding year.  More than 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this duration. The accuracy of the FFQs was confirmed through validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by examining medical records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, diagnoses were considered \"probable\" and included in the study, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. \n\nFor each FFQ, factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed. To account for individual variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated the average aMed score across two consecutive years. \n\nTo minimize the influence of confounding factors (variables that could potentially distort the results), adjustments were made for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to analyze the association between the aMed score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke occurrences.\n\nThe findings revealed that a higher aMed diet score, indicating greater adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, was associated with a lower risk of developing both CHD and stroke in women.  Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a period of significant economic hardship in the United States.  Unemployment rates surged, the housing market experienced a dramatic downturn, and several prominent corporations faced severe financial distress. This economic downturn continues to have lingering effects, prompting an examination of its origins and potential solutions. At the heart of this crisis lies a complex interplay of factors, including risky lending practices and a vulnerable financial infrastructure. \n\nThe government's encouragement of sub-prime lending, coupled with the pressure on entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to package these mortgages into complex financial instruments, played a crucial role. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, a ripple effect was triggered, destabilizing the financial system and spreading the crisis throughout the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration.  The administration's pursuit of economic growth and increased homeownership led to the relaxation of lending standards. This, unfortunately, created an environment ripe for the sub-prime mortgage crisis that unfolded years later.  Journalists, such as Steven Holmes of The New York Times, at the time raised concerns about the potential consequences of these relaxed regulations, predicting a possible financial crisis reminiscent of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\n\nThe complex nature of mortgages in the years leading up to the crisis further exacerbated the situation.  Innovations like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) interconnected various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This interconnectedness resulted in excessive reliance on the housing market, leaving both households and financial institutions vulnerable to price fluctuations.\n\nThe bursting of the housing bubble exposed the fragility of this system. Financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. Major investment banks, including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, faced substantial distress, leading to mergers, bankruptcies, and increased government intervention.",
            "Exposition:  The Dreaded Battlefield of Storytelling\n\nExposition, that crucial juncture in a narrative, can be a double-edged sword.  On one hand, it's a chance to paint a vivid picture with your words, to captivate your readers with your mastery of language and your ability to transport them to another world. On the other hand, it can be the very thing that sends your audience reaching for the \"Back\" button, their eyes glazed over from an overload of information.  \n\nThe seasoned writer, Dr. Merlin, can attest to this struggle firsthand.  She's known to let out a frustrated cry when she encounters a deluge of exposition that drowns out the narrative flow.  The key, as any aspiring writer knows, is to \"show, don't tell.\"  Yet, even the most experienced authors can fall into the trap of long, meandering passages that lack action or tension.\n\nExposition, in essence, involves directly informing the reader about events, often in a straightforward manner.  Think of it as a character in a film delivering a lengthy monologue, spewing out a torrent of backstory or crucial details, reminiscent of the \"Ancient Mariner\" reciting his tale.  In fiction, it's the author taking on the role of the omniscient narrator, delivering information rather than allowing the story to unfold organically.\n\nLet's consider an example.  Imagine a story where a heroine's beloved is murdered.  Would you want the author to spend two pages simply stating facts about their relationship:  where and when they met, the extravagant wedding, the tragic demise?  Certainly not!\n\nInstead, you'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions.  You'd want to see how his presence enriched the heroine's life, how it shaped her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams. A well-crafted introduction to the husband would allow you to connect with him emotionally, to feel the depth of his love and the weight of his loss.\n\nThe point is, exposition should be used sparingly and strategically.  Don't simply state the facts; bring them to life.  Instead of summarizing a character's history, weave it into the narrative, revealing their complexities through their interactions, their choices, and their inner thoughts.\n\nRemember, as a writer, your goal is to engage your readers, to draw them into your world and make them care about what happens.  Don't let exposition become a barrier between you and your audience.",
            "I watched two local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011.  The first was a live report from NBC 4. The lead story involved a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed.  The segment, lasting about two minutes, provided limited details, stating that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and Hostettler apprehended. The coverage seemed appropriately concise given the developing nature of the story. \n\nThe next story focused on the shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers was critically injured and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. This story felt somewhat abbreviated, and I wondered if this was due to the race of the victim and the neighborhood where the incident occurred.  A pattern I've observed is that media coverage of crimes involving minorities often receives less attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims.\n\nThe third story addressed a gunshot hole found in a MedFlight helicopter. Details about the suspected location and the determination that a .22 caliber rifle bullet caused the damage were provided. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nNext, the news briefly touched upon the anticipated rain and thunderstorms for the weekend, mentioning expected temperatures in the mid to low eighties. The segment felt intentionally short, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nA story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was also covered. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around one hundred and fifty pounds.  The emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone seemed disproportionately long, which struck me as unusual.\n\nFinally, the news reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug trafficker. He had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio.  The use of \"300 months\" instead of the more common \"25 years\" felt odd, perhaps an attempt to emphasize the severity of the sentence. The mention of Rodriguez's Hispanic background seemed tangential to the story.",
            "The relationship between brothers is complex, characterized by a powerful and often unyielding connection.  This bond encompasses a spectrum of emotions, ranging from affection and admiration to envy and even cruelty. Brothers possess a unique understanding of each other, a level of insight that transcends typical relationships. They see their own reflection in their brother's eyes, not the image others perceive, but a truer, more authentic self.  It is in times of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether for good or ill. The intensity of these emotions inevitably carries a weighty consequence.  Comprehending the emotions that stem from this fraternal tie involves confronting the repercussions they bring. \n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" delves into this theme, exploring the turbulent emotions inherent in a brotherly bond. Set against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered scenery, two young brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile. The story culminates in a scene where profound disappointment collides with intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive. The narrative weaves together the protagonist's direct experiences and interactions with his brother, providing a glimpse into the protagonist's complex emotional landscape and his perception of the world around him. These factors profoundly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by a powerful emotion: pride.  From their initial outings together to their final, fateful adventure, a sense of resentment festers within the protagonist towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearns for a companion who can share in his outdoor pursuits, someone who can keep pace with him in physical challenges and adventures. This desire is unmet, as Doodle's physical limitations, stemming from a weak heart, make such activities impossible.  The protagonist's dreams of a brother who could join him in his explorations are shattered. This disappointment manifests as anger, even leading to a fleeting thought of harming Doodle. However, Doodle's innocent smile evokes a surge of affection in the protagonist, suggesting that his darker thoughts were ultimately fleeting. Deep down, a fundamental love for his brother persists.",
            "The human brain is a complex system responsible for processing and generating creative outputs. As technology evolved, so too did the analogies used to describe its function. Initially, comparisons were drawn to rudimentary tools like wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, later evolving to encompass the book and, in modern times, the computer. However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful for conceptualization, possess inherent limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where our organs translate physical stimuli – touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo a series of transformations within the brain, guided by intricate algorithms operating in both bottom-up and top-down fashions. Consider, for example, the image of a black box against a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes fundamental elements like color, orientation, and boundary delineations to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, leveraging prior knowledge and context, refines this recognition, distinguishing it as a solid box rather than a mere void.\n\nOnce processed to a certain level, an attentional gatekeeper determines the significance of the incoming signal and directs it towards appropriate cognitive processes.  While your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance downward, a healthy attentional filter prevents conscious awareness of each individual blade. Conversely, your name, spoken amidst a cacophony, is readily singled out. This selective filtering occurs across multiple processing stages, constantly modulating the flow of information.\n\nFor effective processing, information must first be stored. The brain employs various memory systems, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Encoding initiates this process, with different strategies employed for diverse sensory inputs. Verbal information, for instance, can be encoded structurally (based on visual appearance), phonemically (based on sound), or semantically (based on meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, holding information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical loop within a specific neuronal circuit. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be anchored in the structural organization of certain protein types.\n\nNumerous models attempt to decipher the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing inspiration from human memory retrieval patterns, computer science principles, and neurophysiological observations. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as interconnected nodes, with links signifying their relationships. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which, in turn, might be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel, *Brave New World*, a chilling critique emerges regarding the impending dangers of technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it.  The novel paints a picture of a society where communal harmony takes precedence over individual identity. From their earliest moments, citizens are meticulously conditioned to prioritize instant gratification above all else, becoming unwitting players in a larger societal game orchestrated by the omnipresent World Controller.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, particularly the concepts of homogenization and reification, Huxley’s anxieties surrounding the trajectory of these emerging systems become increasingly apparent. The novel's exploration of false consciousness, a key tenet of Marxist thought, is particularly striking. The general populace, preoccupied with personal gain, remains oblivious to the true power dynamics inherent in the economic structure. This ideological manipulation, akin to the control exerted over the proletariat in Marxist theory, is vividly depicted in the conditioning of *Brave New World’s* citizens.  The lower social castes, designated Delta, Gamma, and so on, lack independent agency; their desires are  shaped and amplified through hypnopædia, a technique that instills a fervent appetite for consumption and indulgence, ultimately serving the interests of the World Controller.  \n\nThe concept of hegemony, wherein a dominant group exerts control over subordinate groups, is also evident in this societal construct.  The lower classes remain unaware of the manipulative forces at play, effectively \"embracing an ideology that upholds this system\" - namely, capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, born with the capacity for awareness, choose to remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions.  Even characters like Bernard, an Alpha, barely challenge the status quo. The interactions between these social strata further underscore the perceived oppression inherent in this capitalist system.\n\nRelationships in *Brave New World* are strikingly superficial, lacking the depth and complexity often found in human connections.  Huxley seems to suggest that the confluence of technological advancement and capitalism simultaneously erodes individual freedom and self-expression.  Love and intense emotions are absent; interactions are reduced to mere transactions, often characterized by superficial observations of physical attributes.  The unquestioning acceptance of their assigned positions within the social hierarchy by each class further exemplifies the socioeconomic impact of capitalism.  Their unwavering obedience reflects a Marxist perspective on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal norms.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus, a common challenge for many students, including myself, has often presented a hurdle. During my first year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center.  Commuting from my home in Stuart Hall to classes held in distant locations, such as the Willard Building near the campus core, could easily consume up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when adverse weather conditions prevailed, which is frequent in our State College climate. Through conversations with a recent alumnus, not much older than myself, I learned that the East Halls dormitories were once isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of unused land. This expanse has since been transformed into a tapestry of athletic fields, imposing new structures including the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of apartment complexes. As our campus continues its expansion, traversing from one point to another becomes increasingly arduous. What, then, is the most effective solution to this mobility predicament? On a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a viable answer. However, the bicycle alone is insufficient. Students must embrace cycling, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who recently rekindled his passion for cycling after a several-year hiatus prompted him to ponder why he ever abandoned it.  “Bicycles are exceptional,” he remarked, “while for a period, cycling wasn't perceived as fashionable, it's undeniably the most practical means of transportation.”  Beyond its physical benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of travel.  A simple breakfast of oatmeal, accompanied by a moderate amount of exertion, can propel you over 30 miles.  Like many undergraduates, I now reside off-campus, located a comparable distance from the campus center as some dormitories.  The most astute decision I've made this year has been to acquire a bicycle.  Daily, I attend classes in Thomas Building, a location that typically requires a 25-minute walk from my residence. Cycling, however, can significantly reduce this duration to a mere 5 minutes, provided I maintain a brisk pace.  However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas Building from my home, is not always a smooth ride, whether on foot or bicycle.  Walking possesses its own merits, but personally, my schedule is too demanding to allow for extended walking periods.  Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole reliable option for reaching my classes.  Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30 to 40 minutes to my day, equating to over two and a half hours each week.  Adding to this the time required for walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, it becomes an unmanageable burden."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

I envision myself working within the Division of Family and Children Services, providing vital support to both vulnerable children and their families navigating challenging times.  The core values that I bring to this field – service, respect, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships – are not merely professional ideals; they are deeply ingrained principles that guide my personal life as well.\n\nMy journey towards social work began with a lifelong yearning to make a positive impact on the world.  During my high school and college years, I observed how some individuals struggled to cope with their problems, resorting to unhealthy or unproductive methods. Witnessing these struggles solidified my desire to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. While my initial goal was to understand human behavior, I wasn't certain about a specific career path. A pivotal experience occurred during a summer break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009.  A friend introduced me to a troubled teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. This encounter sparked a profound realization within me.  Driven by a desire to help, I reached out to the boy's parents, offering my support and sharing my educational background. Although the situation highlighted the limitations of legal intervention, it ignited a passion within me to pursue a career where I could directly advocate for children in need.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply with me.  As a society, we often celebrate individuality while simultaneously promoting conformity. This apparent contradiction raises questions about our true commitment to embracing uniqueness. I believe in challenging social norms and advocating for equality for all. Throughout my academic years, I actively participated in protests and demonstrations against injustice, expressing my individuality through my appearance, associations, and unwavering support for marginalized communities.  \n\nMy passion for social justice fuels my commitment to making a tangible difference in the world.

Conversely, sociocultural models investigate the influence of environmental factors like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status on sleep patterns. This analysis delves into these models, examining selected research to illuminate their intricacies and provide a comprehensive understanding.  Each study's findings are critically assessed, highlighting both strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders arising from external factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias, characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS).  Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve abnormal behaviors or physiological events during sleep, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders associated with mental health conditions are often linked to either Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, with some exploration of broader primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, inherited traits, and physiological factors in sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in controlling sleep-wake cycles. A study utilizing mice models revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and sleep induction.  The administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that the mouse model can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Dysfunction or absence of this receptor could potentially disrupt sleep patterns, requiring medication for adequate rest.  From a sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep regulation, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep, potentially impacting various aspects of life, including academic performance, career success, and daily activities requiring focus and sustained attention.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  Firstly, it provides a concise definition of the disorder.  Next, the diagnostic process is outlined, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the document concludes by offering strategies that teachers in inclusive classroom settings can implement to support students with CAPD. \n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005) defines CAPD as the perceptual processing of sound within the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that drives this processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. Essentially, it's a condition where the brain struggles to properly process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\"  The challenge lies in the brain's ability to translate sound, differentiating words and separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest mention of this disorder, then known as \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were studying children with communication disorders. An Italian research team, composed of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing tests for these children in 1954. Building upon this work, Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961, formulating a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways.  Individuals with CAPD may have difficulty localizing sounds, distinguishing between auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm based on tone. They might experience auditory blocking, where one sound obscures the preceding one, and may struggle to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information. Additionally, they may have difficulty determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests.  Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other qualified professionals utilize a variety of measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This assessment may encompass questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli.  Currently, there is no single, universally accepted test for diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers.  More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complexities of disguise, suggesting that while it can be effective for extended periods of deception, it ultimately carries a risk of losing one's true identity. Ending such a charade presents a significant challenge, as it may lead to social alienation.  Ultimately, individuals face a difficult choice: preserving their authentic selves or maintaining relationships with others who may be negatively impacted by the revelation.  \n\nWhile some might react neutrally to uncovering a deception, others could experience offense or resentment. The play delves particularly into the complications of gender role reversal as a form of disguise, raising questions about the motivations behind such a choice. In Viola's case, her assumption of a male identity, \"Cesario,\" is driven by a need for self-preservation in a foreign land. As she states, she seeks refuge with a \"captain\" who aided her in a past situation (\"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249)). \n\nHowever, this strategy isolates her from female companionship, severing a crucial support network.  Furthermore, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads to Olivia's infatuation, creating a complex web of mistaken identities. Olivia's declaration, \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,\" (5.1.138) highlights the confusion and unintended consequences of Viola's disguise.  Additionally, Viola grapples with her own suppressed feelings for Orsino, who expresses his admiration for her: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261).\n\nWhile this might appear progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a reflection on how deception can expose hidden emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters harbor unexpressed desires, brought to the surface by the presence of Viola/Cesario. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario rooted in his perceived masculinity, or does it reveal a deeper, unexamined inclination towards women?  One could argue that Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, coupled with her eventual acceptance of Cesario/Viola as family (\"A sister, you are she,\" (5.1.315)), suggests she is more likely satirizing the superficial judgments prevalent in her era.",
            "German colonial rule is remembered for its harsh realities, particularly the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa.  However, such a vast empire cannot be reduced to a single narrative. The German colonial experience was as multifaceted as its geographical expanse, encompassing a range of policies and governing styles. Educational initiatives across the colonies mirrored this diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant population of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German educational efforts.  Contemporary accounts also lauded German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies. \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government established public schools and actively participated in the education of the indigenous population, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely entrusted to missionary societies, albeit with limited government support. The German government, however, did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support and oversight for missionary institutions. These contrasting educational policies had enduring consequences for South West Africa, extending even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by formal education, with the vast majority of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate. A confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly by examining new research on the perspectives and attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous African population.\n\nA substantial body of literature explores education within the German colonial empire.  Most of these sources are in German and originate from the early twentieth century, spanning the period of and immediately following German colonial rule.  Early works primarily focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across the various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems implemented in different colonies.  The most prominent work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and investigates the factors contributing to the observed differences.  Cohen posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, though much of the territory is characterized by arid desert.  The European population of South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the last century has resulted in a vast and constantly expanding array of genres. Pinpointing an exhaustive list proves challenging, as most, if not all, established genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous subgenres and sub-subgenres. Among these, the subgenre of heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive forms of popular music in the past four decades.  \n\nIts expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, often leaning towards the more somber and intense ends. The genre's diversity is evident in its early iterations, where musicians quickly recognized its inherent flexibility and began to experiment, creating unique subgenres that in turn gave rise to even more specialized offshoots, a trend that continues to this day.\n\n\nThe heavy metal movement has reached a point where the sheer number of niche groups makes it difficult to define precisely what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from various other genres, yet its origins remain significant. To truly appreciate the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the nature of the heavy metal movement itself, understanding why it transcends the confines of a simple genre categorization.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement characterized by a distinct darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatrical elements.  It moves away from primitivism, emphasizing technical proficiency; metal musicians are renowned for their mastery of their instruments, a quality that shines through in their music.  Metal is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement deeply intertwined with drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s fueled a sense of experimentation and pushed musicians to create unconventional and otherworldly sounds, often attributing their creations to the influence of these substances.  It possesses visceral and often dark qualities that were relatively novel to the music scene at the time, as much popular music lacked such a connection to the darker emotional spectrum.  Later generations of metal artists have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements that were prominent in the Romantic era. Lyrics such as those found in \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify this inherent darkness:\n\n  \n\nThese lyrics, showcasing a darker side of The Beatles, evoke a sense of emotional turmoil and instability, possibly reflecting the influence of drug use. Considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of heavy metal, it was a direct response to a heavier, more intense Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their own capacity for power and intensity, including this track on their iconic \"White Album.\"",
            "Long before the Surrealists painted their dreamlike canvases, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist artist, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" depicts not just a woman awestruck by the wonders of her dreamland, but also reflects Rousseau's personal aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. Yet, he grappled with a significant internal conflict in pursuing this ambition.  \"The Dream\" stands as the embodiment of Rousseau's lifelong struggle: to either conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance within the art world he deeply admired, or to forge his own unique path, embracing creative independence.\n\nTo truly understand \"The Dream\" through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, a town in northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau's father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer (Shattuck 47). Despite his upbringing, Rousseau received no formal artistic training. Instead, he worked for the French municipal toll service, earning him the nickname \"gabelou,\" until the age of forty (Shattuck 46).  Tragedy struck when his first wife, Clémence, passed away, followed by the loss of eight infant children, leaving him with only his daughter, Julia, and profound grief (Shattuck 49).  Seeking solace and a new beginning, Rousseau turned to painting as a source of comfort and inspiration. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau, a true folk painter, captured the hopes and dreams of the everyday person.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance within the art world is understandable when viewed in this context.  Not only was he self-taught and began his artistic journey later in life, but he also emerged during a time when many talented and established modern artists were gaining recognition. While he had been painting for years, Rousseau's work only began to receive widespread acclaim around the same time as Matisse's rise to prominence. According to Jan Gordon in \"Modern French Painters,\" although they were artistic rivals,  Matisse and Rousseau differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting.  Gordon writes, \"Matisse feared painting in a trite manner, while Rousseau aspired to paint in such a conventional style that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Throughout history, many brilliant minds have observed a profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting an underlying bond between truth and beauty.  I concur with this notion, believing there's a fundamental reason for this pairing.  John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" eloquently captures this sentiment: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often acquire knowledge through formal education or personal experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional methods.  Both fields, as Keats implies, resemble attempts at description rather than prescription. Our explorations into morality and beauty primarily aim to decipher the reasons behind a work's artistic merit or an action's ethical implications, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nFurthermore, any critique of art or morality ultimately falls short of fully grasping the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty.  Consider the Mona Lisa, a masterpiece by da Vinci.  Discussions about its value might revolve around elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, yet these factors fail to fully elucidate its artistic excellence. When asked about a cherished work of art or literature, individuals often express a sense of ineffable quality,  preceded by phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" before elaborating further. I propose that both art and morality resist complete reduction to a mere description of their attributes. Flannery O'Connor aptly states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how comprehensively we analyze the characteristics of a literary work, an intangible element remains, defying complete articulation.  I believe ethics shares this inherent quality.  As Wittgenstein observes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"  It is this elusive \"something,\" this indefinable essence, which I posit as the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This transcendental nature of both fields, I argue, forms a bridge connecting them.\n\nThe profound connection between morality and art stems from the fact that we experience both most powerfully on a  noumenal level,  a concept borrowed from Kant.  They resonate with us on a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This link intensifies when considering the art form of literature.  As McKean eloquently states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its cultural tapestry woven from the alpine heights of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel.  A singular spirit pervades from the banks of the Rhine in Köln, stretching through the heart of the country to the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Given this unique cultural blend, it's no surprise that the Germany we know today has roots in a multitude of diverse sources and ancestral tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germanic peoples, holds a name shrouded in historical debate. Scholars and historians alike grapple with its origins. Tacitus, in his historical writings, attributed the name to the Tungrian tribe, suggesting they were previously known as \"Germans\" before crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often under questionable motivations (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  He borrowed this word from the Gauls themselves, utilizing it as a marker of distinction. While the precise meaning remains elusive, some propose it originated from a Gaulish term for a neighboring people.  In the opening chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles” (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories posit that the name derives from the \"ger,\" the spear used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" suggesting a boisterous or vocal people (Names of Germany).\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" explored the origins of the Germans, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nThe Romans, for their part, held limited interest in Germania. While they ventured into Germanic territories for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely confined their presence to the periphery of this wild and untamed land. The Germanic tribes, meanwhile, flourished along the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods acquired from their lands and contributing their skills as soldiers within the Roman legions (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I lowered my gaze, my mind attempting to process the scene before me. It was a detached observation, devoid of strong emotion. I analyzed the picture with a practiced eye, yet it remained an abstract image, failing to spark any deep understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, appearing and disappearing in rapid succession. My mind worked with such fluidity and precision that it felt as if I was merely experiencing the visuals, rather than forming my own thoughts about them.\n\nOnce, an artist I collaborated with suggested I read a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I'd always wanted to learn to draw, ever since I was a child, and this book promised to teach everything from the fundamentals of using a pencil to the intricate ways the brain interprets lines. One technique it emphasized was using a square frame to isolate a specific area within a complex image. Instead of being overwhelmed by intricate details, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, the artist could focus on the simpler essence—just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface.  \n\nAs I stood before the bowl, however, I couldn't mentally construct that frame. I was completely captivated, lost in awe. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters embraced a vibrant palette. If I harbored any artistic aspirations, this scene felt like the beginning of my journey, the start of my own story—a work I envisioned as \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers brushed against my chosen instrument of creation, my muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, transforming my mental intention into physical form. It felt like a potentially pivotal moment in my creative life. The water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Fragments of matter detached themselves, carried away into nothingness. My muscles tensed again, twitching and spasming with a growing sense of urgency. My hand slammed down on the toilet handle once more. The offending brown package stubbornly refused to budge, clinging to the bottom of the bowl like a tenacious slug.\n\nHolding a mop loosely in my hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, a green tie feeling uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned slightly as I stared at the unpleasant collection of processed animal and plant matter that someone had left as a message for the unlucky bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand reached for the wall beside me. Grasping the end of the toilet paper, I began wrapping it around my hand, transforming it into something resembling an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a parent reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey…",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among teenagers highlights a critical issue demanding immediate attention.  Various factors converge to create this dangerous trend, with the National Institutes of Health identifying the immaturity of the adolescent brain as a significant contributing factor.   \n\nIn addition to developmental factors, inexperience plays a crucial role.  Studies, such as one conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, demonstrate a direct correlation between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents, underscoring the heightened risk associated with teenage driving, particularly when accompanied by peers. \n\nEfforts to mitigate this issue, such as provisional licenses with restricted driving hours and passenger limitations, represent temporary solutions.  The underlying problem lies in the inherent challenges faced by young drivers in adequately managing the complexities and responsibilities inherent in operating a motor vehicle. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, through his research cited in USA Today, suggests that even the age of 18 may be too young for full driving privileges, citing a prevalent inclination among individuals under 20 to engage in risky behavior for the sake of thrill-seeking.\n\nDelaying driving until this propensity for risk-taking diminishes could prove beneficial.  Failing to address this issue will likely result in a catastrophic surge in fatalities as the next generation of drivers, the \"echo boomers,\" reach driving age within the coming years.\n\nA straightforward legislative approach could involve continuing driver's education programs while prohibiting individuals under 18 from operating motor vehicles.  A provisional permit system could remain in place, coupled with a mandated number of supervised driving hours, mirroring the requirements of many states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. Because the alarming statistics affecting teen drivers are prevalent across the nation, uniform national legislation would be a logical and potentially effective measure to safeguard young people nationwide. \n\nThe proposed legislation is not unprecedented.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s historical film collection, I became fascinated by a group of early Edison films classified as “trick films.”  This collection, encompassing fifteen films from 1895 to 1901, primarily relied on innovative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis focused on identifying the common stylistic elements found in the majority of these films, while also examining the unique characteristics that emerged in a few later examples.\n\nA defining feature of the trick film at the turn of the century is its restricted setting. These films were typically confined within a frontal proscenium, meaning the camera maintained a fixed position and did not move to follow characters or objects. This composition, drawing inspiration from both theatre and vaudeville, often resulted in limited movement within the frame, with figures primarily moving side-to-side rather than towards or away from the camera.  A prime example is the film “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel” (1900), where actors enter from one side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis, remaining within the confines of the proscenium even as they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictated the camera’s framing, favoring long and occasionally medium shots. Close-up shots were entirely absent in these early trick films. This mirrored the theatrical tradition, where the audience would observe the entire performance within the established boundaries of the stage.  \n\nFurther reinforcing this theatrical influence, most early trick films adhered to a strict “one shot equals one film” approach. This convention limited the length of most films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricted the narrative possibilities, as most trick films focused on short, vaudeville-inspired tricks such as magic, disappearances, and substitutions, rather than developing complex storylines. However, it is important to note that the concept of a “shot” in these films might not always align with a single physical take. A single “shot” could potentially be composed of several individual takes spliced together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For instance, a closer examination of “The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots” (1895), an early trick film, reveals the moment where the physical shot of Mary’s severed “head” begins, despite the film being presented as a single, continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the principles of Republicanism, emerging as a prominent figure in its early days. Though his background was primarily agricultural, his experience in this field and his brief foray into politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering commitment to individual liberty and limited government. His dedication to agrarian ideals served as the foundation for his political beliefs, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution's interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor envisioned the United States as possessing a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of governance. He believed the absence of deeply rooted traditions allowed for the creation of a government truly reflective of the people's will. A strong believer in the inherent rights of individuals, he asserted that these rights were interconnected and mutually dependent. He argued that if one right were infringed upon, all would be weakened, diminishing their overall value. These fundamental rights, in his view, should exist beyond the reach of governmental control.  He contended that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and cunning, leading to an imbalance of power.  He believed that in a civilized society, this dynamic must be rectified.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor proposed a government structure that acknowledged both the inherent goodness and potential for evil within human nature. He held firm to a dualistic view of morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167).  He defined good principles as those safeguarding private property, promoting agricultural progress, and discouraging the excesses of capitalism. He believed that a government grounded in these principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would inevitably be influenced by self-interest.  He viewed self-interest as a fundamental human motivator, but deemed it detrimental when it superseded the common good and led to the creation of self-serving sub-societies that exploited others. A well-designed government, in his opinion, was essential to contain these inherent human flaws and prevent the erosion of ethical principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, believing in a limited federal government with powers explicitly defined within its text. He recognized that an expansive federal government could become tyrannical and fiscally burdensome. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, arguing that without considering the intentions of the Founding Fathers, such an approach could lead to unforeseen and potentially harmful consequences. Furthermore, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, emphasizing its portrayal of the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single, unified entity.",
            "The data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a significant decrease in commuter log submissions during the project's third month, a trend that raised concerns.  Several factors could have contributed to this decline. The transition to winter in a New England setting likely impacted commuting patterns, particularly those relying on bicycles or walking. December, coinciding with the end of the fall semester, saw students and faculty consumed with academic demands and holiday preparations, potentially leading to a decline in log completion.  Additionally, the month-long winter break further minimized the need for campus presence, potentially causing log submissions to fall off.  The low number of logs in January, despite the resumption of classes, remains unexplained.\n\nIt is possible that the initial enthusiasm surrounding the project naturally waned over time, a common challenge for such initiatives.  To counteract this, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign was implemented in March, aiming to re-energize participation and successfully resulting in an increase in log submissions. This highlighted the importance of maintaining project momentum, navigating both general engagement fluctuations and the unique challenges posed by academic calendars and extended breaks.\n\nA fundamental obstacle for any alternative commuting program is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for automobile independence.  To encourage participation, a variety of incentives, including gift certificates to local businesses and national chains, were offered.  Exploring the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or electric cars, could have further motivated engagement and potentially mitigated the project's observed dip in participation. While the existing prizes proved sufficient initially, increasing their value throughout the project, perhaps by adding bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, might have yielded greater results.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to index funds. However, ETFs offer greater flexibility, trading like individual stocks on stock exchanges.  \n\nETFs provide the diversification advantages of index funds while also allowing investors the benefits typically associated with individual stocks, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractions of a share.  \n\nWhile these advantages are highly appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.  However, it's important to note that trading ETFs incurs a commission, similar to buying or selling individual stocks.\n\nFurthermore, the ETF market boasts a wide array of options, catering to diverse investment strategies.  Even with these clear benefits, it's prudent for discerning investors to critically assess whether the advertised advantages, like diversification, are truly realized and to what extent.\n\nThis analysis will focus on ETF IHF, comparing its performance to the top ten holdings that constitute a significant portion of its assets.  The goal is to determine if owning a single ETF like IHF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks.  Additionally, we will explore whether alternative stock combinations within this group could potentially yield a more optimal return for a given level of risk (as measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nExamining every holding within the ETF would be cumbersome, so we will concentrate on the top ten holdings, which collectively represent approximately 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. \n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent ETF IHF as a whole, we will leverage their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return.  This assumes the portfolio were composed entirely of these ten stocks in the same proportions as held by the ETF.  The calculated beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings generated a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF itself.  \n\nBased on these preliminary findings, a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings appears to offer both higher returns and lower risk (as indicated by the lower beta) compared to the ETF.  However, it's essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.  \n\nTo address this, we will determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his superior poetic works. Within the poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" on two occasions, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by scholar Mabbott. Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost edge of their known world. While Virgil's usage is well-documented, another influential source should be acknowledged. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nThe inclusion of \"Thulé\" highlights Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's poem and Goethe's verse, suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from the German master.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe's death in 1832.  Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a poignant short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This piece revolves around a king who, after his wife's death, descends into heavy drinking and mourning.  Overwhelmed by grief, he ultimately decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children except for a goblet, a memento of his deceased queen. He walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and takes his final breath. The character of the King of Thulé shares striking similarities with the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own experiences with loss and reliance on alcohol. \n\n Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just prior to Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works. While he employs the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he utilizes \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" acting as bookends for the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as companion pieces, with Poe's poem seeming to step directly into the emotional landscape of Goethe's work. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a desolate Thulé, plagued by darkness, loneliness, and the haunting presence of deceased friends, a world devoid of color. These elements resonate with the emotional turmoil of the King of Thulé, who, having lost his wife, grapples with profound loneliness and a loss of purpose.\n\nGoethe's literary significance would have ensured Poe's familiarity with his work, particularly given Poe's admiration for Tennyson, who was influenced by Goethe. Moreover, numerous reproductions of Goethe's works circulated after their initial publication, further exposing Poe to his writings.",
            "The question of whether a customer injured in a California grocery store from an applesauce spill could receive punitive damages hinges on the actions of the store manager.  \n\nLegally, a plaintiff seeking punitive damages must demonstrate the defendant's conduct was not merely negligent, but rather exhibited a deliberate indifference to the potential harm their actions could cause. This means proving the defendant acted with malice, which in this context, could be characterized as intentional misconduct or, in the absence of intent, a reckless disregard for the safety of others. \n\nIn this case, Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages might be successful. She could argue that the manager, Paul Martin, knew of the potential danger posed by the uncleaned spill, given prior incidents of similar accidents at the store. His alleged disregard for these past incidents and his prioritization of his dinner break over customer safety could be presented as evidence of a willful and conscious disregard for the well-being of shoppers. \n\nThe strength of Palmer's claim rests on establishing the manager's actions as not just negligent, but demonstrably malicious. While the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 is compelling, proving the manager's state of mind and  conscious disregard for the risks will be crucial to securing punitive damages. \n\nThe timeline of events is significant. On October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin, however, dismissed their concerns, stating he was on a dinner break and unable to address customer issues.  Tragically, an hour later, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. This incident occurred amidst a pattern of previous slip-and-fall incidents, further strengthening Palmer's argument that Martin was aware of the potential dangers and chose to ignore them.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages are awarded in cases where a defendant's conduct meets a high threshold of culpability.  It is for the court to determine if Martin's actions rise to this level of malice, taking into account all the evidence presented.",
            "My exploration of Islam began nearly four years ago during a course at CBC. One of the most compelling discussions we had centered around the perception of Islam – a question that feels even more crucial in today's world. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a significant shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents in America, transitioning from a state of hostility to an almost overwhelming embrace.  It's hard to imagine, just over two decades ago, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his family's undeniable Muslim heritage, even being conceivable.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography captivated my attention. My prior understanding of his history painted a picture of a figure who forcefully converted individuals and subjugated tribes through military conquest. However, the biography presented a different narrative, portraying Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr, a figure who humbly engaged with others and invited them to embrace his teachings. This contrast intrigued me, as it challenged my preconceived notions.\n\nFurther comparisons between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's documented \"miracles\" also sparked my curiosity.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a multitude of people. This narrative style, emphasizing Muhammad's humility and reliance on divine guidance, led me to question whether it aimed to present him as a more relatable figure, somewhat akin to Jesus.\n\nWhile I found this approach intriguing, it also raised concerns for me. The emphasis on Muhammad's supposed miracles, while well-intentioned, seemed to diminish the unique and unparalleled significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles. It felt as if certain aspects of Jesus's story were being subtly appropriated.\n\nThe biography also presented numerous accounts of individuals converting to Islam independently, supposedly providing evidence of its truth. However, many of these accounts relied on hearsay, recounted through multiple intermediaries. This reliance on second-hand information, while intended to lend credibility, ultimately diminished the stories' impact and introduced a sense of uncertainty.\n\nPerhaps my most significant discomfort stemmed from the biography's attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – humble, wise, gentle, and endearing. This portrayal clashed with my understanding of historical accounts, which depicted a more complex figure. It left me wondering if modern Muslims are fully aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought after the life of Jesus presents a fascinating study. While the beliefs and teachings attributed to him formed the foundation,  the path Christianity took diverged significantly from its origins.  Contemporary society, marked by a heightened awareness of progress and change, is witnessing a shift in religious landscapes.  Traditional viewpoints, though persisting within certain segments of the population, might not hold sway over the broader trend. \n\nLooking towards the future, a growing awareness of Christianity's historical development is anticipated. This will likely fuel a desire to distinguish the doctrines that emerged over time from the core principles espoused by Jesus.  This process, though potentially spanning decades or even centuries, suggests an inevitable trajectory: a return to the essence of Jesus' message.\n\nImagine a movement gaining momentum, gradually peeling away layers of accumulated doctrines, much like a clock rewinding.  This could lead to a return to a purer form of Christianity, focused solely on the teachings attributed to Jesus himself.  As this trend takes hold in regions like the United States and Europe, it could reshape religious practices and beliefs,  bringing a renewed emphasis on the simplicity of Jesus' original message.\n\nThis shift, however, might not result in a decentralized or fragmented religious landscape.  Rather, the theological pendulum could swing towards greater uniformity.  Denominational and regional differences might gradually diminish, culminating in a more unified expression of Christian faith.  History offers numerous examples of such reversals, from the Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to adopter of Christianity to the evolution of societal attitudes towards race and equality.\n\nThe success of this envisioned reversion hinges on a reinterpretation of Jesus' words, viewing them through a metaphorical lens rather than adhering to a strictly literal interpretation.  What, then, transpired between Jesus' lifetime and the present day?\n\nTracing the origins of Christianity, we encounter Judaism, from which it emerged.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established itself as a monotheistic religion, with a divinely inspired scripture and a strong sense of religious authority.  While united in their core beliefs, the Jewish population was not monolithic, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people coexisting within its midst.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" presents a stark and unsettling portrait of human nature, suggesting that at its core, humanity is driven by greed and self-interest. This inherent flaw is starkly illustrated through the actions of the factory owners and managers who prioritize their own success above all else. Their relentless pursuit of profit manifests in a callous disregard for the well-being of their employees and the environment. \n\nSinclair vividly depicts the industrial landscape as a menacing force, \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery emphasizes the environmental devastation wrought by the factories, a consequence that the owners seemingly ignore.  The disregard for human life is equally apparent in their treatment of their workforce. They exploit their employees, demanding excessive hours and offering little protection or support. This exploitation is further highlighted by the quote: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"\n\nThe absence of adequate labor laws during this period allowed the owners to operate with impunity, treating their workers as expendable pawns in their quest for wealth.  The workers, trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and desperation, are left to fend for themselves amidst the harsh realities of Packingtown.  Their plight is further compounded by the failure of unions to offer meaningful assistance. In fact, Sinclair portrays these organizations as contributing to the problem, enriching themselves at the expense of the very people they supposedly represent.  The desperate circumstances faced by the working class are compared to slavery, highlighting the dehumanizing nature of their exploitation.  Sinclair states, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Authors often employ various literary devices to guide readers' emotions and perceptions of key themes. The effectiveness of these techniques can vary greatly. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of such strategies in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\" One notable approach involves pairing adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to evoke a specific ambiance surrounding a subject. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them to achieve a similar effect.  He skillfully employs this latter technique with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald meticulously constructs meaning associated with these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to trigger specific emotional responses in readers concerning significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with a sense of uniformity, with white connoting a certain elegance and refinement, while gray suggests a faded, antiquated quality. This association is established early in the novel through frequent depictions of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white\" (8), a common attire for all characters—Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine appears \"powdered milky white\" (30). The sole exception to this monochromatic palette occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies these color associations by applying them to commonplace objects and settings. As Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). At Gatsby's gatherings, the names of guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). Even ordinary individuals and places are rendered in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" by the railroad track is depicted as \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is characterized as \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established a clear semantic framework for white/gray, Fitzgerald strategically employs these colors to signify insignificance or uniformity in relation to specific subjects. This technique is notably employed in his portrayal of Daisy. After an extended period devoid of significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; this visual cue subtly transforms Daisy's perception from a distinct character into a more uniform, almost generic entity, representing an object of Gatsby's desire and longing (74).  Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy's homogeneity through additional instances of white and gray: \"a gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural prowess stems from its pleasant, sun-drenched climate.  A variety of crops thrive here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The area boasts a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture products, with numerous local organizations facing extended waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, alongside opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational pursuits.  This type of agricultural model presents a unique opportunity for landowners to capitalize on government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat, thereby fostering recreational use and creating avenues for farm tours and educational programs, potentially generating income or serving educational purposes.\n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in both plants and wildlife. This is due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming practices can come with higher costs compared to conventional methods.  Intensive labor and management are required to control pests and weeds, and to fertilize the soil without chemical inputs. Consequently, losses are frequently greater in organic farming compared to conventional approaches.  Furthermore, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.  Practices beneficial to wildlife, but unrelated to organic farming, can also add to labor costs. These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, managing invasive species, and actively shaping plant growth to create specific conditions, such as edge habitat or patches of open ground.  These factors highlight the reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise in maximizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen parcel of land is located adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It encompasses 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, as defined by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan.  Although the plan is currently under review, it already recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species that inhabit the area.  Many of these are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may face endangerment in the near future, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis region has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land, part of an original homestead patent, likely served purposes such as grazing and/or wood production for many decades.  \n\nThe selection of this property was based on research conducted on a real estate website. I then explored available government programs to understand the realistic options a small farmer might consider for cost mitigation and wildlife conservation.  As a model of potential outcomes, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The impact of cultural context on negotiation cannot be overstated.  Culture, a complex and multifaceted concept, is defined as much by its absences as its presences.  It resists simplistic categorization, defying neat labels and generalizations. Statements attributing uniform traits to entire nationalities, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are inherently reductive and ultimately unhelpful. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be a starting point, a truly effective negotiator delves deeper, understanding the specific cultural nuances relevant to the negotiation at hand and how they might influence the dynamics at play.\n\nEncountering a new culture inevitably involves personal reflection, as we naturally frame our experiences through the lens of our own cultural background. This can lead to comparisons, but it is crucial to avoid imposing our own cultural assumptions onto the situation.  \n\nComprehending a foreign culture or mindset requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical analysis, an awareness of its potential biases, and a willingness to approach it with open-mindedness.  Rather than seeking to judge or alter it, the key lies in acceptance and adaptation. Within the context of negotiation, particularly when facing a weaker bargaining position, respecting and working within the boundaries of another culture becomes paramount.  Navigating unfamiliar territory requires sensitivity to local traditions and beliefs, which can serve as bridges to overcome cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt's important to recognize that cultural influences extend beyond national boundaries.  Within any given nation, companies often cultivate their own distinct corporate cultures.  These cultures manifest in various ways, from work hours and dress codes to communication styles, delegation practices, and even philanthropic initiatives. The diversity of American corporate culture, ranging from demanding work environments to more relaxed settings, even within regions and urban versus suburban contexts, highlights the richness and complexity of cultural expressions.  While some cultures may appear more homogenous on the surface, this can be misleading, often masking a deeper layer of internal diversity.\n\nValues serve as the driving forces behind cultural behaviors, providing the \"why\" behind actions. Understanding these values is crucial in negotiation. For instance, a culture that prioritizes saving face or communal harmony might discourage public confrontations or criticism to avoid jeopardizing harmony. Conversely, a culture that values aggressive negotiation tactics might be less inclined to settle quickly.  \n\nWhile acknowledging these broader cultural tendencies is essential, a successful negotiator also benefits from gaining insights into their counterpart's individual values and motivations on a personal level. This personalized understanding can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation process.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. This very phrase serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of a higher power. Notably, this belief also resonates with another prominent figure, Thomas Aquinas, whom we will be analyzing.  \n\nSince both of these thinkers are defending the same concept – the existence of God, specifically the God depicted in the Bible – and our aim is to determine the strength of their respective arguments, we will, for the sake of clarity, assume they both hold this belief to be true.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison, as their arguments are fundamentally built upon this specific understanding.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge that neither argument ultimately provides a complete or irrefutable foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection in attaining knowledge of God. He posits that because God exists within our comprehension, we cannot fully grasp the idea of his non-existence. While his presentation can be dense and occasionally ambiguous, the core idea is that the proof for God's existence resides within our own minds.  Anselm suggests that we needn't rely on external evidence to discover truth about God; rather, the existence of this being is inherently known through what we inherently understand to be true within ourselves. This concept, often referred to as faith, involves accepting truths that lack concrete empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes a different path – one that relies entirely on reason and observable evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous for spreading religious belief, as it would allow individuals to be persuaded by logic alone, potentially broadening the appeal to those who might be hesitant to accept concepts that cannot be empirically proven. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the existence of God is logically necessary. He uses the analogy of a missing puzzle piece: even though we haven't directly observed it, the presence of the remaining pieces logically necessitates the existence of the missing one.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince who later became known as Buddha was born. His life journey led him to renounce worldly possessions and achieve enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada being its most traditional branch. This ancient religion, spanning roughly 2,500 years, has evolved significantly since Buddha's time.  \n\nThis evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Both monks and lay followers participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha not having explicitly mentioned such a celebration. These changes range from external practices to the very core tenets of the faith. \n\nOver time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines. This transformation can be attributed to both internal and external influences, some positive and others negative.\n\nIn this discussion, we'll frequently use specific terms to clarify our points. \"Internal\" refers to forces originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while \"external\" refers to influences from non-Buddhist sources.  \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community due to negative perceptions of Buddhism. \"Benign\" forces, on the other hand, have no intention of harming or aiding the community, though their actions might inadvertently lead to one or the other. These terms will recur throughout our analysis.\n\nTo begin, we'll examine the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"Triple Gem\" – the Buddha, the Dhamma (Buddha's teachings), and the Sangha (the monastic community). The Dhamma is essentially represented by the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures: the Sutta Pitaka (containing discourses), the Vinaya Pitaka (containing monastic rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (containing metaphysical teachings). These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and achieving enlightenment. Along with ending Sansara, one also transcends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) when enlightenment is attained. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living, with five precepts for lay followers (non-killing, non-lying, non-stealing, non-sexual misconduct, and non-consumption of intoxicating substances). Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules.\n\nThe most foundational principle in Buddhism is the concept of the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha – the reality of suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome. And fourth, there is a path to overcome suffering – the Eightfold Path.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico offers a compelling case study in the dynamics of interstate rivalry.  From 1836 to 1893, these two nations were locked in a protracted conflict, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). This period witnessed its most intense phase in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the United States emerged victorious, annexing Texas and the American Southwest.  Numerous other skirmishes ensued, finally subsiding before the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThe roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental differences between the two societies, encompassing religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests (Schmitt, 1974, pp. 30-31). This pattern of neighborly rivalry is not unique to the United States and Mexico.  Bordering nations often find their interests converging and diverging, leading to tensions and strained relations. Pletcher (1977) observes that the United States has faced enduring diplomatic challenges with Mexico and Cuba, both geographically proximate and historically adversarial (p. 41). In contrast, other Latin American nations have generally maintained amicable ties with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also played a significant role in dividing the two nations, a recurring theme throughout history.  Frahm (2001) highlights how, while Americans in the 20th century opposed fascism and communism, in the 18th and 19th centuries they were wary of Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86).  Echoing the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, the conflict with Mexico involved both ideological differences and competition for vital interests. However, in this instance, the ideological struggle centered on religious preferences rather than political systems.  \n\nThis distrust had its origins in the historical antagonism between England and Spain, whose colonial legacies cast a long shadow over relations between the United States and Mexico.  Diehl and Goerts (2000) catalogue 17 disputes between the two nations during this 57-year period, the majority stemming from territorial issues, including border raids and incursions. Banditry and outlaw activity from American border towns posed a persistent threat until both nations deployed military forces along their shared frontier (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico's economic dependence on the United States grew (p. 109), ultimately culminating in a shift in American interest from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico by the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected turn. An illness, unknown to me until then, brought my active life as a nurse to a sudden halt.  Nursing was a career choice I made as a young person, driven by a deep-seated need for stability and security, something I hadn't experienced growing up.  The advice I often heard was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\"  Though my true passions lay in science and journalism, perhaps a blend of both, the practicality of nursing seemed like the safer route.\n\nAnd yet, here I was at 46, single, with limited savings, and facing an uncertain future due to my disability. Fifteen years on Social Security Disability have left me with very little to call my own. Each day is a struggle to maintain my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing feels certain anymore.\n\nHowever, there is one truth that shines through: I wouldn't have survived these years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of dear friends.  No matter how strong I thought I was, facing a real crisis exposes the fragility of our human strength.\n\nLife is unpredictable. Emergencies, both big and small, are inevitable.  No matter how well we plan, some challenges are simply too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nI agree that we shouldn't solely rely on government assistance. It's clear that our current system has its flaws. Instead, I believe Americans need to rediscover the importance of community and mutual support. We should learn to trust each other, to offer help when needed, and to ask for help when we're struggling.  \n\nConservative rhetoric often glorifies \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our nation. However, the pioneers who traversed the rugged terrain of the American West didn't succeed through isolation. They thrived because of compassion, mutual respect, and the shared responsibility of looking out for one another.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit stocked with first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and even plastic sheeting and duct tape for potential emergencies. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods are all part of my preparedness plan.  If you have the means, consider growing your own food or learning preservation techniques.  A wood stove can be a valuable asset, though this might not be feasible for everyone. \n\nBut remember, preparedness isn't solely about gathering supplies. It's also about building strong connections with your neighbors.",
            "The evolutionary trajectory of organisms presents a compelling question: what factors guide their development? Though D'Arcy Thompson mused in 1917 that even the simplest life forms remain elusive in mathematical description,  modern science is striving to bridge this gap. Mathematical modeling has found application in understanding the broader aspects of mollusk skeletal development, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981).  Our research seeks to explore how these models, coupled with experimental investigations, can illuminate the mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in the genus *Prunum*.  \n\nUtilizing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantifiable parameters that form the basis for modeling both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). Through this, we constructed hypothetical shell morphologies, aiming to define the boundaries of possible morphological variation within *Prunum*. These findings are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain deeper insights into macroevolutionary patterns within this lineage.\n\nThe mollusk shell, in essence, can be conceptualized as a tube traversing a three-dimensional space over time. The revolutions or turns of this coiled structure are known as whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis termed the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand varies, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called the suture. Typically, the largest whorl, known as the body whorl, represents the final stage of shell growth. The spire, encompassing all whorls except the last, culminates in the apex, the tip of the spiral. In contrast, the base refers to the opposite end. The aperture, an opening, provides an exit for the animal inhabiting the shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards, is the most common orientation.\n\nDetermining the number of whorls involves visualizing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, with estimations made to a quarter whorl.\n\nViewing a shell as a sequence of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell provides a unique perspective. By tracing the path of the aperture using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a graphic and mathematical representation.\n\nThis mathematical formulation allows for the modification of parameters, enabling us to explore the potential variations in mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "The trends in neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. Despite the nation's progress toward achieving several Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have fallen short of the targets needed to reach the 2015 goals.  A deeper examination reveals the multifaceted reasons behind these shortcomings, suggesting a need to bolster the overall health system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criteria. However, this category encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the capacity to manage complications during pregnancy, contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths attributed to hemorrhage. Consequently, while this indicator shows progress, it provides a somewhat incomplete picture, highlighting the need for further improvements. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of children under five years of age with diarrheal illnesses receiving treatment from a healthcare professional.  Data on postnatal care remains limited, but it is evident that this area requires significant attention, with low utilization rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below what might be anticipated, hovering around 4%. These rates also reveal another concerning disparity. While cesarean-section rates stand at 7% in urban areas, they are significantly lower at 2% in rural communities. This disparity underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, with a concentration of resources in urban centers.  Another pressing issue is vertical equity, as there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles.  This suggests that accessing healthcare services presents a significant challenge for the impoverished, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, improving neonatal and maternal healthcare indicators necessitates addressing the fundamental issue of inadequate service provision.  Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overarching health system without concentrating solely on pre- and postnatal care?  Clearly, program-based solutions to the aforementioned challenges are appealing. \"Vertical\" approaches, focusing on specific areas of improvement, often yield faster results and offer more manageable objectives. However, it is crucial to consider potential drawbacks.  \n\nConcentrating resources on a single health sector can lead to a decline in funding and human resources allocated to other vital areas.  This is exemplified by the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on the family planning sector.  Moreover, implementing multiple parallel programs within a single area can result in duplicated services and a lack of coordination, leading to increased administrative burden and complexity in supply chains and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the upper classes of the era. However, there are notable exceptions to this trend, with novels like \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" breaking away from convention. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, a departure from the typical Victorian novel, which serves to deepen the characters and illuminate their motivations and emotions.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and nature of these moments differ. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these experiences frequently offer glimpses into Oliver's inner world, revealing his pain and his understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the dire state of his health, as evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, replaced by a constant, gnawing fear. This raises the question of whose will is responsible for Oliver's misfortune, for it certainly wasn't his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little agency, unable to exert even a modicum of control over his fate, even when his life hangs in the balance. A sense of defeat also emerges, suggesting that Fagin has begun to break Oliver, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that Oliver would have made some effort, if only to save himself.\n\nAnother example of this dreamlike state is found in \"Wuthering Heights\": “The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I volunteered at an after-school program designed to assist elementary school students. While I tried to help all the children with their academic challenges, I excelled at tutoring in English and reading. One instructor asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade, as he was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. I quickly realized something wasn't quite right; his reading comprehension presented unusual obstacles. He would pronounce some letters flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him – it was truly perplexing. I knew he was of Latino heritage, and while he spoke English fluently, his reading skills lagged behind. We struggled to make progress until the day Adrian's mother arrived. \n\nI was supervising a small group of children while the rest of the program participants were on a field trip when she walked in.  His mother only spoke Spanish, and my grasp of the language was limited, as I had only begun learning it. Nevertheless, we managed to communicate using a combination of broken Spanish and hand gestures.  That's when a crucial realization struck me: Adrian wasn't incapable of reading; he simply lacked a strong understanding of the English alphabet. Whether this insight ultimately helped him, I can't say for sure, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the pervasive issue of language barriers in our schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates the importance of recognizing that challenges often aren't as apparent as they seem. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can present formidable hurdles. I believe we can all agree that this issue exists, so the question becomes: what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring him in English reading, focusing on alphabet recognition and pronunciation. However, for children who have limited English proficiency, the solution is far more complex. There is no single, magic bullet. \n\nDual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes – none of these approaches, in isolation, can fully address this problem. The key lies in a multi-faceted approach that combines all of these strategies. \n\n[A dual language system, for instance, is a commendable concept.  It benefits not only children whose first language is Spanish, but all students. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" according to research. Many fear that such programs are a wasteful use of resources and that the majority of students will not reap any benefits. This is a misconception.  If we implemented these programs more widely, rather than as an exception, all children would benefit.  \n\nHow do we achieve this? We don't need to require all teachers to be bilingual, which would be an unreasonable and impractical expectation. However, I believe there is no reason why we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to provide support.",
            "From childhood, many of us are told about a force beyond our understanding, something vast and unknowable.  Some seek answers in organized religion, attending Sunday school or temple, while others find solace in introspection.  Tradition often guides our beliefs, leading us to embrace the faith of our upbringing. Yet, some reject these doctrines entirely, clinging to the certainty of their own limited perspective. Our values shift and evolve, reflecting a journey of self-discovery as we navigate the complexities of spirituality. We all yearn for a guiding light, a beacon in the darkness that illuminates our path.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird.  We sat on the porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop to our conversation. The overflowing gutters cascaded water onto the wilting plants lining the edge of the porch.  He gazed out at the downpour, his eyes holding a mixture of contemplation and nostalgia.  He had become increasingly frail, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair, once thick and full, now seemed sparse and wispy. He avoided my gaze, lost in the relentless rain.  I felt a wave of loneliness wash over me, a fear so profound that I couldn't bring myself to voice my impending grief.  To speak of it would only make the reality more unbearable for both of us.  Instead, I embraced him, settled back into my chair, and moved closer, joining him in his silent contemplation of the fading light.\n\nMy father died in December, just five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his suffering, extending his life beyond the doctors' initial prognosis, but at what cost?  The purpose of his prolonged pain eluded me.  \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered into the empty night, my prayers unanswered.  I had chosen not to witness his final moments, unable to bear the sight of life slipping away from the man who had brought me into this world. I wanted to remember him as he had lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone else, better even than his own family.  I was certain he wouldn't want me to be a passive observer at his death.  For three days, I retreated into my bedroom, curling up in a ball, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The concept of the \"Gothic Novel\" presents an intriguing paradox, as aptly described by Ian Watt in his work \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" It oscillates between the familiar and the novel, a blend of \"Old\" and \"New.\" This genre has faced a spectrum of critical responses, from derision and accusations of superficiality to fervent praise for its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, masterfully merges elements of both ancient and modern romances, establishing a new mode of literary expression. Walpole ingeniously combines traditional theatrical elements with a contemporary emphasis on naturalistic descriptions, as he himself labels it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic literary tradition draws heavily on the aesthetics and conventions of medieval Gothic architecture, theater, and customs.  Even at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, the term \"Gothic\" had already been applied to a diverse range of cultures, styles, and eras. It often carried connotations of archaicism or cultural inferiority in comparison to the perceived advancements of the modern era. \n\nThis juxtaposition of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into the characters' inner lives, contributes to the enduring appeal of the Gothic genre. It simultaneously feels both antiquated and refreshingly new to readers separated by time from its origins.\n\nA prominent theme recurring in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry.  Medieval notions of chivalry, the rigorous training of a knight, are both preserved and reinterpreted in Walpole's seminal work, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors due to its embodiment of idealized qualities like bravery, honor, and competence. These authors, particularly Walpole, often lament the perceived decline of these ideals in contemporary society. Through the invocation of chivalric principles and conduct, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the genre's evolution towards Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a vehicle to critique the present and aspire towards a more virtuous future.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of political turmoil and personal accusations, grappled with anxieties about the future. He may have, consciously or unconsciously, drawn a connection between the perceived moral integrity and inherent \"goodness\" of past eras and the perceived failings of modern society. This sentiment is evident in several characters, notably Frederic.  Before we even meet him, Frederic's character is imbued with chivalric attributes:\n\n[Insert the passage describing Frederic here]\n\nThis description is replete with traditionally chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has endured suffering and tragedy, is marked by the tropes of a \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" albeit exaggerated, foreshadowing the Gothic tendency towards excess (66).",
            "The intricate dance of moving goods from initial concept to satisfied customer is known as supply chain management. Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this term encapsulates the delicate balancing act of planning, implementing, and controlling all stages – from raw materials to finished product delivery – to ensure customer needs are met with both speed and efficiency. \n\nAt its core, a successful supply chain rests on six fundamental pillars: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.  These elements, carefully orchestrated by skilled business managers, are the building blocks of superior customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial spark in this chain reaction, lays the groundwork for everything that follows. It dictates the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of creation, driven by a deep understanding of customer desires.  Market analysis becomes crucial here, acting as a compass guiding managers towards the products in highest demand.  Armed with this knowledge, they determine the precise quantities to be produced and the optimal location for manufacturing, factoring in both production volume and product quality to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce the production site is established, the focus shifts to meticulous scheduling and equipment maintenance. Every detail within production is a vital cog in the machine; neglecting any could result in costly delays and financial repercussions.  Consider, for example, the meticulous processes employed by retail giants like Walmart and Target. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, every aspect of their operations is meticulously documented, ensuring smooth workflow and clear expectations.\n\nThe second pillar, \"supply,\" encompasses the strategic choices made regarding a facility's core capabilities and its outsourcing partnerships.  A company might have multiple production divisions specializing in various aspects of a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise.  Here, the manager acts as a conductor, strategically assigning tasks to the most suitable division or, in some cases, outsourcing certain processes to external companies. This strategic outsourcing aims to enhance \"velocity\" - the ability to deliver quality products with flexibility while simultaneously minimizing costs.",
            "A street corner in a bustling city. A solitary figure stands, holding aloft a hand-made sign, its message stark and unsettling: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" This is Ellen Page, famed for her role in the film \"Juno,\" drawing attention to a distant and troubling reality. \n\nBurma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation currently under the control of a powerful military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup. In 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, marking the first public dissent in a decade. These demonstrations, led by Buddhist monks in their saffron robes, earned the name \"The Saffron Revolution.\"  Initially met with a degree of tolerance by the government, the situation quickly escalated into a violent confrontation. Monks were met with force, their peaceful gatherings disrupted, and monasteries were attacked. \n\nForeign journalists attempting to document the events were swiftly detained, with one, Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, tragically losing his life on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a protest. While official figures claim a comparatively low death toll of 13, a defected colonel from the Burmese army, Hla Win, asserted that the true number was far higher, citing thousands of casualties. \n\nSadly, this pattern of brutal suppression of dissent is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have sought to maintain absolute control over their populations, often resorting to violence and intimidation. From the Roman emperors who claimed divine authority to the Japanese emperors revered as deities, and even contemporary leaders who wield power with an iron fist, the desire for absolute control remains a persistent threat to freedom.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 stands as a chilling reminder of this dark reality. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered in the heart of Beijing to express their dissatisfaction with the government's authoritarian rule. The official death toll remains shrouded in secrecy, with conflicting reports suggesting a significantly higher number of casualties. \n\nAnother horrific example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically slaughtered Tutsis and moderate political figures.  And of course, the atrocities committed by Hitler's Nazi regime during the Holocaust, where millions of Jews were murdered, serve as a stark reminder of the depths of human cruelty.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the realm of jazz is largely attributed to both his prolonged career and his exceptional aptitude for molding his musical ensemble. While his pianistic contributions may not be overtly prominent in the compositions selected for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his ability to craft intricate and multifaceted musical pieces that allowed each band member to showcase their individual talents.  Ellington established a framework within which soloists could freely improvise, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically catered to the unique styles of his musicians, thereby highlighting specific musical concepts. This approach also served to define the overall tone of the orchestra, resulting in cohesive and original sonic textures tailored to each composition.  Through his mastery of individual instrumental voices and their integration within the evolving ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative spirit, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his lifelong practice of utilizing vocalization \"as a jazz instrument.\" This early work exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating voice to enrich texture and color without relying on lyrical content. \"Creole Love Call\" also exemplifies Ellington's skill in complementing the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his career. This languid, measured twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between vocals and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions to a more raspy sound towards its conclusion. \n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the fundamental melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo performed in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano passage.\n\nChorus 4: The full band replicates the first chorus, with a call-and-response pattern executed by the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections. \n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response exchange between vocals and reeds. In this iteration, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, functioning as an instrument during the solo.\n\nTag: A brief concluding section featuring a vocal flourish and a dissonant, novelistic ending provided by the trombone.\n\nEllington's artful utilization of voice to add another dimension of tonal color to this piece is but one example of a stylistic hallmark that permeates his entire body of work. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his talent for meticulous orchestration with his keen ear for tonal nuances. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing seamlessly merges the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental facets of Cox's voice, generating a rich and complementary sonic tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, as Ellington expertly employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart in Ellington's orchestra, to deliver the melody on muted trombone with exceptional effect.",
            "A persistent void had always resided within her, an unyielding longing that refused to be satiated. This yearning first emerged during her adolescence, around the age of fourteen, and three years later, at seventeen, it remained an undeniable presence.  Over time, she realized her desire wasn't for material possessions but for companionship, a connection she hadn't found with anyone, not even the boys who occasionally expressed interest. They made their clumsy attempts at courtship, but she remained unmoved. This peculiar phenomenon puzzled her, prompting constant introspection and attempts to decipher its cause. Years of pondering yielded several theories, but none that felt convincing enough to warrant serious consideration. So, she navigated life, perpetually wrestling with the enigma of her desires.\n\nHer daily life at home was typically tranquil. Her parents, both inherently calm and composed, rarely engaged in arguments, and disagreements with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their sole point of contention stemmed from her insistence on independence and expressive personality. Despite their serene nature, she countered their balanced energies with an exuberance and infectiously fun demeanor, making her a genuinely likable individual, a quality further enhanced by her inherent kindness.\n\nHowever, today's atmosphere was anything but serene. As she wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, a sharp cry pierced the air, her mother's melodious voice laced with distress. She rushed to the kitchen, panic rising within her as she cried, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?\"  She found her mother lying on the ground, writhing in apparent pain, uttering short, pained gasps. Her daughter immediately knelt beside her, reaching out to offer comfort. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the... hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words fragmented and strained.  Her daughter understood the gravity of the situation. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mother weakly gestured, and in that moment, the daughter was acutely grateful for the physical training she had undertaken. She carefully lifted her mother, placing her gently in the car's backseat, and drove them to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a symphony of disinfectant and sickness, tinged with an underlying fear. However, her daughter was too consumed with her mother's well-being to notice. She rushed her mother inside and immediately summoned medical assistance. A cluster of concerned faces gathered around as someone swiftly procured a gurney and laid her mother upon it. They whisked her away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to sit anxiously in the waiting area.\n\nHer mother's injury stemmed from a fall from a stepladder while attempting to reach a vase from the top shelf of their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the link between adherence to a dietary pattern known as the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths.  A specific measurement, the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" was used to gauge how closely individuals followed this dietary pattern. The aMed diet is a refined version of the Med diet, emphasizing plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting saturated fats and animal products. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a correlation between adhering to a Med diet and a reduced risk of both overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each participant six times based on their responses to food frequency questionnaires (\"FFQs\") designed to assess their dietary intake over the preceding year.  More than 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this duration. The accuracy of the FFQs was confirmed through validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by examining medical records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, diagnoses were considered \"probable\" and included in the study, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. \n\nFor each FFQ, factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed. To account for individual variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated the average aMed score across two consecutive years. \n\nTo minimize the influence of confounding factors (variables that could potentially distort the results), adjustments were made for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to analyze the association between the aMed score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke occurrences.\n\nThe findings revealed that a higher aMed diet score, indicating greater adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, was associated with a lower risk of developing both CHD and stroke in women.  Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a period of significant economic hardship in the United States.  Unemployment rates surged, the housing market experienced a dramatic downturn, and several prominent corporations faced severe financial distress. This economic downturn continues to have lingering effects, prompting an examination of its origins and potential solutions. At the heart of this crisis lies a complex interplay of factors, including risky lending practices and a vulnerable financial infrastructure. \n\nThe government's encouragement of sub-prime lending, coupled with the pressure on entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to package these mortgages into complex financial instruments, played a crucial role. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, a ripple effect was triggered, destabilizing the financial system and spreading the crisis throughout the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration.  The administration's pursuit of economic growth and increased homeownership led to the relaxation of lending standards. This, unfortunately, created an environment ripe for the sub-prime mortgage crisis that unfolded years later.  Journalists, such as Steven Holmes of The New York Times, at the time raised concerns about the potential consequences of these relaxed regulations, predicting a possible financial crisis reminiscent of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\n\nThe complex nature of mortgages in the years leading up to the crisis further exacerbated the situation.  Innovations like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) interconnected various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This interconnectedness resulted in excessive reliance on the housing market, leaving both households and financial institutions vulnerable to price fluctuations.\n\nThe bursting of the housing bubble exposed the fragility of this system. Financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. Major investment banks, including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, faced substantial distress, leading to mergers, bankruptcies, and increased government intervention.",
            "Exposition:  The Dreaded Battlefield of Storytelling\n\nExposition, that crucial juncture in a narrative, can be a double-edged sword.  On one hand, it's a chance to paint a vivid picture with your words, to captivate your readers with your mastery of language and your ability to transport them to another world. On the other hand, it can be the very thing that sends your audience reaching for the \"Back\" button, their eyes glazed over from an overload of information.  \n\nThe seasoned writer, Dr. Merlin, can attest to this struggle firsthand.  She's known to let out a frustrated cry when she encounters a deluge of exposition that drowns out the narrative flow.  The key, as any aspiring writer knows, is to \"show, don't tell.\"  Yet, even the most experienced authors can fall into the trap of long, meandering passages that lack action or tension.\n\nExposition, in essence, involves directly informing the reader about events, often in a straightforward manner.  Think of it as a character in a film delivering a lengthy monologue, spewing out a torrent of backstory or crucial details, reminiscent of the \"Ancient Mariner\" reciting his tale.  In fiction, it's the author taking on the role of the omniscient narrator, delivering information rather than allowing the story to unfold organically.\n\nLet's consider an example.  Imagine a story where a heroine's beloved is murdered.  Would you want the author to spend two pages simply stating facts about their relationship:  where and when they met, the extravagant wedding, the tragic demise?  Certainly not!\n\nInstead, you'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions.  You'd want to see how his presence enriched the heroine's life, how it shaped her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams. A well-crafted introduction to the husband would allow you to connect with him emotionally, to feel the depth of his love and the weight of his loss.\n\nThe point is, exposition should be used sparingly and strategically.  Don't simply state the facts; bring them to life.  Instead of summarizing a character's history, weave it into the narrative, revealing their complexities through their interactions, their choices, and their inner thoughts.\n\nRemember, as a writer, your goal is to engage your readers, to draw them into your world and make them care about what happens.  Don't let exposition become a barrier between you and your audience.",
            "I watched two local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011.  The first was a live report from NBC 4. The lead story involved a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed.  The segment, lasting about two minutes, provided limited details, stating that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and Hostettler apprehended. The coverage seemed appropriately concise given the developing nature of the story. \n\nThe next story focused on the shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers was critically injured and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. This story felt somewhat abbreviated, and I wondered if this was due to the race of the victim and the neighborhood where the incident occurred.  A pattern I've observed is that media coverage of crimes involving minorities often receives less attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims.\n\nThe third story addressed a gunshot hole found in a MedFlight helicopter. Details about the suspected location and the determination that a .22 caliber rifle bullet caused the damage were provided. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nNext, the news briefly touched upon the anticipated rain and thunderstorms for the weekend, mentioning expected temperatures in the mid to low eighties. The segment felt intentionally short, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nA story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was also covered. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around one hundred and fifty pounds.  The emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone seemed disproportionately long, which struck me as unusual.\n\nFinally, the news reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug trafficker. He had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio.  The use of \"300 months\" instead of the more common \"25 years\" felt odd, perhaps an attempt to emphasize the severity of the sentence. The mention of Rodriguez's Hispanic background seemed tangential to the story.",
            "The relationship between brothers is complex, characterized by a powerful and often unyielding connection.  This bond encompasses a spectrum of emotions, ranging from affection and admiration to envy and even cruelty. Brothers possess a unique understanding of each other, a level of insight that transcends typical relationships. They see their own reflection in their brother's eyes, not the image others perceive, but a truer, more authentic self.  It is in times of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether for good or ill. The intensity of these emotions inevitably carries a weighty consequence.  Comprehending the emotions that stem from this fraternal tie involves confronting the repercussions they bring. \n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" delves into this theme, exploring the turbulent emotions inherent in a brotherly bond. Set against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered scenery, two young brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile. The story culminates in a scene where profound disappointment collides with intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive. The narrative weaves together the protagonist's direct experiences and interactions with his brother, providing a glimpse into the protagonist's complex emotional landscape and his perception of the world around him. These factors profoundly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by a powerful emotion: pride.  From their initial outings together to their final, fateful adventure, a sense of resentment festers within the protagonist towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearns for a companion who can share in his outdoor pursuits, someone who can keep pace with him in physical challenges and adventures. This desire is unmet, as Doodle's physical limitations, stemming from a weak heart, make such activities impossible.  The protagonist's dreams of a brother who could join him in his explorations are shattered. This disappointment manifests as anger, even leading to a fleeting thought of harming Doodle. However, Doodle's innocent smile evokes a surge of affection in the protagonist, suggesting that his darker thoughts were ultimately fleeting. Deep down, a fundamental love for his brother persists.",
            "The human brain is a complex system responsible for processing and generating creative outputs. As technology evolved, so too did the analogies used to describe its function. Initially, comparisons were drawn to rudimentary tools like wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, later evolving to encompass the book and, in modern times, the computer. However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful for conceptualization, possess inherent limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where our organs translate physical stimuli – touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo a series of transformations within the brain, guided by intricate algorithms operating in both bottom-up and top-down fashions. Consider, for example, the image of a black box against a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes fundamental elements like color, orientation, and boundary delineations to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, leveraging prior knowledge and context, refines this recognition, distinguishing it as a solid box rather than a mere void.\n\nOnce processed to a certain level, an attentional gatekeeper determines the significance of the incoming signal and directs it towards appropriate cognitive processes.  While your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance downward, a healthy attentional filter prevents conscious awareness of each individual blade. Conversely, your name, spoken amidst a cacophony, is readily singled out. This selective filtering occurs across multiple processing stages, constantly modulating the flow of information.\n\nFor effective processing, information must first be stored. The brain employs various memory systems, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Encoding initiates this process, with different strategies employed for diverse sensory inputs. Verbal information, for instance, can be encoded structurally (based on visual appearance), phonemically (based on sound), or semantically (based on meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, holding information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical loop within a specific neuronal circuit. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be anchored in the structural organization of certain protein types.\n\nNumerous models attempt to decipher the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing inspiration from human memory retrieval patterns, computer science principles, and neurophysiological observations. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as interconnected nodes, with links signifying their relationships. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which, in turn, might be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel, *Brave New World*, a chilling critique emerges regarding the impending dangers of technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it.  The novel paints a picture of a society where communal harmony takes precedence over individual identity. From their earliest moments, citizens are meticulously conditioned to prioritize instant gratification above all else, becoming unwitting players in a larger societal game orchestrated by the omnipresent World Controller.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, particularly the concepts of homogenization and reification, Huxley’s anxieties surrounding the trajectory of these emerging systems become increasingly apparent. The novel's exploration of false consciousness, a key tenet of Marxist thought, is particularly striking. The general populace, preoccupied with personal gain, remains oblivious to the true power dynamics inherent in the economic structure. This ideological manipulation, akin to the control exerted over the proletariat in Marxist theory, is vividly depicted in the conditioning of *Brave New World’s* citizens.  The lower social castes, designated Delta, Gamma, and so on, lack independent agency; their desires are  shaped and amplified through hypnopædia, a technique that instills a fervent appetite for consumption and indulgence, ultimately serving the interests of the World Controller.  \n\nThe concept of hegemony, wherein a dominant group exerts control over subordinate groups, is also evident in this societal construct.  The lower classes remain unaware of the manipulative forces at play, effectively \"embracing an ideology that upholds this system\" - namely, capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, born with the capacity for awareness, choose to remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions.  Even characters like Bernard, an Alpha, barely challenge the status quo. The interactions between these social strata further underscore the perceived oppression inherent in this capitalist system.\n\nRelationships in *Brave New World* are strikingly superficial, lacking the depth and complexity often found in human connections.  Huxley seems to suggest that the confluence of technological advancement and capitalism simultaneously erodes individual freedom and self-expression.  Love and intense emotions are absent; interactions are reduced to mere transactions, often characterized by superficial observations of physical attributes.  The unquestioning acceptance of their assigned positions within the social hierarchy by each class further exemplifies the socioeconomic impact of capitalism.  Their unwavering obedience reflects a Marxist perspective on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal norms.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus, a common challenge for many students, including myself, has often presented a hurdle. During my first year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center.  Commuting from my home in Stuart Hall to classes held in distant locations, such as the Willard Building near the campus core, could easily consume up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when adverse weather conditions prevailed, which is frequent in our State College climate. Through conversations with a recent alumnus, not much older than myself, I learned that the East Halls dormitories were once isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of unused land. This expanse has since been transformed into a tapestry of athletic fields, imposing new structures including the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of apartment complexes. As our campus continues its expansion, traversing from one point to another becomes increasingly arduous. What, then, is the most effective solution to this mobility predicament? On a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a viable answer. However, the bicycle alone is insufficient. Students must embrace cycling, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who recently rekindled his passion for cycling after a several-year hiatus prompted him to ponder why he ever abandoned it.  “Bicycles are exceptional,” he remarked, “while for a period, cycling wasn't perceived as fashionable, it's undeniably the most practical means of transportation.”  Beyond its physical benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of travel.  A simple breakfast of oatmeal, accompanied by a moderate amount of exertion, can propel you over 30 miles.  Like many undergraduates, I now reside off-campus, located a comparable distance from the campus center as some dormitories.  The most astute decision I've made this year has been to acquire a bicycle.  Daily, I attend classes in Thomas Building, a location that typically requires a 25-minute walk from my residence. Cycling, however, can significantly reduce this duration to a mere 5 minutes, provided I maintain a brisk pace.  However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas Building from my home, is not always a smooth ride, whether on foot or bicycle.  Walking possesses its own merits, but personally, my schedule is too demanding to allow for extended walking periods.  Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole reliable option for reaching my classes.  Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30 to 40 minutes to my day, equating to over two and a half hours each week.  Adding to this the time required for walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, it becomes an unmanageable burden."

            "\n\tIn pursuing an education in social work, I intend to follow a career path with the Division of Family and Children Services to help children who have been abused or neglected; and to provide support for troubled families. Values that I can provide to the social work field include the following: service, respect, ethical nature, commitment to help improve relationships between others and to improve myself professionally to remain competent in my field. These core values are not just important to social workers; they are important to me personally. \n\n\tI have always wanted to help others, but I was unsure of the career path that I wanted to follow. Throughout my years in high school and college, I saw many individuals flee from their problems in denial and a few used coping mechanisms that were less than ideal. Because of situations that I have witnessed, I chose to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology. Still unsure of a career path, I decided to take a break once I graduated from Piedmont College in 2009. One day that summer, I visited a friend who introduced me to a sixteen year-old boy sitting nervously on her couch. She explained to me why he was visiting: to escape his abusive parents. The next day, I learned that he had called the police to his parent’s residence. To see if I could help in any way, I drove over to his parents’ house. Once there, I privately explained my concerns to the police and told them I had just graduated with a degree in Psychology from Piedmont College. The police requested that I talk to the parents since there was nothing that the law could do for the teenager. When I questioned the parents about the situation, they seemed nervous and used excuses to describe their son’s “manipulative” behavior for involving outside sources to resolve “simple” disputes. After this particular experience, I began to seriously consider a career in social work to help children with “simple” disputes among family members.\n\n\tAnother value that is important for the field of social work is social justice. As a society, we claim that the individual is important and we mourn those that we have lost. The concept of the “individual” that society holds is more a follower of archaic traditions than actual uniqueness. So, if society mourns lost individuals, then why do we strive to be similar to “everyone else?” I am an individual and do not enjoy placing limitations on myself to be similar to others. Throughout my years at high school and college, I protested against social injustice whenever I could: coloring my hair unnatural colors, wearing clothing that fit my personality, piercing my ears past the traditional set, declaring my involvement with GSBA (Gay Straight Bisexual Alliance), fighting against both racism and discrimination whenever I witnessed it, etc. I believe in social justice and I will continue to protest against social injustice.\n",
            "\n\n\n\tThe following paper addresses the Biological and Sociocultural models in relation to the disorder insomnia. The biological model focuses on genetic information that is inherited as well as medical aspects of health. The Sociocultural models look at environmental relationships and their applications to race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status. The following review of insomnia looks at these models and explains each piece of research chosen to relate to and to better explain the models. The explanations of the research and their findings are then critiqued to mention their specific strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA sleep disorder can be characterized as a primary sleep disorder, a sleep disorder related to another mental disorder, or a sleep disorder related to other issues. The Primary sleep disorders are Dyssonmias or Parasomnias while sleep disorders related to another mental disorder are related to an Axis I or Axis II disorder. Other categories of sleep disorders can be due to medical complications or the intake of a substance. The Dyssomnias are: Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing- Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). While Primary Insomnia is a complication in adequate or maintained sleep, Primary Hypersomnia is a difficulty in staying awake, both for at least a one month period of time. Narcolepsy involves cataplexy and/ or automatic REM. While Dyssonmias focus on initiating and remaining asleep, the Parasomnias are sleep disorders associated with behavioral abnormalities and/ or physiological occurrences. Parasomnias are Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. The sleep disorders related to another mental disorder involve sleep difficulties due to Axis I (Clinical Disorders) or Axis II (Personality Disorders or Mental Retardation). The following review focuses on insomnia, and somewhat on primary sleep disorders in general in relation to the biological and sociocultural models.\n\n\t The biological model of sleep disorders focuses on genes, heritable factors, and physiologically acquired aspect of sleep disorders. Neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin are responsible for the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. This study experimented with mice and found that there are phenotypic GABAB receptors on the orexin neurons which are specifically responsible for sleep/ wake states. The activation of the GABAA receptor induces responses that promote sleep. If it is inhibited from firing, this can cause reduced anxiety and induce sleep. The GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep time (Matsuki et al., 2009). Such results imply that the animal models of mice can be generalized to studies in humans. This shows that there is a genetic and environmental basis for the physical GABAB receptor in humans. A problem or absence with this receptor could alter the ability of one to have adequate sleep without medication. The sociocultural implication of this study is that if the phenotype was inherited, this could regulate sleep, and an alteration of the receptor would naturally disturb sleep for an individual. This would negatively impact aspects of life such as school, career, and every day events that involve monotonous tasks and focus. ",
            "\n\n\nThis paper covers three areas of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD). First, a brief definition of the disorder is provided. Next, diagnosis is explained, with common characteristics, or “red flags”. Finally, the paper concludes with ways that a teacher in a mainstreamed classroom environment can assist a student with CAPD.\n\n\tCentral Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) “refers to the efficiency and effectiveness by which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information. Narrowly defined, (C)AP refers to the perceptual processing of auditory information in the CNS and the neurobiologic activity that underlies that processing and gives rise to electrophysiologic auditory potentials” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005), meaning it is a disorder wherein the central nervous system (i.e. the brain) cannot properly process things that are heard. People with CAPD can hear normally, and are therefore not considered “hearing impaired”; rather, the area of the brain that translates what we hear, separating words or differentiating conversation from background noise does not function as it typically should. \n\n\tThe earliest mention of the disorder that became CAPD is from the mid-1950s, called “auditory imperception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005) when researchers were evaluating children with communicative disorders. The Italian research team of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari began developing tests for these children in 1954; in 1961, Kimura “introduced dichotic testing and formulated a model to explain the physiology of the CANS underlying dichotic perception” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference was held in 1977 that stimulated research on children with CAPD. \n\n\tCAPD manifests itself in multiple ways: the person suffering may not be able to localize or hear sound in space; may have difficulty discriminating between two or more “acoustic events” (sound occurrences); may not be able to recognize sound patterns; may not be able to differentiate changes in speech (like detecting sarcasm based on change of voice); one sound may be blocked by a subsequent sound; may not have the ability to synthesize sound clues (that is, interpret in a meaningful way that they can then act upon); and may not be able to determine the sequence in which auditory information is presented (Ferre).\n\n\tIn order to diagnose CAPD, the patient must be screened with “systematic observation of listening behavior and/or performance on tests of auditory function”, which may be conducted by “audiologists, SLPs, psychologists, and others using a variety of measures that evaluate auditory-related skills” (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This may include questionnaires and surveys, observation of auditory behaviors, including how the patient responds to certain stimuli. There is, at this time, no one tool or test that is used consistently to a high rate of diagnostic success, and there is no known cause for the disorder. Many tests used present the patient with multiple, simultaneous auditory stimuli and then ask for them to differentiate certain items, like a series of words or numbers. More advanced tests include recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to the signals. ",
            "\nThe play Twelfth Night seems to say that although disguise is in fact useful in perpetrating long bouts of deception, in the end a person must reject that newly formed guise, or else risk losing themselves forever in the process. A big problem with ending a deception, however, is that one may find themselves alienated in the process. Therefore, in the end, one must decide between one’s own self preservation, or the preservation of relationships with those around them. For although some will respond neutrally to discovering that they’ve been tricked, still others will not take the deception so lightly, and will be likely be offended by the whole charade.\nThe topic of deception in gender role reversal is especially problematic, because it brings up many side issues, perhaps the most important one being, why? Why does the subject feel the need to shirk their own identity and take up a disguise in the form of the opposite gender? In Viola’s case, it is obviously a form of self protection.: “I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…” (5.1.247-249)\nHaving newly arrived in a foreign land, Viola feels it necessary to pretend to be a man to protect herself from would be attackers. Viola’s plan works, but it also alienates her from the women around her, cutting her off from an important support system. To make matters worse, she is apparently so convincing at appearing to be a man that Olivia confuses her with Sebastian, and in effect falls in love with her. “Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.” (5.1.138) On top of that, she also has to deal with suppressed romantic desires between her and Orsino: “Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.” (5.1. 260-261)\nAlthough this may be a somewhat progressive attitude, to the modern reader, Twelfth Night may be seen as an illustration of how deception may help facilitate the unveiling of suppressed emotions, especially in the cases of Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages seem to hint that the aforesaid characters may have unexpressed subconscious desires that the appearance of Viola/Cesario forces them to deal with. For instance, is Olivia attracted to Cesario because Cesario appears to be a man, or does Olivia really secretly harbor feelings for women? One would argue that this is probably not the case, because Shakespeare’s character Olivia seems more likely to be parodying those people of his time period who judge others only upon their looks. \nThis is evidenced by the ease with which Olivia switches her romantic ardors from Cesario to Sebastian, and begins to regard Cesario/Viola as family rather than a love interest: “A sister, you are she.” (5.1.315)\n",
            "\n\n\tGerman colonial rule has been noted by various observers for its brutality, notably with respect to the genocide of the Ovaherero and Nama in German South West Africa. Of course nothing so broad as an entire colonial empire can be accounted for by such a simple description. The German colonial empire was as varied in policies and ruling style as it was in geography. Educational provision across the colonies was similarly diverse. When the British took over German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they found a large population of educated and literate Africans. German educational efforts in Kamerun and other colonies were also praised by contemporary authors. \nThe situation in South West Africa (present-day Namibia) presented a stark contrast.  Unlike in East Africa, where the government established state schools and played a prominent role in the education of the natives, in South West Africa the task of native education was left almost entirely to missionary societies that received limited government support. The government did however invest significant resources towards the education of Europeans in the colony, establishing s system of state schools as well as more heavily supporting and regulating missionary schools. These educational policies had longstanding effects on South West Africa, even after German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, in South West Africa “the overwhelming majority of the population remained untouched, uneducated, and illiterate.” Various social, political, and economic factors led to the divergent experience of South West Africa. This paper seeks to expand the discussion by identifying these factors and paying particular attention to new research on the attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities to native Africans.\nThere is a wealth of literature dealing with education in the German colonial empire specifically. Most of these sources are in German and were written in the early twentieth century, during or shortly after the period of German colonial rule. The aim of early works was primarily to describe the features of educational systems in these colonies. Later writings in English expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education in the various German colonies and more detailed analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies illustrated significant differences in the educational systems of different colonies. The most prominent work to explicitly address the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of the two colonies and discusses the factors that account for the differences between them. According to Cohen, the large settler population of South West Africa explains many of the distinguishing aspects of the colony’s educational system.\nCompared to Germany’s other colonial possessions, South West Africa had a moderately temperate climate, although much of the territory is covered by arid desert. The European population of South West Africa reflected the relatively hospitable conditions. By 1913 nearly 15,000 whites lived in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in the colony with the next largest settler population, East Africa. ",
            "\n‎\t‏The classification of Popular Music has grown over the past‭ ‬100‭ ‬years to include so many genres that it is difficult to definitively list them all. Complicating matters,‭ ‬most if not all genres—rap,‭ ‬rock,‭ ‬country,‭ ‬jazz,‭ ‬folk,‭ ‬just to name a few—have spawned multiple sub and sub-sub genres within their domain.  Arguably the sub-genre of Heavy Metal rock has become one of the most diverse and expressive genres of all popular music in the past‭ ‬40‭ ‬years. It is expressive because it displays a wide range of emotions,‭ ‬although they tend to lean toward the darker side of the spectrum. It is diverse in that quite soon after the beginnings of the genre,‭ ‬people started to realize that it had real flexibility and started to take advantage of it to create their own sub-genre,‭ ‬which then was followed by sub-sub-genres,‭ ‬and the chain continues until today. \n\nToday we have reached a point in the heavy metal movement where there are so many niches of groups that it is hard to determine what exactly heavy metal is. It has grown to incorporate so many themes from other genres,‭ ‬but like everything else,‭ ‬it spawned from somewhere. In order to properly understand the metal music that exists everywhere today,‭ ‬one must first understand what the metal movement is,‭ ‬and why it’s a movement rather than just a genre.\n\n‎\t‏Metal is,‭ ‬in many ways,‭ ‬a movement defined by darkness. Metal can be considered a‭ “‬music of more‭”—‬more bass,‭ ‬more volume,‭ ‬more violence,‭ ‬more theatricality. Less primitivism,‭ ‬more chops‭; ‬people in metal bands really know how to play their instrument,‭ ‬and it comes through in the music. Metal is also—although it may not come as a surprise—a movement that is heavily drug induced. There was a psychedelic drug boom in the mid-70‭’‬s that led to people getting crazier,‭ ‬leading to them to make crazy,‭ ‬other-worldly records,‭ ‬using the drugs as a scapegoat for their creation. It possesses many dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities,‭ ‬which was very new to the music scene because a large amount of popular music had qualities that weren’t true to the darker side of the emotional spectrum. Also,‭ ‬later generations of metal have taken some of their influence from the dark,‭ ‬visceral qualities that were so present in the Romantic Era. Lyrics such as the following express the darkness that is such a staple of the movement:‭ (‬Byrne‭)‬\n\n\n\t\nThese lyrics from Helter Skelter display the darker side of the Beatles. It exhibits an up and down,‭ ‬supposedly that of drugs. This song is considered by some to be one of the first Heavy Metal songs. It was a response to a Rolling Stones song that was also on the heavier,‭ ‬darker side. The Beatles wanted to prove that they could be just as heavy as the Stones,‭ ‬so they put that song on‭ ‬The White Album.",
            "\nA few decades before the Surrealist artists began painting their dreamlike works, the artist Henri Rousseau was carefully crafting his own dreams, literally and figuratively. The Dream, a 1910 painting by the famous Post-Impressionist artist, represents not only a woman in awe at the wonders of the land she visits within a dream, but also Rousseau’s own personal dreams and goals as a painter. Since beginning his work, he dreamed of recognition, acceptance, and praise by other artists and art lovers, and found that he was faced with a difficult internal dilemma to achieve this aspiration. The Dream is Henri Rousseau’s work that best reflects his career-long internal struggle: to either conform to or mimic certain styles of painting in order to be accepted by the critical art world he so adored, or to allow himself to be creatively independent and unique, leaving his own path as he went.\nBefore one can analyze The Dream through this perspective, one must first be somewhat familiar with Rousseau’s biographical story. Henri Rousseau was born on May 21, 1844, in the town of Laval in northwest France. His father was a tinsmith and hardware dealer who “enjoyed bourgeois prosperity” (Shattuck 47). Growing up, he received no formal training in the arts; instead, he was employed until the age of forty working for France as a gabelou, or employee of the municipal toll service, although he received the misnomer sobriquet of douanier, a customs inspector (Shattuck 46). The death of his first wife, Clémence, which followed the deaths of eight infant children, left Rousseau with only one child, a daughter named Julia, and immense grief (Shattuck 49). He therefore hoped to take refuge in a new life and pursued painting to offer him comfort and fresh beginnings. Unlike contemporary colleagues of Rousseau who sentimentalize and romanticize the peasant in painting, he is essentially a folk painter and has the hopes and dreams of the average member of his class.\nRousseau’s obsession with being accepted by the art world is somewhat understandable when evaluated in context: as discussed, he was not only uneducated in the ways of formal painting and began his career at a much older age, but he was producing works at the same time as many other talented and better-known modern artists. Though working for many years already, Rousseau did not begin to receive proper recognition for his art until around the same time that Matisse had begun crafting a reputation as an artist. In the book Modern French Painters, author Jan Gordon asserts that the two, while technically competitors in the art arena, were different not only in style and subject matter but also their reasons for painting in the first place: “Matisse was a painter who conceived a terror of painting in a trite way, while Rousseau’s desire was to paint a picture so conventional that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français” (92).\n",
            "\n\tMany a great thinker has postulated an intimate connection between ethics and aesthetics, between truth and beauty. I believe that at a fundamental level there is a reason for this. As John Keats says in “Ode on a Grecian Urn”, “Beauty is truth, truth beauty- That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Much of what we know in life is learned via education or experience. However, we seem to appreciate ethics and aesthetics, as Keats implies, without being taught in these expected ways. Both ethics and aesthetics are an attempt to describe rather then prescribe. Our studies of morality and beauty are, for the most part, attempts to explain why a piece of art or literature is beautiful, or why an action is moral, rather than a set of rules for judging, or creating, good art or moral behavior. \n\tMore to the point, criticism of art or morals is never able to fully capture the essence of what is good or what is beautiful. A conversation about the worth of da Vinci's Mona Lisa, for example, may center around concepts like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, but in the end, these do not describe why it is good art. Rather, when one is asked about a favorite work of art or literature it is common to hear a phrase similar to, “There's just something about it” preceding a more complex or critical explanation. I believe that both art and morals can never be completely reduced to a description of their qualities. As Flannery O'Connor says, “A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.” No matter how completely we describe the properties of a work of literature, there is something transcendent which is still left. I believe that ethics has this same property. As Wittgenstein says, “It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental. / . I suggest that it is this “something”, this je ne sais quoi, which is art and morality's most powerful attribute, and that this transcendental nature of both ethics and aesthetics provides a connection point between them.\n\tI believe that morality and art are so closely related because we experience both of them most powerfully at a noumenally, to use a Kantian term. They impact us at a level that can be experienced, but not fully explained. This link is even stronger when it comes to the art of literature. As McKean says, “What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there” .\n",
            "\nThe Germany of today is considered a strong force, a united country with its own blend of culture from within the shadows of the alps in München, all the way to Baltic sea city of Kiel.  The same culture can be felt from Köln on the river Rhine, through the centre of Germany to the Saxon city of Dresden located on the Elbe. With such a unique culture, it shouldn't be surprising that Germany as we now know it comes from several different sources, and tribes. \n\nGermania is the ancestral land of the Germans. The origins of the name are highly disputed among scholars and historians. Tacitus claimed that the name came from a Germanic Tribe known then as Tungrians, and that they had previously been known as Germans before they crossed the Rhine and battled the Gaulish forces (Tacitus, 98.) Julius Caesar first used the word “Germanus” in his commentary on the Gallic Wars where he put down the Gauls and battled with Germanic tribes which crossed the Rhine often under mischievous premisses. He took this word from The Gauls themselves, and used it to distinguish between those which he had conquered (The Gauls) and those which he had not. While the origin is uncertain, some believe it referred to a neighbor in the Gaulish language. In the first chapter, of his first book on these wars, Julius Caesar notes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles.” (Julius Caesar, 50-40 BC) Others claim the meaning comes from the spear that they used in warfare, known as a ger (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word garim meaning “to shout”, which indicated the Germans were loud, or noisy. (Names of Germany) \n\n The early Roman historian Tacitus recorded in his AD 98 writing “De Origine et situ Germanorum”, which told of the origins of the Germans, that “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?(SIC)” (Tacitus, 98) \n\nAnd who would leave Rome for Germania? Certainly not the Romans, not yet at least. They would send out their conquests into the lands of Germania for goods, and lead the occasional land campaign but in the end they mostly returned back home to their sprawling empire. So as the Germanic tribes began appearing in the middle of the first century, they lived on the borders of the Roman Empire and traded their goods taken from the land, and their skills by serving within the ranks of the Roman army, (Ozment, 2005 pg. 17.)",
            "\nDownwards I stared, mind blankly comprehending the view in front of me.  Unemotionally, silently, with a practiced awareness that studied but refused to relate the object of study to any abstract understanding my mind analyzed the picture before my eyes.  Thoughts slipped into my mind and slipped out again almost faster than they appeared.  So smoothly and so cleanly my consciousness worked that it seemed I had no real thoughts of my own, just an active and liquid experience of what I was looking at. \nOnce, on advice from an artist I worked with, I purchased an art instruction book called The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.   I had wanted to learn how to draw ever since I was six years old and this book teaches everything from understanding what a pencil is to processes the brain uses to interpret lines.  One technique the book teaches is to place a square frame around any picture the artist wishes to study.  Thus transforming an overwhelmingly detailed picture, for instance a bowl of fruit sitting on a table located in a kitchen that is connected to a dining room, into an easily grasped picture, that bowl of fruit sitting on a simple plane.   \nAt the time, staring down at the bowl in front of me I could not mentally project that artist’s frame.  I was so overwhelmed, so awed that I could only stand and gaze in wonderment.  Picasso went through his blue phase, Monet loved greenery, Italian Renaissance masters displayed a rainbow of colors. If I had any pretensions of casting my perspective as worthy of the title Artistic then before me were the beginnings of my picture, the start of my story, Work in Brown.  \nFingertips alighted on my chosen implement of artistry, muscles tightened and relaxed as my hand passed through space, my mind’s will given shape and form in what could have been the most creative moment of my life.  Water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean.  Flakes of matter broke away from the whole and were carried away to nothingness.  Muscles tightening, jerking and spasming a little more quickly and anxious the second time, my hand smacked the handle of the toilet again.  The offensive brown package refused to move, stuck like a slug on the bottom of the toilet.  \nMop gripped loosely in hand, feet set a foot apart, green tie knotted uncomfortably around my throat, I frowned slightly as I stared at the rude bundle of processed animal and plant matter someone had left as a message for the suckers who cleaned the bathrooms at Rite Aid.  A few flushes more, a few more tranquil introspective moments to myself, then my hand moved towards the wall to my right, gripped the sheet at the end of the toilet paper, and began mummifying itself until it resembled an oven mitt.   Standing up straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a mother going into an oven for the Thanksgiving turkey….\n",
            "\nTeenagers are dying behind the wheel.  Several factors come together to create this deadly vector of statistics for the youngest American drivers.  The National Institutes of Health explain that one facet of the problem is that the teen brain is literally not ready for the hazards of driving. Simple inexperience also lies at the heart of the problem. This inexperience not only causes more fatal accidents, but also a higher rate of vehicle rollover, speeding, and driving off the road.  \nTeens also fare far worse when they travel with their peers—which anyone with an iota of sense knows they do on a regular basis.  The Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center conducted a study that showed the following correlation: between the age of the passenger and the number of traffic accidents occurring.\n\tCalifornia and other states have attempted to increase the safety of teen drivers by requiring temporary provisional licenses that limit the hours that teens may drive and prohibit other minors as passengers.\n\tBut provisional driver’s licenses are, in my opinion, stopgap measures.  The real issue is that—as a group—the youngest drivers are, by all statistical markers, simply not able to adequately handle the risks and responsibilities.  Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman believes even 18 is too young for a regular driver’s license.  USA Today reports that Zuckerman has performed research suggesting a common desire among those under the age of 19-20 to take risks for the sheer thrill of the sensation.  It makes sense then, to delay driving at least until the tendency to thrill-seek has begun to level out.  If we continue to issue driver’s licenses to young teens, we will not only continue to see deadly accidents happening, but the death toll is likely to reach staggering proportions in the next few years.  By 2010, the Baby-Boomer’s babies will be eligible to drive and millions of new teen drivers will ready to hit the road.  \nLegislation dealing with this issue would be reasonably straightforward.  Schools could continue to provide driver’s education classes to begin the learning process for future drivers, but no one under the age of 18 could operate a motor vehicle.  A provisional permit could still be issued prior to granting a full driver’s license, and a certain number of practical driver’s training hours would still be required as well.  The specific number of hours required could be based on the number of hours already required by the majority of states (in California, for example, that number is currently 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of practice with an adult.)  Because the deadly statistics for teen drivers come from a cross-section of all states, uniform, national legislation on this issue would be a reasonable—and I believe effective—means of protecting teens across the nation. \nThe legislation I suggest is by no means a novel idea.

            "\nIn looking through the Library of Congress’s library of early Edison films, I decided to view all of the trick films, of which there were fifteen from 1895 to 1901. These films generally take advantage of creative editing to produce illusions. My film study generally focused on describing the poetics for the majority of trick films and examining the evolutionary outlier characteristics present in a few of the later films. Largely, the trick film at the turn of the century is set-bound, composed within a frontal proscenium, features no camera movement, uses long and medium shots, and adheres to the strict one shot = one film methodology. However, there are some films at the beginning of the twentieth century that dare to break these guidelines by introducing aspects such as multiple shots.\nOne of the most noticeable aspects that the trick films share in common is their filming in an interior set within the frame of a frontal proscenium. The camera does not move from its proscenium position to follow figures or objects. This composition was very common in early films, and drew its root from the theatre and, for trick films, vaudeville and magic acts. One of the limitations inherent in the use of the stage is that figures in trick films generally only move side-to-side, and do not walk towards or away from the camera. Take, for example, the action in the film Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel (1900). The actors enter from the right side and move back and forth along the horizontal axis. Even as they go out of the frame, the camera does not follow them.\nThe frontal proscenium style of composition also means that shots tend to be long shots and, more rarely, medium shots. Close-up shots are never used in any of the trick films from the Edison catalog. This borrows from the theatre and vaudeville tradition, where the audience would see the entire performance at any given time, framed by the borders of the stage. As in most early films, the actors do not move from the middle ground towards the camera, so close-ups never occur.\nGenerally, most early trick films follow the pattern that one conceptual shot equals a film. This limits the length of most trick films to about a minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also limits the dramatic or narrative usage of the trick films; most of them focus on short vaudeville-style tricks, such as magic, disappearing, and switching acts with little story. Note, however, that in a trick film, one conceptual shot in the viewer’s eyes does not actually equal one physical shot. A single “shot” may actually be several joined together to produce the illusion of apparition or disappearing. Look carefully at The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), one of the earlier trick films. A more thorough inspection reveals the moment where the physical shot with Mary’s severed “head” begins, even though the whole film is conceptually one shot to the viewer. ",
            "\n‎\t‏John Taylor of Caroline was an early and ardent proponent of Republicanism.  Though he was primarily an agriculturalist,‭ ‬that very profession along with his brief career in politics created a man known for his dedication and outspokenness in matters of personal freedom and government.  His dedication to an agrarian system was the basis for almost all of his opinions concerning the government.  It was his attempt to preserve and encourage what he considered the most superior of all careers that colored his arguments on sovereignty,‭ ‬Constitutionality,‭ ‬and even the judicial system.\n‎\t‏John Taylor believed that the United States had a great opportunity to create an ideal system,‭ ‬because there was no native tradition to hinder the creators of the government,‭ ‬which allowed for the establishment of a system of self-government.  He believed strongly in the natural rights of man,‭ ‬and in the fact that they are all interdependent—meaning that if one is denied,‭ ‬then they all will fail,‭ ‬and the value of those remaining is lessened.  These rights should therefore be beyond the reach of the government.  He claimed that what some called the‭ “‬state of nature‭” ‬meant that those with physical prowess and malevolent intelligence were the ones that profited,‭ ‬but that in a civilization,‭ ‬this must not be the way.\n‎\t‏In order to create this ideal society,‭ ‬Taylor believed that a government must be made that accounts for the inherent good and evil inside of man.  Taylor was very rigid in his opinions on a dualistic morality.  He claimed that‭ “‬As government is exercised by man,‭ ‬all its virtues and vices must be human‭” (‬Ibid.,‭ ‬pg. 167‭)‬.  He defined good principles as those that protect private property,‭ ‬improve agriculture,‭ ‬and discourage capitalism,‭ ‬and believed that a government founded in good principles would function equitably regardless of its administration,‭ ‬which would inevitably be led by avarice and self-interest.  Self-interest,‭ ‬he believed,‭ ‬was man's motivation in all things,‭ ‬but that the trait was only considered evil when it led beyond the creation of a society based on the public good to sub-societies that lived at the expense of others.  A good government was necessary to retain man's natural evil,‭ ‬and even then it must be under careful observation to avoid the addition of bad principles.\n‎\t‏Taylor,‭ ‬like many other staunch Republicans of his time,‭ ‬called for a strict construction of the Constitution.  He wanted an extremely limited Federal government,‭ ‬with no more rights or powers allowed to it than were explicitly stated in the Constitution.  He knew that an extensive Federal government was expensive,‭ ‬and therefore likely to be despotic.  However,‭ ‬he believed that a simple,‭ ‬literal interpretation was dangerous,‭ ‬and that without reference to the intent of the writers,‭ ‬such a method could easily become corrupt.  Even more,‭ ‬he considered the Declaration of Independence the true charter of the United States,‭ ‬because it more explicitly describes the country as a group of sovereign states rather than one nation.",
            "\nReferring back to Figure 17, there was a precipitous drop in commuter log submissions in the third month of the project. That was a bit disheartening, and it is hard to say why that might have happened. With the onset of winter at a New England campus, there is clearly a drop in people commuting either by bicycle or by foot, which may account for some portion of the decline. December also marks the end of the fall semester when everyone is very busy finishing schoolwork, processing grades, and so forth. Filling out the commuter log might just have slipped off the radar screen for many folks. In addition, December brings the onset of the busy holiday season and the resulting month-long break for students and faculty, during which time many do not even need to come to campus at all. Classes then resume for the spring semester in late January, perhaps also a clue to the low number of logs for that month. But none of that really explains the low number of submissions for February. One might also conjecture that any project of this type is going to have an initial burst of energy and excitement at the outset, which might then naturally decline. In an effort to combat this trend, we created the Carpool Challenge Week, a special blitz campaign in March to try and reinvigorate the initiative, which did result in an increase in log submissions for that month. Thus, one of the challenges we experienced was how to maintain project momentum in the face of both a natural decrease in engagement, but also specifically the problem of holiday and semester breaks experienced in higher education. \nAnother challenge for this project (or any alternative commuting project) is the simple fact that people enjoy the freedom, independence, and flexibility of driving their cars. This is deeply embedded in our culture. Therefore, it is essential to provide incentives for engaging in alternative modes of commuting. We gave out a lot prizes in the form of gift certificates to local restaurants, coffee shops, massage therapists, the local independent bookstore, and even some larger national chain stores. It would have been interesting to see, however, how some even larger prizes might have affected participation – such as giving away a nice bicycle, hybrid car, or electric car. This could have also helped to combat that dip in engagement the project experienced. The nature of the prizes didn’t really change during the course of the project. If the prizes, however, were to increase in value over the course of the project, that might have helped. The gift cards seemed to be more than adequate at the outset of the project, but if we had announced in December the addition of a couple of bicycles, and then in January the addition of a hybrid or electric car, one can only think that participating and engagement would have increased instead of decreasing.

            "\n\n\tAn ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a security that is designed to track an index, a commodity or a basket of assets like an index fund, but is more flexible and trades like a stock on an exchange.  An ETF gives you the diversification of an index fund and the benefits of single stock ownership like the ability to sell short, buy on margin and purchase as few as a one share in any transaction.  Though these benefits are extremely attractive, the expense ratios of ETFs are far lower than those of the average mutual fund.  Unfortunately, there are some down sides, such as the need to pay a commission on any trade involving ETFs, just as you would pay on a stock order.  Another benefit of ETFs is the wide variety of funds available.  Though these benefits are clearly stated, it is always a good exercise for the savvy financial investor to evaluate whether stated benefits, like diversification, do indeed exist, and the extent to which they exist.  For the purposes of this effort, we will be examining the ETF IHF and comparing it against the top 10 holdings that comprise the ETF to determine whether the benefits of a owning a single ETF come close to the benefits of owning a diversified portfolio of the ten stocks and also whether or not there are better configurations of the same stocks that would provide a more optimal sharp ratio or return.\n\tIn order to evaluate the ETF, it would become rather unwieldy to include every holding, therefore we have decided to include only the top ten holdings accounting for 63.58% of all the assets in the ETF.  Below are the top 10 holdings and the percentage of total assets.\n\n\tIn order to gain an estimation of how well these ten stocks represent the ETF IHF as a whole, we can use the current % of assets, normalized to 100%, to  calculate the contributions of each stock to a portfolioâ€™s Beta and Return if the portfolio was made up entirely of these 10 stocks in the proportion that the ETF has established through their holdings.  The calculations of Beta and return are included in the below chart.\n\nFrom the above chart it is evident that the return of a portfolio containing only the top 10 holdings is 6.11% higher than the ETF, a 16% increase in returns.  It is also evident that the Beta of the top ten holdings is .12 lower than the ETF as a whole.  From the results completed thus far, it seems that a portfolio of just the top 10 holdings could provide a higher return with a lower beta.  However, there is a possibility that the means of these two portfolios may not be statistically different from each other.\n\tIn order to evaluate whether or not these portfolios are statistically different, the standard deviation of each of the top 10 stocks is determined and normalized to 100% in order to compare their accumulated standard deviation to that of the ETF IHF.

            "\n\tDream-land is one of Edgar Allan Poe’s self-proclaimed better poems. In “Dream-Land” Poe uses the term “Thulé” in lines 6 and 56 which Mabbott traces back to Virgil. Virgil used the term in reference to an island north of Britain which the Greeks considered the edge of the known world. It is certain that Virgil did use the term however there is a more current source to which some credit must be given. Poe was very interested in German authors. \nThis quote is important because it shows Poe’s familiarity with Gothe’s writing. Karl J. Arndt, in his book Poe’s Politian and Goethe’s Mignon, comments on the similarity of their two poems drawing the conclusion that Poe was imitating Goethe. \n\tOxford Companion to English Literature says of Gothe was a celebrated writer of the poetic drama Faust which was published in two parts the first in 1808 and the second in the year of Gothe’s death 1832. Within the poetic verse of Faust’s second part lies a short poem titled “The King of Thulé”.  The poem is about a king whose wife dies after she gives him the gift of a goblet. After his wife passes he begins drinking heavily and crying from the memory of his dead queen. He then decides it is his time to die and gives his possessions to his children save for the goblet. He then walks to a cliff, throws the goblet into the ocean, closes his eyes, and dies. The demeanor of the King of Thule and the description of the king in Dream-Land are very similar, maybe a dark doppelganger of Poe’s loss and crutch of drinking. Faust was also composed into a romantic drama by H P Grattan in 1842, which was less than one year prior to Poe’s use of the term Thule in “The Pit and the Pendulum”. \n\tPoe references Thule twice in his collected writings. Once Poe references “ultma Thule” in The Pit and the Pendulum but he uses this phrase in “Dream-Land” twice, as book ends for the poem. “The King of Thule” and “Dream-Land” can be read as companion pieces. In “Dream-Land” the speaker says. He then describes the landscape of Thule and how it is dark, lonely, he is haunted by dead friends, and he sees a shaded world without color. All of these scenes would be read into “The King of Thule” by Gothe as he has just lost his wife, he is lonely, and he has lost his will to rule or even live. The entire poem is a description as though the speaker has stepped into Goethe’s poem. \n\tGothe was a significant author who Poe would have known if for no other reason then his respect for Tennyson. Poe had this to say when asked if he admired Tennyson. Aside from the connection to Tennyson Poe would have been exposed to Gothe’s work in the many reproductions that were taking place after the original publication. ",
            "\n\n\n\tUnder California law, could a customer that was injured after slipping and falling on an applesauce spill in a grocery store be awarded punitive damages by showing the store manager acted with malice because he was informed twice of the spill and failed to have it cleaned for a half-hour because he was eating dinner?\n\tA judge is not likely to summarily dismiss Jennifer Palmer’s punitive damage claim. To state a claim that an award of punitive damages is justified a plaintiff must present evidence that the defendant’s actions were committed with a willful and conscious disregard for the probable harm that would result from the conduct, as well as showing that the conduct was despicable. Palmer will be able to argue that Martin should have known the probable harm of not cleaning a spill because multiple D&D customers were injured from slipping in the months prior to Palmer’s accident; and despite this knowledge he still failed to have the spill cleaned. Palmer’s argument that Martin’s actions were despicable are less persuasive, but are still reasonable given the facts that six slip-and-fall incidents had occurred in 2009 and Martin still failed to take appropriate actions to maintain the safety of his store \n\tOn October 13, 2009 at 5:00 pm, Rich Wayne an employee of D&D Markets informed his manager, Paul Martin that there was an applesauce spill in an aisle. Martin told Wayne that he was on dinner break and “didn’t have time to deal with customer complaints.” At 5: 15 pm, another employee, Mary J. Haddigan also notified Mr. Martin of the spill, and Martin responded the same way.  At 5:30 pm on the thirteenth, the plaintiff, Jennifer Palmer slipped and fell on the spill and sustained a serious back injury. Prior to Palmer’s accident five different slip-and-fall incidents had been reported at D&D’s in the year 2009. Palmer is now suing D&D for compensatory and punitive damages related to her injury, and we are examining whether to file a motion for partial summary against the punitive damage claim. \n\tIn California, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages for a breach of an obligation not arising out of a contract if the defendant acted with “oppression, fraud or malice.” Cal. Civ. Code, § 3294(a) (Lexis 2010). The statute defines malice as conduct that intended to cause harm, or absent intent, the conduct must be “despicable” and committed with “a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” id. at § (c)(1). Courts have characterized conduct as malicious when committed with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights when the defendant “was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct, and that he willfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” Taylor v.

            "\n\tAlmost four years ago I took a course in Islam at CBC.  One of the main topics of heated discussion in the class was whether or not Islam is a hostile religion.  I believe that the question is even more relevant today than ever before.  Looking back on the events since 9/11 I have personally observed mass media go from a hostile view of Islam and extremists to an extreme from of tolerance for Islam in America.  I don’t think in 2001 we could have ever had a presidential candidate with the name Borac Obama, who has an obvious Muslim background in his family.\n\tThe Biography of the Prophet is intriguing to me because according to what I know of the history of Muhammad, the biography contradicts the personality of Muhammad.  From what I know and learned in the past, I thought that Muhammad forced converts to Islam.  He would conquer and take over tribes and then force them to take on the Islam religion.  But according to the biography, Muhammad was written as a sort of Martyr, who was misunderstood and even humbled himself to others.  After which one by one people came to see the ‘truth’ in his teaching and sought him out.\n\tAlso, there are some uncanny similarities between the ministries of Jesus and the ‘miracles’ of Muhammad.  The most obvious is when he took mutton and milk and multiplied it so that there was more than enough for forty men.  It is this style of writing that makes me believe the writers wanted Muhammad to be perceived as the humble prophet, who needed not to prove anything, but simply lived in truth and miracles.  This sort of fallacy is the worst because it downplays the miracle and life of Jesus Christ.  To me, it is like they are stealing and trying to take credit for the life and personhood of Jesus through Muhammad.  \n\tThere are also a lot of stories in the biography that make it seem like part of their agenda is to provide proof of ‘witness’ or of how people ‘on their own’ converted to Islam.  But the problem is that a lot of the stories are at least from a third party perspective.  That is in the story the author illustrates that he heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so etc.  I didn’t like this much because although their idea was that it provided proof of the truth of the stories, I thought it diminished the stories and made it seem all that more suspicious.\n\tI think the thing that bothers me most about this work is that they try and exalt and lift up Muhammad as a godly man who was humble, endearing, wise, and gentle.  But history contradicts the idea that Muhammad was a gentle and humble man, and I can’t help but think if Muslims today know the true history behind Muhammad’s rise to power. ",
            "\n       The teachings of Jesus and the beliefs he held during his lifetime were immediately left behind in the development of Christian thought that moved forward after his life.  If we look at this history in broad strokes, we see a trend of Christianity straying farther and farther from its origin.  It seems that today’s world shows an ever-growing awareness and an unprecedented progressive tendency.  While traditional people remain and will resist any kind of thinking beyond what was taught to them, this portion of the population may not be prominent enough to influence the whole.  Among Christians, a historical awareness will grow immensely in future years.  A yearning will spread, to distinguish the doctrines that were added into Christianity over time from the actual intent of the religion’s namesake.  It may take decades or even centuries, but the outcome will be inevitable:  There will be a great reversal in the trend of Christian history.  There will be a progression back to its original form.  A movement will grow in numbers that will remove layers of doctrine, one after the other, just as if the clock started moving backward, until nothing is left except a conception of what Jesus introduced to humanity on behalf of God, before any other thinkers made such claims.  When this trend sweeps through the United States and Europe, influencing masses in its wake to worship as if we were living at the time of Jesus, following only his ideas, the church as an institution will remain strong to lead the way.  However, because the theological clock will have moved backward, the extreme proliferation of diversity in Christendom will reverse into more and more uniformity of belief and practice.  Between regions, between denominations, between divisions of every kind, we will see instead of differences, increasing similarities.  Human history is filled with great reversions.  Just one example is how Christians were at one time persecuted, shunned and killed by the Roman Empire.  But later that empire became a Christian institution.  Our country has gone from African-American slavery to African-American leadership.  The great reversion coming in our future will play itself out in the arena of the Christian religion, undoing history in search of the source, and undoing diversity in the process.  It is crucial to note that part of what will make this process possible will be a method of reading Jesus’ words as metaphorical, and not as literal statements.  So what is it that happened since Jesus’ lifetime?\n       If we look far enough back into history, we find only Judaism, the theological beginning for the Christian religion.  Monotheism, the perception of a divinely revealed religion, and the authority of the Hebrew scriptures, were all at the core of the religion by the time the Romans assumed control of Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E.  The Jewish population did not share one spirit.  They divided into Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots and a majority of common people. ",
            "\n\tI believe that The Jungle shows how human beings deep down inside are naturally greedy and self-centered. They only want to look out for themselves and make their lives as good as possible, but never look out for anyone lower then themselves. The Jungle shows this in many ways. The main obvious area is the owners and managers of the great factories.  All they want to do is make their companies and factories as big and great as they can be. They do not care about anyone or anything that gets in their way or anything that gets hurt because of their advancements. According to Upton Sinclair's work, \"The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world\". Sinclair is trying to paint a picture of the great damage that this pollution is creating. He shows that the owners have no regard for any person or animal that might get hurt. They do not care about the great plumes of smoke billowing out of the factories or the animal feces and urine runoff from the thousands of pens around Packingtown. \nThe owners and managers also did not care about their employees working to make them rich. They would do anything to make or save an extra buck, \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar\". They force their employees to work awful hours and then without even a day's notice they might layoff multitudes of people at a time without any compensation or help finding a job. During the era The Jungle is set in there were not many, if any, laws or regulations protecting the workers safety or well being. This allowed the managers and owners to run wild, forcing their employees to speed up progress and work in terrible conditions. Although the book never says it directly, the people who lived and worked themselves to death in Packingtown were simply expected to deal with the horrible conditions both while working in the factories and living around them. There were no agencies or organizations set up to provide information or help to the workingman. There were unions that were formed, but these often did more harm than help as they made money off of the poor workers. The workers were so badly treated and had no way of escaping the system of Packingtown that they were described as slaves, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "\nMany authors use different ways to give their readers a certain feeling or attitude toward\nimportant subjects. Some of these techniques are more effective than others. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses\nmany of these different techniques in his novel The Great Gatsby. Sometimes, Fitzgerald pairs an\nadjective and a noun together that do not usually fit that way to give readers a certain aura around a\nsubject. Other times, he applies meaning to a symbol, and then uses it for this same purpose.\nFitzgerald uses this last technique with many colors, including gold, green, white/gray and red/pink. In\nhis novel The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald builds up meaning for colors, namely white/gray and\nred/pink then later uses that meaning to give readers a certain reminder of a feeling around an\nimportant object.\nThe meaning Fitzgerald builds up and uses for white/gray is uniformity, with white being a bit\nnicer and higher class and gray being more older and faded. Fitzgerald sets up this meaning in the\nbeginning of the novel with constant uses of both. Daisy and Jordan are constantly “in white” (8)—in\nfact, everyone is always wearing white: Nick wears “white flannels” (41) to Gatsby’s party, Tom wears\na “white shirt” (36) when he meets Myrtle, and Catherine is “powdered milky white” (30). In fact, the\nonly time people are not wearing white is when Nick is getting his impressions of Gatsby’s party: “the\nhalls... are gaudy with primary colors” (40). Fitzgerald further defines these two colors in coloring\nmany common, unimportant subjects these colors: as Nick goes to work, he goes “down the white\nchasms of lower New York” (56), the names of people at Gatsby’s parties are now “gray names” (61)\non Nick’s timetable, Catherine’s apartment is “one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses”—\nuniformity (28). He also describes plain or common people or places as white or gray: Jordan and\nDaisy had a “white girlhood” (19) together, there are “gray cars” and “gray land” (23) in the valley of\nashes, the “Italian child” in the railroad is “gray” (26), and the dog-seller is “a gray old man” (27).\nAfter Fitzgerald adds enough meaning to white/gray, he uses them to signify unimportance or\nuniformity to certain subjects. This using colors to show readers something first starts with Daisy.\nAfter a long time without any significant use of either of these colors, Fitzgerald comes out describing\nDaisy as “dressed in white” in “a little white roadster”; readers begin to see Daisy as less of a character,\nmore like just a uniform addition, something that Gatsby wants and longs for (74). Fitzgerald uses\nmore of this technique around Daisy to give this impression of Daisy being a more uniform addition,\nfor example, there is a “gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar” (18), and she is again in a “white” (115) dress\nbefore Tom and Gatsby’s encounter.

            "\n\tSan Diego County is very agriculturally productive, thanks to a mild, sunny climate. Common crops include: tomatoes, citrus, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. There is a substantial market for organic community supported agriculture food in the San Diego area, with many local organizations having lengthy waiting lists. Organic eggs and milk are also popular. Many organic farms also provide tours of their agricultural operations as well as access for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational activities. This is the type of operation that would allow the landowner to gain the benefits of government programs while improving habitat, thus allowing recreational use and creating an opportunity for farm tours and other programs for making money or for educational purposes.  \n\tIn addition to filling a potentially lucrative niche market, the benefits of organic farming often include greater biodiversity in plants and wildlife in the area thanks to a lack of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming has greater costs than conventional farming in some ways. It requires more intensive labor and management to remove pests and weeds and fertilize the soil without chemicals, and losses are often greater than with conventional methods, while a small organic farm also lacks the efficiency of scale of large operations. Practices not related to organic farming but beneficial to wildlife may also incur greater labor costs, including planting cover crops, strategic grazing rotation, invasive species removal, and active management of plant growth to provide specific conditions such as edge habitat or patches of open ground. Thus, there are many reasons why the landowner in this example might seek financial help or expertise in maximizing both profits and habitat quality.  \nThe land chosen for this scenario is a parcel adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It is 160 acres of chaparral, nonnative Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland next to to the Cleveland National Forest. It lies in the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion of the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan. The plan is still being reviewed, but presently considers over a hundred species of plants and animals. Many are endangered, such as the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several species of butterfly, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may soon be listed, such as burrowing owls.\n\tThis area was inhabited by Native Americans for untold centuries and was then settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800's. This piece of land was part of an original homestead patent and so was probably used for grazing and/or wood production for many of the intervening decades.\n\t chose a piece of property from a real estate website and researched available government programs to see what options a small farmer might realistically have for mitigating costs and preserving wildlife-friendly operations.  As a model of what somebody farming this land might attempt to achieve, I located an organic farm in the same area. ",
            "\nCulture plays a significant role in any negotiation. Culture can be defined as much by what it is not as what it actually is and what it signifies. Culture is not homogenous, nor is it a specific thing. It is also not singular or uniform. Statements such as “all Russians are stubborn” or “all Japanese are accommodating,” are inherently broad and overly simplistic. While the understanding of a culture’s generalizations are appropriate, it is much more productive to a negotiator to understand the significance of a culture to the matter at hand, and how that culture’s attitude can and will affect the table talks. When one approaches a foreign culture, one experiences it in a way that is relatable to his own culture, and comparisons necessarily arise. \n\nAttempting to understand a foreign culture or mindset can involve anything from studying its history to realizing its prejudices. Rather than judging or attempting to change a culture, one must simply accept it for what it is, and work within its boundaries, especially within the scope of negotiation, and most especially if one comes to the table with a weaker bargaining position. Likewise, if a negotiator finds himself on “away” territory, a respect for traditions and beliefs can only help in getting over any cultural barriers and move the negotiation forward.\n\nIt is important to note that culture does not necessarily limit itself to a national/international dichotomy. Most companies within a given nation establish their own corporate culture. For instance, a corporate culture might emphasize long hours in the office or a more relaxed schedule. Evidence of a corporate culture can be seen in employee dress codes, in communication style (direct v. indirect communication, delegation of duties), and hiring practices. Some companies encourage philanthropy at any level from employees, others restrict it to “company approved” charities or fundraisers. One need only look at the differences in American corporate culture from company to company (and indeed, intra-company diversity exists even from region to region, urban to suburban environments included) to appreciate the diversity of thought that can reside within a particular societal culture. Certain cultures are not nearly as stratified as American culture, and may appear more uniform to an outsider, but a similar exterior is simply a sign to dig deeper. \n\nValues are even more important to understand, because they provide the why of a culture. If saving face or communal harmony are valued within a culture, it is certain that a negotiator will not publicly shame his company or his superior in order to succeed at the negotiation table. Likewise, a negotiator from a culture which gives greater weight to a hard-driven bargain will not necessarily be driven to settle at the earliest opportunity. Taking these generalities into consideration is important before one gets to the negotiating table. However, a negotiator is well-served to learn something about his opponent on a personal level in order to make the negotiation effective. ",
            "\n\t“The fool hath said in his heart, ‘There is no God.’” The preceding quotation is seen first in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible, and is found at the beginning of St. Anselm’s argument regarding the existence of God. This belief seems to also be held by the other author whom we will be discussing, Thomas Aquinas. Because each of their arguments is in defense of the same concept, and our challenge is to determine who’s is the better of the two, we must, for sake of brevity, begin with the presumption that they are both correct in their belief in the existence of God, specifically the God of the Bible. To allow for a God-type figure that may not resemble the one in whom our two authors believe would not permit us to appropriately compare their two arguments, as they are essentially in defense of one specific concept of God. That being said, I would suggest that while each of them brings up valid points, neither truly provides a holistic basis for belief in God.\n\tTo illustrate this point, we will first examine the basic argument of St. Anselm. Anselm’s passage reflects a path of gaining understanding through faith, looking within one’s self to find proof of God. He explains that because God exists within our understanding, we cannot effectively conceive his nonexistence. While this concept, when spelled out in his terminology, is a bit tedious and at times unclear, the basic gist of it is that the proof for God lies within one’s own mind. St. Anselm is suggesting to us that we needn’t go beyond the confines of our own soul to find truth about God, but that the existence of this being is found to be true simply by examining that which we inherently know to be true within our own minds. Foreign evidence is presumably unnecessary. This concept of accepting that for which there is not an irrefutable body of empirical evidence is often referred to within Christian texts as faith.\n\tThis idea is very different from that held by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas instead suggests that the existence of God can be proven entirely through reason and empirical evidence, with no need for faith of any kind. Such an idea would be beneficial in evangelism, an important element of Christianity, because it would enable the recruiting of new converts without any dependency upon their willingness to accept something that cannot be proven. They could instead be persuaded by logic alone. St. Thomas elaborates on five different logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. In each he essentially demonstrates that the proof of God lies in the logical necessity for God. If you are told that that you are missing one puzzle piece, and assemble the rest of the puzzle, logic dictates that you can know of the features and the existence of the missing piece without having to see it.\n",
            "\n\n\tSometime in the fifth or sixth century BCE, a prince who would one day be called Buddha was born. Over the course of his life, he renounced the world and became enlightened, and his teachings led to the formation of Buddhism—the most orthodox sect of which is known as Theravada Buddhism. The religion is around twenty five hundred years old; it looks different today than it did when Buddha was alive. This can be seen all over, for instance in the Theravada nation of Sri Lanka, where the annual water-cutting ceremony is observed. Monks and laymen alike participate in this ceremony, and it holds some religious significance, despite Buddha never teaching about any festivity of the sort. These differences run all the way from the superficial traditions to the soteriological core of the religion. The Theravada Buddhist community, both from the monastic perspective and from the lay perspective, has had to change its doctrinal principles over time. This can be attributed to forces both external and internal, both hostile and benign.\n\tThere are a number of qualifying terms this discussion will make frequent use of. There is the concept of internal versus external. Here, an internal force is defined as a force borne of members of the Buddhasasana, regardless of monastic status. An external force is any force from non-Buddhists. A hostile force is any force that damages or intends to damage the Buddhist community—a force borne of a negative perception of Buddhism. A benign force is a force that does not wish to harm or help the Buddhist community—though it may end up doing one or the other as a byproduct. These terms will come up repeatedly throughout this discussion.\n\tFirst, it is important to investigate the basics of the religion—the doctrines that lie at the core of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the triple gem of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. The Dhamma is essentially comprised of the Tripitaka—the three baskets—of Buddhist text. The Sutta Pitaka contains all the Suttas, the Vinaya Pitaka contains the disciplinary rules, and the Abhidhamma Pitaka contains the metaphysical components of Buddhism. The metaphysical notions consist of things like Anatta—no soul, Dukkha—inherent suffering in life, and Anicca—impermanence of everything. Only by recognizing these concepts can one end Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, which happens continuously. Along with Sansara will end lobha—desire, dosa—hatred, and moha—delusion, when one becomes enlightened. In the Vinaya Pitaka, rules for life are set forth. For laymen, there are five precepts (I shall not kill, I shall not lie, I shall not steal, I shall not misbehave sexually, and I shall not take intoxicating substances). For monks, there are many more disciplinary rules to be followed. The most fundamental doctrinal notion in Buddhism is the notion of the four noble truths. First, Dukkha; the truth that life is suffering. Second, that attachment causes suffering. Third, that suffering can be overcome. ",
            "\n\tThe United States of America and Mexico are an example of two nations which at one time were beset by an enduring rivalry which spanned 57 years, from 1836 to 1893. (Diehl and Goerts 2000 p. 145).  The high-water mark of this rivalry was the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, where the United States attacked and defeated Mexico and secured for itself Texas and the American Southwest as new territory.  Many other clashes happened between the two nations, finally abating just before the First World War.   The rivalry began as Americans and Mexicans clashed on key issues such as religion, culture and tradition and had a major clash of material interests (Schmitt 1974 p. 30-31).   \n\tThis is not unlike many other nations who have an enduring rivalry with a neighbor.  Nations which share a border tend to have clashes of interests which lend to the creation of rival positions between the nations.  The United States and Mexico are not unlike many other enduring rivalries between nations which share a common border.  David M. Pletcher (1977) states that “Only in Mexico and Cuba can one find long-lasting overarching American diplomatic problems” (p. 41).  Indeed, both of these nations are geographically close to the United States and have been rivals to the United States, while other nations in Latin America enjoy and have enjoyed good relations with the United States.   \n\tReligious issues created a rift between the two nations, a problem which has beset many nations through history.  Sally Frahm (2001) states that ”if in the twentieth century Americans were opposed to fascism and communism, in the eighteenth and nineteenth they were opposed to Catholicism and monarchy”  (p.86).  Not unlike the Cold War’s rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union was part ideological struggle and part a competition over interests each nation deemed vital. In this case, however, the ideological struggles weren’t based on the political structure but on instead the religious preferences of the United States and Mexico.  This distrust grew from the distrust between the English and Spanish.  Inheriting these feelings of distrust from their former colonial rulers was a major obstacle in the establishment of amiable foreign relations between the United States and Mexico.\n\tDiehl and Goerts (2000) list 17 disputes between Mexico and the United States in the 57-year rivalry period.   The majority of disputes between the rivalry period described by Diehl and Goerts are territorial issues relating to border raids from Mexican territory into Mexico and other frontier problems.  Border raids by bandits and outlaws from on American border towns were a major problem which remained until both the United States and Mexico exerted military force on their borders (Schmitt 1974 p. 97).  \nSchmitt (1974) explains the rivalry between the two nation began to abate as “Mexico became clearly dependent on the United States in a substantial way” (p. 109) and finally ended as American ambitions “changed from territorial expansion to economic intervention into Mexico” (p.110) in the later part of the 19th Century. \n",
            "\nFifteen‭ ‬years ago I became suddenly and unexpectedly disabled by an illness I never knew existed. \n\n I was a nurse at the time. I had chosen my profession out of a deeply entrenched need for the safety and security I didn't have as a child. ‭\"‬You'll always be able to find work‭; ‬people will always get sick.‭\" ‬was the mantra I heard over and over as I reached adolescence and beyond. So--‭ ‬even though my dream was to be a scientist or a journalist-preferably a little of both,‭ ‬I chose nursing. \n\nNevertheless,‭ ‬there I was:‭ ‬46‭ ‬years old and single,‭ ‬no money in the bank to speak of and unable to work. To this day I am disabled,‭ ‬and after‭ ‬15‭ ‬years of living on Social Security Disability,‭ ‬I have literally nothing left that I can call‭ \"‬mine.‭\" ‬I get by,‭ ‬but every day is a struggle and an assault on my security,‭ ‬safety and self-esteem. Nothing in my life is certain anymore,‭ ‬yet,‭ ‬there is one thing that I know to be true. I could not have gotten by for all these years were it not for the help of my family and a few good friends,‭ ‬no matter how strong I was. And believe me,‭ ‬when real disaster strikes,‭ ‬you do not feel very strong at all. \n\nMy point is that there will always be emergencies in life-big and small.  There are no guarantees and no matter how well one prepares,‭ ‬some things are just too big to overcome on your own. \n\nI agree wholeheartedly that we in the U.S. need to stop putting all of our eggs in big government's‭ \"‬basket‭\"; ‬Lord knows it is moldy‭ ‬and falling apart,‭ ‬anyway. Yet I would much rather see Americans learning to trust one another again‭–‬learning to help each other and to ask for help,‭ ‬rather‭ ‬than have each of us individually clambering out to the backyard to build fallout shelters. \n\nThe Conservatives in the US talk about the‭ \"‬rugged individualism‭\" ‬that built this country‭; ‬but in truth,‭ ‬what kept our forefathers going in hard times wasn't rugged individualism,‭ ‬it was compassion,‭ ‬mutual respect and the sharing of resources. The pioneers who crossed the Rockies in wagon trains didn't make it to the coast by going it alone. \n\n\nSo,‭ ‬by all means,‭ ‬be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit‭; ‬first‭ ‬aid supplies,‭ ‬water purifying tablets and plastic sheeting and duct tape for the windows in the event of a biological attack. I have several flashlights and all sorts of batteries,‭ ‬lots and lots of candles and waterproof matches and canned goods,‭ ‬too. If‭ ‬you have the land and the resources for a small farm and the ability to can or preserve your own food-do it. It's a great idea,‭ ‬as is a wood stove,‭ ‬as long as you do not live in an apartment. \n\nBut while you are at it,‭ ‬get to know your neighbors.",
            "Why do organisms evolve in the manner that they do‭? ‬Are there restrictions or constraints that influence the direction of evolutionary change‭? ‬Although in‭ ‬1917‭ ‬D’Arcy Thompson stated that‭ “‬Even now the zoologist has scarce begun to dream of defining in mathematical language even the simplest organic forms‭” ‬the same can be said today. More recently,‭ ‬mathematical modeling has been applied to general aspects of mollusk skeletogenesis through both ontogeny and phylogeny‭ (‬e.g.,‭ ‬Raup and Stanley,‭ ‬1981‭)‬. Our study is exploring how mathematical modeling of ontogenetic and phylogenetic change in Prunum,‭ ‬in combination with experimental studies,‭ ‬can be used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change. We used X-radiographic images of Prunum species to delineate quantitative parameters that could in turn be used to model hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were entered into the software program CerioShell‭ (‬Stone,‭ ‬1995‭)‬. We modeled hypothetical shell morphologies that could be used to interpret the boundaries of possible morphological change in Prunum. These results are being combined with experimental and descriptive studies in order to better understand macroevolutionary events in this clade.\n\nA shell can be thought of as a structure that is a tube that travels over time through‭ ‬360‭ ‬degrees of space.  These revolutions or turns of a coiled shell are called whorls,‭ ‬which are considered to spiral around an imaginary central axis.  This axis runs through the central column of the shell and is known as the columella. The speed at which the whorls enlarge can vary,‭ ‬and a continuous line separates each whorl and is referred to as a suture.  In most shells,‭ ‬the largest whorl of a shell is the last whorl‭ (‬body whorl‭)‬.  ‭ ‬The spire is considered to be all the whorls except the last. The apex is the tip of the spire and the opposite end is referred to as the base. The animal extends out of its shell through an opening called the aperture.\n\nShells can be viewed in apical,‭ ‬basal,‭ ‬apertural and abapertural views. ‭(‬The‭ \"‬usual‭\" ‬orientation of a shell is an apertural view,‭ ‬with the aperture toward the viewer and with the apex pointing up.‭)‬\n\nA method for counting whorls is seen below.  First,‭ ‬the shell should be viewed from the apical view and then it should be determined where the first suture begins.  A line can be then drawn dividing the shell into two parts.  Whorls are counted from this line,‭ ‬and are estimated to a quarter of a whorl.\n\nA shell can be viewed as a series of apertures that travel through time and space as the animal accretes‭ (‬i.e. builds‭) ‬its shell.  It is possible to trace the path of the aperture via coordinates of the center of each whorl’s aperture as well as the horizontal and vertical radius of the aperture.\n\nThis trajectory can be graphically and mathematically represented.  Once a mathematical formulation is made,‭ ‬it is then possible to vary parameters and modify the mollusk’s skeletogenesis.\n",
            "\n\tThe rate of neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia remained rather static for the last ten years.  While the country is on track to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, such as the water and sanitation targets, the rates of improvement for child and maternal health are woefully short of the improvements needed to meet their target goals by 2015.  The multiple reasons for these shortcomings will be discussed below, and point to a need to strengthen the health system rather than focus on programmatic interventions.\n\tIndonesia has made improvements in the number of births with a skilled health worker attending, with 72% of births now meeting this target.  That being said, this category still includes traditional workers, such as midwives, who cannot provide medical interventions should the pregnancy be complicated (hence the large percentage of maternal deaths caused by hemorrhage).  In other words,  the improvements made in this particular indicator are somewhat misleading and there is still much work to be done.  In addition, there has been a decline in the percentage of diarrheal cases in children under five years treated by a health professional.  While data on postnatal care is incomplete, it is clear that this area is also of concern, with low rates across the country.\n\tCesarian-section rates are still lower than should be expected, around 4%.  The c-section rates additionally point to another concerning issue.  While the rate of c-section is 7% in urban settings, it is only 2% in rural.  This points to the problem of equity of coverage across the country.  Clearly access to healthcare services is focused around urban areas.  Another issue of access concerns vertical equity.  There is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and richest quintiles.  Clearly the poor are finding it much more difficult to access healthcare services, likely due to out of pocket costs.\n\tIn discussing next steps towards improving neonatal and maternal care indicators, the most basic question is how to most effectively address the lack of service.  Specifically, should Indonesia develop program-specific approaches or strengthen the overall health system without focusing on pre and post-pregnancy care for the mother and child.  There is no question that programmatic approaches to solve the problems outlined above are attractive.  Not only do “vertical approaches” that target one sector of improvements have much more targeted, manageable objectives, they also generally generate faster results.  There are some drawbacks to keep in mind, however.  One major drawback is that investing heavily in programming for one particular area of the health sector often means that funding for other areas suffers and human resources will flock towards working in that area that has more resources (the effect of international funding to HIV/AIDS and its effect on the family planning sector is one example).  In addition, running multiple parallel programs for one area results in duplication of services that are also uncoordinated between programs.  This leads to an increase in forms and paperwork for supplies and funding. ",
            "\n\tVictorian novels are characterized by their overwhelming attention to detail and their focus on the aristocracy of the period.  Two novels that are considered Victorian but stray away form this tradition are Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights.  Both novels employ an element of mystery and a flare for the bizarre, atypical of the novels from the period, which strengthens the characters within each work; providing insight that elaborates on their motives and emotions.  \n\n“And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing: for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” \n(Dickens, 220)\n\n\n\tThe two novels utilize this mystery often through dream sequences or dreamlike states, though the content and function varies in each specific case. In Oliver Twist these strange happenings often reveal some insight concerning Oliver’s inner layers, what pains him, and his awareness about the true nature of the things happening around him. When the shooting of Oliver is finally revisited in chapter 28, Oliver relives the shooting vividly, as if in a dream, while he struggles to find help (see left). The passage stresses the lack of control that Oliver had over the events that unfolded, as well as the dire straights his health had come to occupy, which was strongly present via Oliver’s hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting itself overwhelms him, all his senses are numbed as he does not notice the “unseen hand” that bears him away; he experiences his despair over again removed from the shock of pain, as the pain is now constant and is linked with fear rather than surprise. With Oliver being overwhelmed the question arises about whose will brought about his misfortune, because it was certainly not his own. This shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little control over anything in that he can not bring himself to even attempt to gain control of an event’s outcome, even while his life is in danger. A growing sense of defeat in Oliver is also implied by this selection, as if old Fagin had begun to break him, forcing him into accepting this despair, influencing his ability to react. For otherwise it can be assumed that Oliver would have made some effort, at least simply for the sake of his own life.\n\n\n“The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours. ",
            "‎\t‏A couple years ago,‭ ‬I worked in an after school program tutoring Elementary age students. I did my best to help them in whatever subject they were struggling in,‭ ‬but my strengths were in English and reading. I was recruited by one of the instructors to help a little boy named Adrian‭ (‬I believe he was in third or fourth grade‭)‬,‭ ‬who was having a lot of trouble reading. It dawned on me,‭ ‬that something was wrong‭; ‬he was having the most peculiar problems. Some letters he understood how to pronounce perfectly,‭ ‬others,‭ ‬not even close,‭ ‬it was the strangest thing. You know,‭ ‬he was of Latino decent,‭ ‬that I was sure,‭ ‬but the boy spoke perfect English. We struggled from there,‭ ‬until the day I met his mother. I was helping to babysitting‭ (‬for lack of a better term‭) ‬a few straggles while the rest of the after school group was on a field trip when his mother walked in. His mother didn't speak a word of English,‭ ‬only Spanish. With my very bad knowledge of Spanish‭ (‬I was only just learning‭)‬,‭ ‬we managed to communicate. But it was then that it hit me like a sack of bricks:‭ ‬Adrian could read fine,‭ ‬he just didn't know the English alphabet very well. I don't know if that revelation ever helped him much,‭ ‬but I do hope that he's doing better now.\n‎\t‏I tell that story,‭ ‬to address the problem of the language barrier in schools,‭ ‬especially here in California. I also tell it to prove that it's not always as obvious as we'd think. Even for a child who speaks perfect English,‭ ‬reading it can still be a huge obstetrical. I think everyone can agree that this problem exists,‭ ‬so what do we do‭? ‬In Adrian's case,‭ ‬the solution was fairly simple:‭ ‬tutoring in English reading,‭ ‬particularly the alphabet and pronunciations. But for the many children who barely speak English,‭ ‬the solution is much more complex. There is no one answer. The dual language system,‭ ‬mainstream immersion,‭ ‬private tutors,‭ ‬ESL classes,‭ ‬not one of these things,‭ ‬by itself,‭ ‬will fix this problem. The key lies in combining all of the above‭!‬\n\tFirst of all,‎ ‏the dual language system is a great idea. Not just for children who's first language is Spanish,‭ ‬but for all children. ‭“‬Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically.‭” ‬A lot of fear surrounds this idea,‭ ‬that it's a waste of resources,‭ ‬and that the majority of children in schools will reap no benefit. But that's false. If we were to apply these sorts of programs in the classroom as the rule,‭ ‬rather than the exception,‭ ‬all children would benefit from it. How do we go about this though‭? ‬Do we require all teachers to be bilingual‭? ‬No. That would be unreasonable and slightly unrealistic. However,‭ ‬I do think that there is no reason we can't have special Aids,‭ ‬tutors,‭ ‬whatever you want to call them,‭ ‬who are bilingual.",
            "\n\n\tFrom the time we are children most of us are told that there is something out there that is bigger than we are, bigger than we can comprehend.  Some of us are sent to Sunday school to learn about it, while others go to Temple, or search within themselves for the answers.  Many of us readily accept the religions that have been passed down to us by our parents.  However, some of us reject them wholeheartedly, denying that there can be nothing beyond knowing in our own personal egocentric universe.  We may adopt one value structure only to later change our minds and value another in its place.  Whatever path we choose, we journey to define a part of ourselves through our own unique perspectives of spirituality.  We search for a light in the dark to lead us out of the shadows and into the sun.\n\n“A cardinal,” my father said when I asked him what his favorite type of bird was.  We sat on the front porch of our house, listening to the rain pound on the tin roof overhead while we smoked our cigarettes together. The gutters brought the rain down, drowning the plants along the edge of the porch.  He looked out into the rain, the sort of stare that seems half searching, half remembering.  He had grown thinner over the past few months, and his clothes hung listlessly from his body. His hair had lessened, sparser than I remembered it, too.  He stared out into the rain still, avoiding eye contact.  I felt alone, afraid, and unable to talk to my father about how much I would miss him because talking about it would only make it more real for both of us.  I hugged him, sat back down, moved my chair a little closer to his, and joined him in gazing out into the falling rain of the June twilight.\n\n\tMy father passed away in December that year, five days after my twenty-second birthday.  The chemo and radiation had not eased my father’s suffering, but kept him alive a few more months past the doctors’ projections; what the value was when he merely suffered longer I could not define.  What kind of God would do this, I thought to myself.  Alone in the night, I said no prayers.  If God existed, I thought, he had stopped listening to me long ago. \n\n \tI had not wanted to watch him pass from this life into another one.  So I had not.  I could not watch the life that created me while it ended.  I wanted to remember my father by how he lived and not how he died.  Besides, I knew my father better than they did, better than his family did, and knew Dad would not wish for his only child to be a spectator at his death.  I curled up in a ball in my bed for three days and waited for the news.\n\n\tNo one even called me. ",
            "\n\n\n\tThe traditional \"Gothic Novel\" is, in substance and in name an \"oxymoron for 'Old-New,'\" as Ian Watt describes it in The Rise of the Gothic Novel. The Gothic mode has been disparaged, praised, accused of having no real depth, and lauded for the 'terrible sublime' aspect it seemed to evoke (Burke).  The original \"Gothic Novel,\" Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, used the ideas of both \"the ancient and the modern\" romances to create the proto-Gothic genre, and to create a new method of literary expression. Walpole uses \"old\" theatrical elements and 'new' mimicry of nature in 'modern' novels to present what he terms \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). The Gothic genre uses many throwbacks to medieval gothic theatre, architecture, and traditions. Even at the time of the publication of The Castle of Otranto, the word \"gothic\" had been used to describe many different peoples, styles, and time periods. It was perceived as archaic or unsophisticated in the face of \"modern\" societal and literary \"advancements.\" The combination of the more theatrical \"Gothic\" and the new format of the novel (allowing the reader a more personal view of the psychology of the characters) is what allows Gothic to remain for such a long time, and become at once obsolete and new to a reader much displaced in time from the original writing.\n\tOne of the most prominent gothic ideas present in Gothic novels is the concept of Chivalry. The medieval idea of chivalry, the process of training a proper knight, is both retained and transmuted in the original Gothic novel, The Castle of Otranto. Chivalry is especially important to Gothic writers because of what it represented—the classic knight, brave, honorable, competent—and the supposed or perceived lack of that ideal those writers (particularly Walpole) saw in society. Through the use of the chivalric concepts and manners the  \"gothic past\" become idealized and romanticized (hinting at the future evolution of Gothic to Romantic) and is used to attempt to improve the present. Walpole was, when he wrote The Castle of Otranto, in the midst of a politically troubled time, and was despairing over the possible future. He, immersed in politics and (debatably) unfair accusations, may have began to think, even if not explicitly, that the supposed morality and innate \"goodness\" in people present in the gothic era had been somehow lost in those individuals that made up the 'present' society. In his writing this concept is clearly seen in several characters, one being the character Frederic. The reader can see before meeting Frederic that he embodies many chivalric traits, he is described as: \n\nThe description of him includes a great many traditionally chivalric images; Frederic is, foremost, a prince, he has suffered, been suitably affected by tragedy that he leaves, and is currently supposed to have been killed by infidels. The figure of the \"gallant and courteous Knight\" is, of course exaggerated, bringing the soon to be Gothic trope of excess into play (66). ",
            "\n\tSupply chain management is the stream of processes of moving goods from the customer order through the raw materials stage, supply, production, and distribution of products to the customer. The term supply chain management was invented in 1982 by Keith Oliver, a consultant. Keith Oliver described the overall process of planning, implementing, and controlling what goes on at the supply chain in order to satisfy customers’ needs in a quick, efficient manner.  There are six key elements to a supply chain: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information. Managers of business use these six key elements to provide the best customer service to customers. \n\tProduction is the first step in the supply chain process. Production is the foundation for the entire supply chain process. The production stage will outline the when, why, where, and how everything will be produced. Managers need to know what customers want. In order for managers to know what customers want, managers can look at the market. The market is the biggest indicator to decide what the customer demands are.  Once Managers have analyzed the market and understand customer’s demand they are ready to decide what products should be produced, and how many of those products should be produced. After the management has decided what is produced and how many, they are ready to decide where the products should be produced and at which plant will be best for volume and quality of good, keeping in mind the customer demand and satisfaction must be met.  After the location for production of the products has been decided, the next step is managers’ focus on scheduling workloads, and maintenance of equipment. Production is a very important step in the supply chain process.  Every detail is vital throughout the whole process. If every detail is not planned accordingly, it could cost the company a lot of time and money in the long run. For example, I use to work at Wal-Mart and Target retail stores. Both companies have a design, booklet, and process for every entity of the business. There is a designed layout of how an employee’s uniform should look to receiving shipment from trucks. Having outlined processes allow a company to work smoothly without confusion of direction and expectations. \n\tThe second key element in the supply chain management is supply. Supply is defined as the strategic decisions that should be made to determine the core capabilities of a facility and outsourcing partnerships should grow from these decisions. A company may have many different divisions of production for a single product.  All division consists of different equipment, workers, and specialties. The manager must decide which division is a best fit for the different processes of the product.  Management may also decide to outsource the work to other companies. The core reason a manager would outsource the work to companies is to create velocity. Velocity is the ability to provide quality and flexibility while at the same time reducing costs or maintaining low cost levels. ",
            "\nHitler is alive in Burma, the sign says.\n\nEllen Page, star of Juno, stands alone on a street corner with a piece of cardboard held above her head, the unsettling message scribbled with Sharpie onto her sign. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeastern Asian country ruled by a tyrannical militant junta who came into power in 1962 through the act of a coup d’état. In 2007 a number of street protests occurred, the first public protests in a decade. Led by a large number of Burmese monks, these protests earned the name “The Saffron Revolution”, christened after the color of the robes that the monks wore. After the first few initial uprisings the public at large began taking an interest in the protests, and while at first the Burmese government begrudgingly allowed the monks to engage in peaceful gatherings, soon the violence escalated into what some considered an all-out war between the monks and the military junta, with the military actively invading and ransacking monasteries around the country. Foreign journalists were rounded up and imprisoned on sight, with a Japanese photojournalist named Kenji Nagai killed on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a street protest. While the official death toll rests at 13 killed, Colonel Hla Win, who defected from the army some days prior to the official report, is quoted as having said, “Many more people have been killed in recent days than you’ve heard about. The bodies can be counted in several thousand.”\n\nThis is nothing new. While these are some of the most recent examples of atrocities taking place in our world, a government’s desire to quash dissent and maintain complete rule over its citizenry has been around for as long as civilization itself. Early Roman emperors declared themselves chosen by the gods to have complete executive ruling over every aspect of their society. Japanese emperors are believed to actually be gods, sent to our world to lead their people to prosperity through the invention of Motorola cell phones and hara-kiri, and our current president, George W. Bush, has weekly conference calls with Ted Haggard, the leader of Stupid People Worldwide, a subsidiary group of the Republic Party.\n\nSome of the most well known examples of these actions are such incidents as the 1989 June 4th protest at Tiananmen Square, where intellectuals, labor activists, and students all gathered to protest the authoritarian rule of the government. The death toll in that particular instance ranges wildly, with official reports from the Chinese government stating 200-300 dead to reports let out by the Chinese Red Cross, declaring between 2,000-3,000 dead.  Another is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militia groups, aided by the Rwandan government, began a systematic killing of all Tutsis, as well as political moderates, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. Hitler’s ‘Third Reich’, a period spanning several years and several countries where anyone of Jewish background was rounded up and killed, is another extreme example. ",
            "\nDuke Ellington’s legacy in jazz derives in large part from his longevity and, by extension, his creative abilities to shape his orchestra. Ellington’s presence on the piano is subtle in many of the compositions selected for this assignment, but as a composer Ellington excelled at creating rich and complex pieces that showcased the individual abilities of band members. Ellington crafted the framework in which a soloist could freely improvise, in addition to writing tightly orchestrated pieces and phrases that called on the particular style of band members to highlight musical ideas. In doing this, he also emphasized the tone of the orchestra more generally, creating coherent and original sounds to fit each piece. Ellington’s mastery of the individual players’ sound, as well as how they fit together in a growing ensemble, enabled him to write some of the most innovative and brilliant pieces in jazz history.\nThe Grove Music dictionary, in discussing Ellington’s sound and innovation, mentions Creole Love Call in reference to using voice “as a jazz instrument” throughout his career.  This is an early example of Ellington’s use of voice to add texture and color without the hindrance of lyrics. Creole Love Call also demonstrates Ellington’s ability to compliment the style of his soloists, something that is evident throughout his career. This slow, deliberate twelve bar blues piece contains six choruses, as follows:\nChorus 1: Call and response between voice and reeds, where the voice begins smooth and melodic, then transitions to a rougher sound towards the end.\nChorus 2: Muted trumpet solo that elaborates on the basic melody and emphasizes several extended blue notes.\nChorus 3: Sweeping clarinet solo in a high register, backed by a subtle syncopated piano phrase.\nChorus 4: Full band echoes the first chorus with a call and response by the brass and reed sections.\nChorus 5: The climactic chorus of the piece, as the reeds now begin the call and response in a high register, backed by syncopated stop time from the brass and rhythm sections.\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, with call and response between voice and reeds. In this chorus the voice takes on the sound of the “growl” technique, soloing as an instrument.\nTag: Brief tag featuring a vocal run and a dissonant novelty ending by a trombone.\nEllington’s use of voice to add a dimension of tone color to this piece is one example of a stylistic trait that permeates his work. \nIn Hot and Bothered, recorded a year later, Ellington combines his skill at tight orchestration with his ear for tone color. A call and response phrase between “Bubber” Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox’s scat singing uses the vocal elements of Miley’s playing and instrumental aspects of Cox’s voice to create a rich and complementary sound. It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing) extends these ideas, as Ellington uses Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton, a mainstay in Ellington’s orchestra, to great effect in introducing the melody on muted trombone.

            "\n\nShe had always felt like she needed something. It was this desire that refused to be fulfilled. It started when she was about 14, just getting into a teenage life. And it was still there 3 years later, at the age of 17. By now, she had determined she wanted someone rather than thing. Yet, she had felt no interest in any boys. Some had been attracted to her, gone through the awkward attempts to woo the un-woo-able, but no one appealed to her. She questioned herself often with this strange notion, trying to think of what it was that could possibly cause such a strange thing to happen with a teenage girl. The few years of contemplation had brought up theories, but nothing good enough for her to really speculate on. So she lived life, continually questioning her desires.\n\nA day at home was usually a peaceful thing. Her parents were good and calm people. They never argued with each other and oddly enough, arguments with their daughter were very seldom. The only thing they ever argued about was her asserting her independence and free personality. She was the daughter of a very calm couple, but she definitely countered their energies with her extensive and fun personality which made her very like-able in combination with the fact she was a nice person.\n\nToday, though, was not a calm day. As she walked from room to room, attempting to find some new inspiration for her own her, she heard a short scream from the kitchen, the sound of her mother's beautiful voice. She ran into the room, starting to panic as she frantically questioned, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?!\" She saw her mother lying on the ground, appearing to be in pain as she continually kept saying \"Ow\" in short breaths. The mother's daughter ran to her side and put a hand on her to attempt assistance. \"Ouch ... swee - ty, I ... need you to take me to - the hospital.\" The words were rushed and squeezed and her daughter could tell she was in immense pain. \"Okay Mom, just tell me where I can pick you up.\" Her mother directed her hands and at this moment, the hero of the house was very grateful she had taken classes to strengthen herself. She carried her mother to the car, set her in the back lying down, and drove.\n\nA visit to the hospital brought scents of disinfectant and sickness, laced with fear. But she wasn't sensing that, as her mind was too occupied with helping her mother. She carried the injured woman in quickly and started calling for help from the doctors. A few worried faces gathered around and someone quickly pulled up a rolling bed and laid her mother down on it. They took her to be immediately looked at, and her daughter was left to sit in worry.\n\nHer mother had fallen off of a stepping stool while attempting to grab a vase from the highest cabinet they had.

            "\nThis study was to show that adherence to a “Mediterranean Diet” (Med diet), as reflected by a high “alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score”, is associated with reduced risk of chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke and stroke mortality.  The aMed diet is a modified version of the Med diet and is characterized by higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins (excluding potatoes, but including fruits, nuts, whole grains and legumes), monounsaturated fat (compared to saturated fat) and fish, and lower consumption of animal products and saturated fats.  Moderate intake of alcohol is allowed.\n  \t\n\nPrior prospective studies documented an inverse association between adherence to a Med diet and risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality and an intervention trial showed the Med diet to be more effective than a low-fat diet, in promoting weight loss and lowering the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese individuals.  Prior studies did not focus on stroke or stroke mortality.\n\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, 38 to 63 years of age, without a history of CVD or diabetes, who are participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses in 11 US states.  Six times, from 1984 to 2004, the authors computed an aMed diet score from self-reported “food frequency questionnaires” (“FFQs) designed to assess nutrient intake during the preceding year.  More than 95% of nurses continued participation throughout the 20 year period. FFQs were subjected to validation studies.  Reports of CHD, fatal CHD and stroke were confirmed by review of medical or hospital records, autopsy or death certificates. Where records were not available, cases were considered “probable” and included, with about 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts so classified. Body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone were calculated for each FFQ, and beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was assessed. \n\nTo reduce random variation for an individual and better represent long-term dietary intake, cumulative averages of the aMed score from the repeated FFQs were calculated (averaging together scores from two prior years).  Adjustments were made for “confounders” (factors that could confuse results) by adjusting for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was used to assess the association between an aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, using separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke types. \n\nGreater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher aMed diet score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.  During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were found. Women in the top aMed quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71). ",
            "\n\n\tIn 2007, the United States of America fell into a crushing financial crisis. Unemployment increased, the housing market crashed, and many of America’s largest and most important corportations were left in ruin. This recession persists today, so we must ask the question: how did this crisis occur, and how can we stop it? In short, the financial crisis was created by selfish and naïve political decision-making that pressured banks and firms into issuing sub-prime loans into an already immature and unsufficient financial infrastructure. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were pressured to underwite and repackage these mortgages into CDO’s and CDS’. When borrowers defaulted on these loans, the banks were short on capital reserve and transferred this chaos onto the repacked mortgages that they had sold, and on to the rest of the economy.\n\tThe financial crisis had its roots in 1999 of the Clinton era, as the President was aiming for a second term in office. He sought to extend his presidential tenure by augmenting his popularity. To accomplish this the Clinton administration relaxed lending restrictions, which helped to set the grim stage for the sub-prime crisis seven years later.  Steven Holmes of the New York Times reported in 1999, “Fannie Mae, the nation's biggest underwriter of home mortgages, has been under increasing pressure from the Clinton Administration to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people and felt pressure from stock holders to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits.” Holmes would go on to correctly foresee the consequences of these actions: “But the government-subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.” As detailed in the introduction, and as Holmes foresaw, ill-advised lending would certainly lead to the meltdown of the economy.\n\tMany factors combined to throw the economy into tailspin, one of which was the new and complex structure of mortgages. Adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) were all used extensively in the years leading up to the crisis, and only served to intertwine more sectors of the economy into the housing market. This led to U.S. households, and financial markets in general, to overleverage themselves in the housing market, leaving them extremely vulnerable to even small changes in price. \n\tIndeed, the housing bubble burst, and the financial institutions that had bought these mortgage-backed securities were spited. The top five U.S. investment banks all together reported $4.1 trillion dollars of mortgage debts in 2007, which accounted for about 30% of the USA’s GDP. In the end, Bear Sterns and Merrill Lynch were sold exceptionally cheap, Lehman Brothers was dismantled, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were forced to become commercial banks subjected to intense regulation. Fannie and Freddie were $5 trillion in mortgage debt, and were placed under government control in September 2008.\n",
            "\nAh, exposition.  That place in your story where you stretch your little writer's wings and take flight, astounding one and all with your magnetic, nay magical prose.  Or the part where your readers fall asleep and/or hit the \"Back\" button while cursing your name.  Dr. Merlin has been known to shout at her monitor when she finds herself in the middle of Too Much Information, and not even in the fun way.\n\nExposition is not your friend.\n\nMy gentle readers already know the basic writing tip, \"Show, don't tell,\" but Dr. Merlin still stumbles into long passages of text where nothing happens, or worse, too much.  Exposition is the little devil sitting on your shoulder that says to get the history out of the way to get to the good parts (not to be confused with the devil sitting on the other shoulder urging the author to tell her audience every single detail of the childhoods of each character).\n\nExposition means telling the audience what happened, typically in simple prose.  In film, the exposition happens when one character tells another a core-dump of information ala \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"  In fiction, the author's doing the telling.\n\nAn example is in order.  As you are reading a story, you are told that the heroine met her beloved at such a place and time, that they were married in a gala fashion, and that her husband was murdered in front of her eyes.  You would not expect this entire sequence to take two pages, during which time both he and she only get two lines of dialogue each.  You would expect the author to spend some time on the husband's character, evidencing by his speech and manner how deeply he loves his wife, and you would equally expect the heroine to show through big and small ways how much his presence in her life changed and enriched her (especially if the story were to tell you flat out later that this was the case).  A proper introduction to the husband's character would allow you to become emotionally involved with his fate and would give you insight into the heroine's character: what she saw in him, how deep their bond was, clues about her thoughts and beliefs and dreams as reflected through the prism of his eyes, and so on.  You would mourn his death with her, and so grow more connected to the heroine herself.\n\nIn short, you would expect meat on the simple bone of the storyline: \"They met, they married, he died.\"\n\nAs a writer, you need to provide that meat.  (*looks at metaphor, sighs, plunges onward*)  Sometimes it is tempting to rush past certain things.  Perhaps you're introducing a new character and you know he used to be in the Air Force, and he's the night manager of a gas station now, and he was married twice, no kids, likes to go fishing on the weekends, secretly dreams of owning the gas station someday and had Eggs Benedict for breakfast.

            "\n\tI watched two newscast’s from Columbus, Ohio. The first one that was “live” was NBC 4 this morning (August 13, 2011). The lead story was about a man in Ashley, Ohio who had stabbed his wife, it did not state her name however his name was Shad Hostettler. They showed his mug shot and he looked like pure evil. They devoted only about two minutes to this story as it was developing. The only details they provide he had stabbed her multiple times and had been arrested. I think they spent an appropriate amount of time on this story. \n\tThe second story was about an early morning shooting of Travis Buyers, 18. He was shot in the Sharon Woods area and had been critically injured; there had been no arrests made at the time or any suspects. The SWAT Team was investigating the crime. This story seemed to be short, and I believe that might have been due to the fact this was a “black” man or a black neighborhood. I noticed (and have for years) that minorities are glossed over when they are a victim of a crime. If say a “white” child or adult is kidnapped or missing or a victim of a crime the media goes nuts; but if a minority person it’s lucky if it is even mentioned. \n\tThe next story was about the gunshot hole that had been found in the Med-Flight helicopter. Details were given about where they thought the incident happened. It had been determined that it was a .22 caliber bullet from a rifle that had hit the helicopter. Crime-Stoppers are offering a five-thousand dollar reward for tips that lead to the arrest of the shooter. \n\tThe next story was concerning the rain and thunderstorms predicted for Saturday afternoon. They said the temperatures would remain in the mid to low eighties for the weekend. The length of time was a little short, but they wanted to use it as a “teaser” so that you would stay tuned. \n\tThey also ran with a story about a robbery of a Clime Road UDF in Columbus. They said it was dark-skinned black man who robbed the store he was wearing a hoodie sweatshirt. They said he was about six-foot tall and weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds. I thought they devoted an unusual about of time emphasizing he was black and how dark he was. \n\tAnother story was about a Rene Rodriguez who was a convicted Texas Drug-Kingpin. He had been convicted of conspiring to distribute marijuana in large amounts to Ohio from Texas. One curious thing I noted, was instead of saying he was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison they said “300” months. I am not sure what the angle was there, whether they thought that sounded more harsh or what. They also mentioned he was a Hispanic man, I don’t believe that was really germane to the story. ",
            "\n\tThere is a bond between brothers; an unbreakable, irrevocable bond. Within that bond lie many emotions: love, pride, jealousy, and cruelty, just to name a few. Brothers understand one another, far more than anyone else with that kind of bond, and they can only see themselves when looking at their brother. It is when a situation is at its most dire when the true nature of this bond shines through, be it good or evil. When these emotions become clear, they carry with them great a cost. Part of understanding the emotions born of this fraternal link is dealing with the consequences that they bring. When one can look a brother in the eye and see within that person their own reflection, they see themselves not as others see them, but as they truly are. In their actions and the consequences of those actions is where their true character lies.  In “The Scarlet Ibis”, two brothers explore this theme, and all of the raging emotions that accompany it. Throughout a lush, vividly described landscape, these two boys set out on a futile journey. Bitter disappointment clashes with intense pride in the climactic scene, and only one brother escapes with his life. The theme is expressed through direct characterization of the protagonist, Doodle, and their interactions with each other, as well as through the narrator’s point of view, which communicates the complex feelings experienced by the protagonist and his view of the world around him, both of which are heavy influences on his actions.\n\tThe protagonist’s actions can all be summed up by one key emotion: pride. From the time he and his little brother, Doodle, first go out together, to their final, fateful excursion, the protagonist feels resentment towards Doodle. He had wanted a brother whom he could teach all of his worldly skills, like “…holding my breath, running, jumping, or climbing the vines in Old Woman Swamp…” He wanted a brother who could fill the role of “…someone to race to Horsehead Landing…and someone to perch with in the top fork of the great pine behind the barn…” Obviously these things are impossible, given Doodle’s condition. Doodle was born with an extremely weak heart, making in unlikely he would even survive. Even then, it was nearly impossible that he would ever participate in vigorous physical activity. What a blow to the young protagonist, his head filled with wild fantasies, to have all of those dreams crushed in an instant. In fact, he is even shown to bear some anger towards the small child, as he recalls beginning to contemplate killing him by suffocating him with a pillow. What kind of child would have the presence of mind to consider infanticide? However, his heart melts when the small child smiles at him. Such a simple act gave the protagonist such hope! This shows that his conviction probably was not very strong. In the back of his mind, he had an instinctive love for his brother. ",
            "\nThe human brain is a complicated, creative information-processing system. As technology advanced from primitive to modern, the metaphors used to describe the brain also advanced. Initially, it was compared to a wax tablet, then to a sheet of papyrus, then to a book, and most recently, to a computer. As you learn about the brain, keep in mind that the usefulness of these metaphors is limited and can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nInformation processing starts with input from the sensory organs, which transform physical stimuli such as touch, heat, sound waves, or photons of light into electrochemical signals. The sensory information is repeatedly transformed by the algorithms of the brain in both bottom-up and top-down processing. For example, when looking at a picture of a black box on a white background, bottom-up processing puts together very simple information such as color, orientation, and where the borders of the object are – where the color changes significantly over a short space – to decide that you are seeing a box. Top-down processing uses the decisions made at some steps of the bottom-up process to speed up your recognition of the box. Top-down processing in this example might help you identify the object as a black box rather than a box-shaped hole in the white background.\nOnce information is processed to a degree, an attention filter decides how important the signal is and which cognitive processes it should be made available to. For example, although your brain processes every blade of grass when you look down at your shoes, a healthy attention filter prevents you from noticing them individually. In contrast, you might pick out your name, even when spoken in a noisy room. There are many stages of processing, and the results of processing are modulated by attention repeatedly.\nIn order for the brain to process information, it must first be stored. There are multiple types of memory, including sensory, working, and long-term. First, information is encoded. There are types of encoding specific to each type of sensory stimuli. For example, verbal input can be encoded structurally, referring to what the printed word looks like, phonemically, referring to what the word sounds like, or semantically, referring to what the word means. Once information is stored, it must be maintained. Some animal studies suggest that working memory, which stores information for roughly 20 seconds, is maintained by an electrical signal looping through a particular series of neurons for a short period of time. Information in long-term memory is hypothesized to be maintained in the structure of certain types of proteins.\nThere are numerous models of how the knowledge is organized in the brain, some based on the way human subjects retrieve memories, others based on computer science, and others based on neurophysiology. The semantic network model states that there are nodes representing concepts, and that the nodes are linked based on their relatedness. For example, in a semantic network, “chair” might be linked to “table,” which can be linked to “wooden,” and so forth. ",
            "\nAldous Huxley criticizes the upcoming threat of both technology and the capitalistic structure by which it is reinforced through the creation of a dystopia in the novel Brave New World. Its people value community above the individual, and are conditioned from the very beginning to pursue immediate happiness above all else. The citizens are revealed to be pawns in a larger game, confined to one ideology as dictated by the World Controller. By examining the work under the lenses of Marxist theism, one notices the underlying suspicions of the author in regards to the development of aforementioned systems. Frequent terminology in Marxism, such as homogeny and reification, among others, reinforce the idea that Huxley’s novel is a commentary on the faults in the emerging economy from his time on.\nCapitalism is satirized through the use of the Marxist thesis known as false consciousness. Essentially, the common citizenry is prevented from knowing true relations to other classes in economic terms, as they are primarily interested in their own gain. It is said to be the result of ideological control of the proletariat and common laborers, something quite obvious by the conditioning of the people in Brave New World. The common classes, Delta, Gamma, etc., have no true will of their own; through hypnopædia the drive to consume, to spend, to indulge is strengthened above all else.  This is manipulated, as previously stated, by the World Controller.  Hegemony, essentially the idea that groups of social classes are dominated by  a separate group of individuals in totality, is obviously used in this case. The lower classes are entirely unaware of the manipulation, quite literally ‘[buying]  into an ideology that supports that structure’ (i.e. capitalism & consumerism). ’ Upper classes are born with the ability to be aware of it but do nothing ; few Alphas or Betas beyond characters like Bernard do much more than likewise accept their place.  In fact, the  interactions of the social classes, as will be discussed  in greater length, are significant indications of the perceived oppression of capitalism.\nRelationships between disparate individuals does not exist in Brave New World.  The novel seemingly refuses to distinguish the characters - they are, even  among major characters, lacking depth. Perhaps Huxley is suggesting that the rise of technology and capitalism together deprive man of their free will and expression. Love does not exist, nor do the extremes of any one emotion; rather, interactions are kept superficial, portrayed distinctly through  the males remarks  about women primarily about their physical appearance (i.e. pneumatic quality), and the females’  unashamed  comments about their encounters, so to speak.  Furthermore, each societal class’ complacency with their status in the hierarchy  indicate  the socioeconomic effect of capitalism.  Their absolute obedience of their part in the community is an indication of Marxist thought on the proletariat, who are falsely ensured of their own superiority over all else so long as they continue to consume, to obey, to stay in line with the rest of their peers.\n",
            "\nI have been a student here at University Park for about two and a half years now, or four and a half semesters. For many, including myself, getting around on campus can be a problem. My freshman year I was placed in an East Halls dorm room; pretty much the furthest eastward limit of campus, not counting the stadium and Bryce Jordan Center. Traveling from my home in Stuart Hall to classes in such faraway places as Willard building, near the center of campus, could take up to 25 minutes by foot, especially if the weather was bad, as it often is in State College. Speaking to an alum not much older than myself, I learned that not long ago the East Halls dorms were set apart from the rest of the school by huge tracts of unused land. Today that empty space has been filled with sports fields, huge new buildings including the new Creamery and new health services building, and surrounded with apartments. As our campus continues to expand, getting from one place to another becomes more and more difficult. What is the best solution to the problem of mobility? On a college campus, it is the bicycle. But the bike by itself won't solve any problems. Students need to ride them, and the campus needs to be built to suit the needs of bicyclists.\n\tI was talking to a friend of mine who recently resumed bicycling after a several-year hiatus. He mentioned that he wondered why he ever stopped. “Bikes are great,” he said, “for a few years it wasn’t cool to ride a bike, but it’s the only way to get around.” In addition to being good for your body, bicycling is the most efficient way to travel. A bowl of oatmeal and a little physical exertion will take you 30 miles or more. Like many undergraduates, I now live off campus; just as far from the center of campus as some dorms. The smartest decision I’ve made this year was to buy a bike. Every day, I have class in Thomas building, easily a twenty-five-minute walk from my home. Riding a bike can cut that time down to 5 minutes if I pedal fast enough. The only problem is, Pollock Road is the straightest shot to Thomas building from my house, and it's not always an easy road to travel on, bike or no bike. There are things to be said for walking as well, but personally I’m too busy to walk. If I didn’t have my bike, walking would be my only reliable option for getting to class. Walking to Thomas every day would take an extra 30-40 minutes out of my day. That’s over two and a half hours every week. Add to that all the other time I would have to spend walking to and from other classes, appointments, and etc. That’s more time than I can spare. "

            "My passion for social work stems from a deep desire to champion the well-being of children facing adversity, particularly those who have experienced abuse or neglect. I envision myself working within the Division of Family and Children Services, providing vital support to both vulnerable children and their families navigating challenging times.  The core values that I bring to this field – service, respect, ethical conduct, and a commitment to fostering healthy relationships – are not merely professional ideals; they are deeply ingrained principles that guide my personal life as well.\n\nMy journey towards social work began with a lifelong yearning to make a positive impact on the world.  During my high school and college years, I observed how some individuals struggled to cope with their problems, resorting to unhealthy or unproductive methods. Witnessing these struggles solidified my desire to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. While my initial goal was to understand human behavior, I wasn't certain about a specific career path. A pivotal experience occurred during a summer break after graduating from Piedmont College in 2009.  A friend introduced me to a troubled teenager seeking refuge from an abusive home environment. This encounter sparked a profound realization within me.  Driven by a desire to help, I reached out to the boy's parents, offering my support and sharing my educational background. Although the situation highlighted the limitations of legal intervention, it ignited a passion within me to pursue a career where I could directly advocate for children in need.\n\nSocial justice is another fundamental value that resonates deeply with me.  As a society, we often celebrate individuality while simultaneously promoting conformity. This apparent contradiction raises questions about our true commitment to embracing uniqueness. I believe in challenging social norms and advocating for equality for all. Throughout my academic years, I actively participated in protests and demonstrations against injustice, expressing my individuality through my appearance, associations, and unwavering support for marginalized communities.  \n\nMy passion for social justice fuels my commitment to making a tangible difference in the world.

            "This examination explores the biological and sociocultural perspectives on insomnia. The biological model concentrates on inherited genetic predispositions and medical health factors. Conversely, sociocultural models investigate the influence of environmental factors like race, ethnicity, demographics, and socioeconomic status on sleep patterns. This analysis delves into these models, examining selected research to illuminate their intricacies and provide a comprehensive understanding.  Each study's findings are critically assessed, highlighting both strengths and limitations.\n\nSleep disorders can be classified into three primary categories: primary sleep disorders, sleep disorders linked to other mental health conditions, and sleep disorders arising from external factors. Primary sleep disorders encompass Dyssomnias and Parasomnias. Dyssomnias, characterized by difficulties initiating or maintaining sleep, include Primary Insomnia, Primary Hypersomnia, Narcolepsy, Breathing-Related Sleep Disorder, Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder, and Dyssomnia Not Otherwise Specified (NOS).  Parasomnias, on the other hand, involve abnormal behaviors or physiological events during sleep, such as Nightmare Disorder, Sleep Terror Disorder, Sleepwalking Disorder, and Parasomnias Not Otherwise Specified. Sleep disorders associated with mental health conditions are often linked to either Axis I (clinical disorders) or Axis II (personality disorders or mental retardation) diagnoses. This review primarily focuses on insomnia, with some exploration of broader primary sleep disorders, through the lens of biological and sociocultural models.\n\nThe biological model of sleep disorders emphasizes the role of genetics, inherited traits, and physiological factors in sleep regulation. Research has shown that neurons in the hypothalamus containing orexin play a crucial role in controlling sleep-wake cycles. A study utilizing mice models revealed the presence of phenotypic GABAB receptors on orexin neurons, specifically involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness. Activation of these receptors promotes sleep, while inhibition can lead to reduced anxiety and sleep induction.  The administration of a GABAB agonist (baclofen) increased sleep duration in the mice (Matsuki et al., 2009). These findings suggest that the mouse model can be extrapolated to human studies, indicating a genetic and environmental basis for the GABAB receptor in humans. Dysfunction or absence of this receptor could potentially disrupt sleep patterns, requiring medication for adequate rest.  From a sociocultural perspective, if the phenotype is inherited, it could influence sleep regulation, and any alteration in the receptor could naturally disrupt an individual's sleep, potentially impacting various aspects of life, including academic performance, career success, and daily activities requiring focus and sustained attention.",
            "This document explores three key aspects of Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD).  Firstly, it provides a concise definition of the disorder.  Next, the diagnostic process is outlined, highlighting common indicators or \"red flags\". Finally, the document concludes by offering strategies that teachers in inclusive classroom settings can implement to support students with CAPD. \n\nCentral Auditory Processing Disorder, or Auditory Processing Disorder (APD), describes the efficiency and effectiveness with which the central nervous system (CNS) utilizes auditory information.  The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (2005) defines CAPD as the perceptual processing of sound within the CNS and the underlying neurobiological activity that drives this processing, resulting in electrophysiological auditory potentials. Essentially, it's a condition where the brain struggles to properly process what is heard. Individuals with CAPD possess normal hearing acuity and are not classified as \"hearing impaired.\"  The challenge lies in the brain's ability to translate sound, differentiating words and separating conversations from background noise.\n\nThe earliest mention of this disorder, then known as \"auditory imperception,\" dates back to the mid-1950s (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). Researchers were studying children with communication disorders. An Italian research team, composed of Bocca, Calearo, and Cassinari, began developing tests for these children in 1954. Building upon this work, Kimura introduced dichotic testing in 1961, formulating a model to explain the physiology of the CNS underlying dichotic perception (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). A national conference held in 1977 spurred further research on children with CAPD.\n\nCAPD presents itself in various ways.  Individuals with CAPD may have difficulty localizing sounds, distinguishing between auditory events, recognizing sound patterns, or differentiating changes in speech, such as detecting sarcasm based on tone. They might experience auditory blocking, where one sound obscures the preceding one, and may struggle to synthesize auditory clues into meaningful information. Additionally, they may have difficulty determining the sequence of auditory information (Ferre).\n\nDiagnosing CAPD involves a comprehensive evaluation that includes systematic observation of listening behavior and performance on auditory function tests.  Audiologists, speech-language pathologists, psychologists, and other qualified professionals utilize a variety of measures to assess auditory-related skills (American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 2005). This assessment may encompass questionnaires, surveys, and observations of auditory behaviors in response to specific stimuli.  Currently, there is no single, universally accepted test for diagnosing CAPD, and the underlying cause of the disorder remains unknown. Many tests present individuals with multiple simultaneous auditory stimuli and require them to differentiate specific items, such as words or numbers.  More advanced tests involve recording acoustic signals within the ear and measuring the responses to these signals.",
            "The play \"Twelfth Night\" explores the complexities of disguise, suggesting that while it can be effective for extended periods of deception, it ultimately carries a risk of losing one's true identity. Ending such a charade presents a significant challenge, as it may lead to social alienation.  Ultimately, individuals face a difficult choice: preserving their authentic selves or maintaining relationships with others who may be negatively impacted by the revelation.  \n\nWhile some might react neutrally to uncovering a deception, others could experience offense or resentment. The play delves particularly into the complications of gender role reversal as a form of disguise, raising questions about the motivations behind such a choice. In Viola's case, her assumption of a male identity, \"Cesario,\" is driven by a need for self-preservation in a foreign land. As she states, she seeks refuge with a \"captain\" who aided her in a past situation (\"I’ll bring you to a captain in this town/ Where lie my maiden weeds, by whose gentle help/ I was preserved to serve this noble count…\" (5.1.247-249)). \n\nHowever, this strategy isolates her from female companionship, severing a crucial support network.  Furthermore, her convincing portrayal of masculinity leads to Olivia's infatuation, creating a complex web of mistaken identities. Olivia's declaration, \"Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay,\" (5.1.138) highlights the confusion and unintended consequences of Viola's disguise.  Additionally, Viola grapples with her own suppressed feelings for Orsino, who expresses his admiration for her: \"Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times/ Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.\" (5.1. 260-261).\n\nWhile this might appear progressive, \"Twelfth Night\" can be interpreted as a reflection on how deception can expose hidden emotions, particularly in Olivia and Orsino. Certain passages suggest that these characters harbor unexpressed desires, brought to the surface by the presence of Viola/Cesario. For instance, is Olivia's attraction to Cesario rooted in his perceived masculinity, or does it reveal a deeper, unexamined inclination towards women?  One could argue that Olivia's swift shift of affection from Cesario to Sebastian, coupled with her eventual acceptance of Cesario/Viola as family (\"A sister, you are she,\" (5.1.315)), suggests she is more likely satirizing the superficial judgments prevalent in her era.",
            "German colonial rule is remembered for its harsh realities, particularly the atrocities committed against the Ovaherero and Nama people in German South West Africa.  However, such a vast empire cannot be reduced to a single narrative. The German colonial experience was as multifaceted as its geographical expanse, encompassing a range of policies and governing styles. Educational initiatives across the colonies mirrored this diversity. When the British assumed control of German East Africa (Tanganyika) in 1919, they encountered a significant population of educated and literate Africans, a testament to German educational efforts.  Contemporary accounts also lauded German educational endeavors in Kamerun and other colonies. \n\nSouth West Africa, however, presented a stark contrast. Unlike East Africa, where the colonial government established public schools and actively participated in the education of the indigenous population, the responsibility for native education in South West Africa was largely entrusted to missionary societies, albeit with limited government support. The German government, however, did invest considerable resources in the education of Europeans within the colony, establishing a system of state schools and providing substantial support and oversight for missionary institutions. These contrasting educational policies had enduring consequences for South West Africa, extending even beyond the period of German rule. While other German colonies boasted significant numbers of literate and educated Africans, South West Africa remained largely untouched by formal education, with the vast majority of the population remaining uneducated and illiterate. A confluence of social, political, and economic factors contributed to this divergent experience. This paper aims to delve deeper into these factors, particularly by examining new research on the perspectives and attitudes of settlers and colonial authorities towards the indigenous African population.\n\nA substantial body of literature explores education within the German colonial empire.  Most of these sources are in German and originate from the early twentieth century, spanning the period of and immediately following German colonial rule.  Early works primarily focused on describing the characteristics of educational systems in these colonies.  Subsequent English-language writings expanded the discourse through comparative studies of education across the various German colonies and more in-depth analyses of specific aspects of education. These studies highlighted significant variations in the educational systems implemented in different colonies.  The most prominent work directly addressing the topic of this paper is Cohen’s study of education in both South West Africa and East Africa. Cohen compares the educational systems of these two colonies and investigates the factors contributing to the observed differences.  Cohen posits that the substantial settler population in South West Africa is a key factor explaining the distinctive features of the colony’s educational system.\n\nCompared to other German colonies, South West Africa enjoyed a relatively temperate climate, though much of the territory is characterized by arid desert.  The European population of South West Africa reflected these relatively favorable conditions. By 1913, nearly 15,000 whites resided in South West Africa, while only 5,336 lived in East Africa, the colony with the next largest settler population.",
            "The evolution of popular music over the last century has resulted in a vast and constantly expanding array of genres. Pinpointing an exhaustive list proves challenging, as most, if not all, established genres like rap, rock, country, jazz, and folk, have spawned numerous subgenres and sub-subgenres. Among these, the subgenre of heavy metal rock has emerged as one of the most diverse and expressive forms of popular music in the past four decades.  \n\nIts expressiveness stems from its ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions, often leaning towards the more somber and intense ends. The genre's diversity is evident in its early iterations, where musicians quickly recognized its inherent flexibility and began to experiment, creating unique subgenres that in turn gave rise to even more specialized offshoots, a trend that continues to this day.\n\n\nThe heavy metal movement has reached a point where the sheer number of niche groups makes it difficult to define precisely what constitutes heavy metal. It has absorbed influences from various other genres, yet its origins remain significant. To truly appreciate the metal music prevalent today, one must first grasp the nature of the heavy metal movement itself, understanding why it transcends the confines of a simple genre categorization.\n\nAt its core, metal is a movement characterized by a distinct darkness. It can be described as a \"music of more\" – more bass, more volume, more intensity, and more theatrical elements.  It moves away from primitivism, emphasizing technical proficiency; metal musicians are renowned for their mastery of their instruments, a quality that shines through in their music.  Metal is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, a movement deeply intertwined with drug culture. The psychedelic drug boom of the mid-1970s fueled a sense of experimentation and pushed musicians to create unconventional and otherworldly sounds, often attributing their creations to the influence of these substances.  It possesses visceral and often dark qualities that were relatively novel to the music scene at the time, as much popular music lacked such a connection to the darker emotional spectrum.  Later generations of metal artists have also drawn inspiration from the dark, visceral elements that were prominent in the Romantic era. Lyrics such as those found in \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles exemplify this inherent darkness:\n\n  \n\nThese lyrics, showcasing a darker side of The Beatles, evoke a sense of emotional turmoil and instability, possibly reflecting the influence of drug use. Considered by some to be one of the earliest examples of heavy metal, it was a direct response to a heavier, more intense Rolling Stones song. The Beatles aimed to demonstrate their own capacity for power and intensity, including this track on their iconic \"White Album.\"",
            "Long before the Surrealists painted their dreamlike canvases, Henri Rousseau, a Post-Impressionist artist, was meticulously crafting his own dreams, both literally and figuratively. His 1910 masterpiece, \"The Dream,\" depicts not just a woman awestruck by the wonders of her dreamland, but also reflects Rousseau's personal aspirations as a painter. From the outset of his artistic journey, he yearned for recognition, acceptance, and acclaim from fellow artists and art enthusiasts. Yet, he grappled with a significant internal conflict in pursuing this ambition.  \"The Dream\" stands as the embodiment of Rousseau's lifelong struggle: to either conform to prevailing artistic styles to gain acceptance within the art world he deeply admired, or to forge his own unique path, embracing creative independence.\n\nTo truly understand \"The Dream\" through this lens, one must first delve into Rousseau's life story. Born in Laval, a town in northwest France, on May 21, 1844, Rousseau's father was a prosperous tinsmith and hardware dealer (Shattuck 47). Despite his upbringing, Rousseau received no formal artistic training. Instead, he worked for the French municipal toll service, earning him the nickname \"gabelou,\" until the age of forty (Shattuck 46).  Tragedy struck when his first wife, Clémence, passed away, followed by the loss of eight infant children, leaving him with only his daughter, Julia, and profound grief (Shattuck 49).  Seeking solace and a new beginning, Rousseau turned to painting as a source of comfort and inspiration. Unlike his contemporaries who romanticized the peasant in their art, Rousseau, a true folk painter, captured the hopes and dreams of the everyday person.\n\nRousseau's yearning for acceptance within the art world is understandable when viewed in this context.  Not only was he self-taught and began his artistic journey later in life, but he also emerged during a time when many talented and established modern artists were gaining recognition. While he had been painting for years, Rousseau's work only began to receive widespread acclaim around the same time as Matisse's rise to prominence. According to Jan Gordon in \"Modern French Painters,\" although they were artistic rivals,  Matisse and Rousseau differed not only in style and subject matter but also in their motivations for painting.  Gordon writes, \"Matisse feared painting in a trite manner, while Rousseau aspired to paint in such a conventional style that he would be admitted to the Artiste Français\" (92).",
            "Throughout history, many brilliant minds have observed a profound connection between ethics and aesthetics, suggesting an underlying bond between truth and beauty.  I concur with this notion, believing there's a fundamental reason for this pairing.  John Keats, in his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn,\" eloquently captures this sentiment: \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty— That is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" While we often acquire knowledge through formal education or personal experiences, our understanding of ethics and aesthetics seems to transcend these conventional methods.  Both fields, as Keats implies, resemble attempts at description rather than prescription. Our explorations into morality and beauty primarily aim to decipher the reasons behind a work's artistic merit or an action's ethical implications, rather than establishing rigid rules for judging or creating good art or moral behavior.\n\nFurthermore, any critique of art or morality ultimately falls short of fully grasping the essence of what constitutes goodness or beauty.  Consider the Mona Lisa, a masterpiece by da Vinci.  Discussions about its value might revolve around elements like foreground, background, contrast, or cultural context, yet these factors fail to fully elucidate its artistic excellence. When asked about a cherished work of art or literature, individuals often express a sense of ineffable quality,  preceded by phrases like, \"There's just something about it,\" before elaborating further. I propose that both art and morality resist complete reduction to a mere description of their attributes. Flannery O'Connor aptly states, \"A story is a way to say something that can't be said any other way . . . you tell a story because a statement would be inadequate.\"  No matter how comprehensively we analyze the characteristics of a literary work, an intangible element remains, defying complete articulation.  I believe ethics shares this inherent quality.  As Wittgenstein observes, \"It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. / Ethics is transcendental.\"  It is this elusive \"something,\" this indefinable essence, which I posit as the most compelling aspect of both art and morality. This transcendental nature of both fields, I argue, forms a bridge connecting them.\n\nThe profound connection between morality and art stems from the fact that we experience both most powerfully on a  noumenal level,  a concept borrowed from Kant.  They resonate with us on a level that can be felt but not fully explained. This link intensifies when considering the art form of literature.  As McKean eloquently states, \"What most distinguishes literature from the other arts, what is, in truth, unique about the art, is its moral quality. It may be that moral standards are inappropriate to other arts, music, for instance, but they seem to be as relevant to literature as they are to life itself. Living necessarily involves values. . . . Literature is important to us precisely because of the values we find there.\"",
            "Modern Germany stands as a powerful and unified nation, its cultural tapestry woven from the alpine heights of München to the Baltic shores of Kiel.  A singular spirit pervades from the banks of the Rhine in Köln, stretching through the heart of the country to the Elbe's embrace in Dresden. Given this unique cultural blend, it's no surprise that the Germany we know today has roots in a multitude of diverse sources and ancestral tribes.\n\nGermania, the ancestral homeland of the Germanic peoples, holds a name shrouded in historical debate. Scholars and historians alike grapple with its origins. Tacitus, in his historical writings, attributed the name to the Tungrian tribe, suggesting they were previously known as \"Germans\" before crossing the Rhine and engaging in conflict with the Gauls (Tacitus, 98). Julius Caesar, in his account of the Gallic Wars, first employed the term \"Germanus\" to differentiate between the conquered Gauls and the unconquered Germanic tribes who frequently crossed the Rhine, often under questionable motivations (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  He borrowed this word from the Gauls themselves, utilizing it as a marker of distinction. While the precise meaning remains elusive, some propose it originated from a Gaulish term for a neighboring people.  In the opening chapter of his first book on the Gallic Wars, Caesar writes: “Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they (The Gauls) are continually waging war.....They contend with the Germans in almost daily battles” (Caesar, 50-40 BC).  Other theories posit that the name derives from the \"ger,\" the spear used in Germanic warfare (O.E.D, 2010), or perhaps from the Old Irish word \"garim,\" meaning \"to shout,\" suggesting a boisterous or vocal people (Names of Germany).\n\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his AD 98 work \"De Origine et situ Germanorum,\" explored the origins of the Germans, stating, “I should regard (The Germans) as aboriginal, and not mixed at all with other races through immigration or intercourse. For, in former times it was not by land but on shipboard that those who sought to emigrate would arrive.......Who would leave Asia, or Africa, for Italy for Germany, with its wild country, its inclement skies, its sullen manners and aspect, unless indeed it were his home?\" (Tacitus, 98) \n\nThe Romans, for their part, held limited interest in Germania. While they ventured into Germanic territories for resources and occasionally launched military campaigns, they largely confined their presence to the periphery of this wild and untamed land. The Germanic tribes, meanwhile, flourished along the borders of the Roman Empire, trading goods acquired from their lands and contributing their skills as soldiers within the Roman legions (Ozment, 2005, pg. 17).",
            "I lowered my gaze, my mind attempting to process the scene before me. It was a detached observation, devoid of strong emotion. I analyzed the picture with a practiced eye, yet it remained an abstract image, failing to spark any deep understanding. Thoughts flitted in and out of my consciousness, appearing and disappearing in rapid succession. My mind worked with such fluidity and precision that it felt as if I was merely experiencing the visuals, rather than forming my own thoughts about them.\n\nOnce, an artist I collaborated with suggested I read a book titled \"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.\" I'd always wanted to learn to draw, ever since I was a child, and this book promised to teach everything from the fundamentals of using a pencil to the intricate ways the brain interprets lines. One technique it emphasized was using a square frame to isolate a specific area within a complex image. Instead of being overwhelmed by intricate details, such as a bowl of fruit on a table in a kitchen connected to a dining room, the artist could focus on the simpler essence—just the bowl of fruit on a plain surface.  \n\nAs I stood before the bowl, however, I couldn't mentally construct that frame. I was completely captivated, lost in awe. Picasso had his blue period, Monet adored greenery, and the Italian Renaissance masters embraced a vibrant palette. If I harbored any artistic aspirations, this scene felt like the beginning of my journey, the start of my own story—a work I envisioned as \"Work in Brown.\"\n\nMy fingers brushed against my chosen instrument of creation, my muscles tensing and relaxing as my hand moved through space, transforming my mental intention into physical form. It felt like a potentially pivotal moment in my creative life. The water swirled, serene and smooth, crystal clear and clean. Fragments of matter detached themselves, carried away into nothingness. My muscles tensed again, twitching and spasming with a growing sense of urgency. My hand slammed down on the toilet handle once more. The offending brown package stubbornly refused to budge, clinging to the bottom of the bowl like a tenacious slug.\n\nHolding a mop loosely in my hand, my feet shoulder-width apart, a green tie feeling uncomfortably tight around my neck, I frowned slightly as I stared at the unpleasant collection of processed animal and plant matter that someone had left as a message for the unlucky bathroom cleaners at Rite Aid. A few more flushes, a few more moments of quiet contemplation, and then my hand reached for the wall beside me. Grasping the end of the toilet paper, I began wrapping it around my hand, transforming it into something resembling an oven mitt. Standing straight, then bending at the waist, my hand dipped slowly into the bowl, like a parent reaching into an oven for a Thanksgiving turkey…",
            "The alarming rate of vehicular fatalities among teenagers highlights a critical issue demanding immediate attention.  Various factors converge to create this dangerous trend, with the National Institutes of Health identifying the immaturity of the adolescent brain as a significant contributing factor.   \n\nIn addition to developmental factors, inexperience plays a crucial role.  Studies, such as one conducted by the Southern California Injury Prevention Research Center, demonstrate a direct correlation between the age of passengers and the occurrence of traffic accidents, underscoring the heightened risk associated with teenage driving, particularly when accompanied by peers. \n\nEfforts to mitigate this issue, such as provisional licenses with restricted driving hours and passenger limitations, represent temporary solutions.  The underlying problem lies in the inherent challenges faced by young drivers in adequately managing the complexities and responsibilities inherent in operating a motor vehicle. Psychologist Marvin Zuckerman, through his research cited in USA Today, suggests that even the age of 18 may be too young for full driving privileges, citing a prevalent inclination among individuals under 20 to engage in risky behavior for the sake of thrill-seeking.\n\nDelaying driving until this propensity for risk-taking diminishes could prove beneficial.  Failing to address this issue will likely result in a catastrophic surge in fatalities as the next generation of drivers, the \"echo boomers,\" reach driving age within the coming years.\n\nA straightforward legislative approach could involve continuing driver's education programs while prohibiting individuals under 18 from operating motor vehicles.  A provisional permit system could remain in place, coupled with a mandated number of supervised driving hours, mirroring the requirements of many states, such as California's 6 hours of behind-the-wheel training and 50 hours of supervised practice. Because the alarming statistics affecting teen drivers are prevalent across the nation, uniform national legislation would be a logical and potentially effective measure to safeguard young people nationwide. \n\nThe proposed legislation is not unprecedented.",
            "While exploring the Library of Congress’s historical film collection, I became fascinated by a group of early Edison films classified as “trick films.”  This collection, encompassing fifteen films from 1895 to 1901, primarily relied on innovative editing techniques to create illusions. My analysis focused on identifying the common stylistic elements found in the majority of these films, while also examining the unique characteristics that emerged in a few later examples.\n\nA defining feature of the trick film at the turn of the century is its restricted setting. These films were typically confined within a frontal proscenium, meaning the camera maintained a fixed position and did not move to follow characters or objects. This composition, drawing inspiration from both theatre and vaudeville, often resulted in limited movement within the frame, with figures primarily moving side-to-side rather than towards or away from the camera.  A prime example is the film “Uncle Josh in a Spooky Hotel” (1900), where actors enter from one side and move back and forth along a horizontal axis, remaining within the confines of the proscenium even as they exit the frame.\n\nThe frontal proscenium style also dictated the camera’s framing, favoring long and occasionally medium shots. Close-up shots were entirely absent in these early trick films. This mirrored the theatrical tradition, where the audience would observe the entire performance within the established boundaries of the stage.  \n\nFurther reinforcing this theatrical influence, most early trick films adhered to a strict “one shot equals one film” approach. This convention limited the length of most films to approximately one minute or less, depending on the frames per second used. It also restricted the narrative possibilities, as most trick films focused on short, vaudeville-inspired tricks such as magic, disappearances, and substitutions, rather than developing complex storylines. However, it is important to note that the concept of a “shot” in these films might not always align with a single physical take. A single “shot” could potentially be composed of several individual takes spliced together to create the illusion of apparition or disappearance. For instance, a closer examination of “The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots” (1895), an early trick film, reveals the moment where the physical shot of Mary’s severed “head” begins, despite the film being presented as a single, continuous shot to the viewer.",
            "John Taylor of Caroline was a fervent advocate for the principles of Republicanism, emerging as a prominent figure in its early days. Though his background was primarily agricultural, his experience in this field and his brief foray into politics shaped him into a man known for his unwavering commitment to individual liberty and limited government. His dedication to agrarian ideals served as the foundation for his political beliefs, influencing his perspectives on sovereignty, the Constitution's interpretation, and even the judicial system.\n\nTaylor envisioned the United States as possessing a unique opportunity to establish an ideal system of governance. He believed the absence of deeply rooted traditions allowed for the creation of a government truly reflective of the people's will. A strong believer in the inherent rights of individuals, he asserted that these rights were interconnected and mutually dependent. He argued that if one right were infringed upon, all would be weakened, diminishing their overall value. These fundamental rights, in his view, should exist beyond the reach of governmental control.  He contended that what some referred to as the \"state of nature\" favored those with physical strength and cunning, leading to an imbalance of power.  He believed that in a civilized society, this dynamic must be rectified.\n\nTo achieve this ideal society, Taylor proposed a government structure that acknowledged both the inherent goodness and potential for evil within human nature. He held firm to a dualistic view of morality, stating, \"As government is exercised by man, all its virtues and vices must be human\" (Ibid., pg. 167).  He defined good principles as those safeguarding private property, promoting agricultural progress, and discouraging the excesses of capitalism. He believed that a government grounded in these principles would function equitably regardless of its administration, which he acknowledged would inevitably be influenced by self-interest.  He viewed self-interest as a fundamental human motivator, but deemed it detrimental when it superseded the common good and led to the creation of self-serving sub-societies that exploited others. A well-designed government, in his opinion, was essential to contain these inherent human flaws and prevent the erosion of ethical principles.\n\nLike many of his Republican contemporaries, Taylor advocated for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, believing in a limited federal government with powers explicitly defined within its text. He recognized that an expansive federal government could become tyrannical and fiscally burdensome. However, he cautioned against a purely literal interpretation, arguing that without considering the intentions of the Founding Fathers, such an approach could lead to unforeseen and potentially harmful consequences. Furthermore, he regarded the Declaration of Independence as the true foundation of the United States, emphasizing its portrayal of the nation as a union of sovereign states rather than a single, unified entity.",
            "The data depicted in Figure 17 reveals a significant decrease in commuter log submissions during the project's third month, a trend that raised concerns.  Several factors could have contributed to this decline. The transition to winter in a New England setting likely impacted commuting patterns, particularly those relying on bicycles or walking. December, coinciding with the end of the fall semester, saw students and faculty consumed with academic demands and holiday preparations, potentially leading to a decline in log completion.  Additionally, the month-long winter break further minimized the need for campus presence, potentially causing log submissions to fall off.  The low number of logs in January, despite the resumption of classes, remains unexplained.\n\nIt is possible that the initial enthusiasm surrounding the project naturally waned over time, a common challenge for such initiatives.  To counteract this, a \"Carpool Challenge Week\" campaign was implemented in March, aiming to re-energize participation and successfully resulting in an increase in log submissions. This highlighted the importance of maintaining project momentum, navigating both general engagement fluctuations and the unique challenges posed by academic calendars and extended breaks.\n\nA fundamental obstacle for any alternative commuting program is the deeply ingrained cultural preference for automobile independence.  To encourage participation, a variety of incentives, including gift certificates to local businesses and national chains, were offered.  Exploring the impact of larger prizes, such as bicycles, hybrid vehicles, or electric cars, could have further motivated engagement and potentially mitigated the project's observed dip in participation. While the existing prizes proved sufficient initially, increasing their value throughout the project, perhaps by adding bicycles in December and a hybrid or electric car in January, might have yielded greater results.",
            "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a collection of assets, similar to index funds. However, ETFs offer greater flexibility, trading like individual stocks on stock exchanges.  \n\nETFs provide the diversification advantages of index funds while also allowing investors the benefits typically associated with individual stocks, such as short selling, margin trading, and the ability to purchase fractions of a share.  \n\nWhile these advantages are highly appealing, ETFs generally have lower expense ratios compared to traditional mutual funds.  However, it's important to note that trading ETFs incurs a commission, similar to buying or selling individual stocks.\n\nFurthermore, the ETF market boasts a wide array of options, catering to diverse investment strategies.  Even with these clear benefits, it's prudent for discerning investors to critically assess whether the advertised advantages, like diversification, are truly realized and to what extent.\n\nThis analysis will focus on ETF IHF, comparing its performance to the top ten holdings that constitute a significant portion of its assets.  The goal is to determine if owning a single ETF like IHF provides comparable benefits to holding a diversified portfolio of its constituent stocks.  Additionally, we will explore whether alternative stock combinations within this group could potentially yield a more optimal return for a given level of risk (as measured by the Sharpe ratio).\n\nExamining every holding within the ETF would be cumbersome, so we will concentrate on the top ten holdings, which collectively represent approximately 63.58% of the ETF's total assets. \n\nTo gauge how well these ten stocks represent ETF IHF as a whole, we will leverage their current asset percentages, normalized to 100%, to estimate their contributions to a portfolio's beta and return.  This assumes the portfolio were composed entirely of these ten stocks in the same proportions as held by the ETF.  The calculated beta and return values are presented in the accompanying chart.\n\nThe chart reveals that a portfolio consisting solely of the top ten holdings generated a return 6.11% higher than the ETF, translating to a 16% increase in returns.  Furthermore, the beta of these top ten holdings is 0.12 lower than that of the ETF itself.  \n\nBased on these preliminary findings, a portfolio comprising only the top ten holdings appears to offer both higher returns and lower risk (as indicated by the lower beta) compared to the ETF.  However, it's essential to consider whether these differences are statistically significant.  \n\nTo address this, we will determine the standard deviation of each of the top ten stocks and normalize it to 100% to compare their cumulative standard deviation to that of ETF IHF.",
            "Edgar Allan Poe considered \"Dream-Land\" to be among his superior poetic works. Within the poem, Poe employs the term \"Thulé\" on two occasions, a word traced back to the Roman poet Virgil by scholar Mabbott. Virgil utilized \"Thulé\" to denote an island situated north of Britain, perceived by the ancient Greeks as the outermost edge of their known world. While Virgil's usage is well-documented, another influential source should be acknowledged. Poe held a deep appreciation for German literature.\n\nThe inclusion of \"Thulé\" highlights Poe's familiarity with the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.  Karl J. Arndt, in his book \"Poe's Politian and Goethe's Mignon,\" draws parallels between Poe's poem and Goethe's verse, suggesting that Poe drew inspiration from the German master.\n\nThe Oxford Companion to English Literature describes Goethe as a renowned writer of the poetic drama \"Faust,\" published in two parts—the first in 1808 and the second upon Goethe's death in 1832.  Within the second part of \"Faust\" lies a poignant short poem titled \"The King of Thulé.\" This piece revolves around a king who, after his wife's death, descends into heavy drinking and mourning.  Overwhelmed by grief, he ultimately decides to end his life, bequeathing his possessions to his children except for a goblet, a memento of his deceased queen. He walks to a cliff, casts the goblet into the sea, closes his eyes, and takes his final breath. The character of the King of Thulé shares striking similarities with the speaker in Poe's \"Dream-Land,\" possibly reflecting Poe's own experiences with loss and reliance on alcohol. \n\n Notably, \"Faust\" was adapted into a romantic drama by H.P. Grattan in 1842, just prior to Poe's use of the term \"Thulé\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum.\"\n\nPoe references \"Thulé\" twice in his collected works. While he employs the phrase \"ultma Thule\" in \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" he utilizes \"Thulé\" twice in \"Dream-Land,\" acting as bookends for the poem.  \"The King of Thulé\" and \"Dream-Land\" can be viewed as companion pieces, with Poe's poem seeming to step directly into the emotional landscape of Goethe's work. The speaker in \"Dream-Land\" describes a desolate Thulé, plagued by darkness, loneliness, and the haunting presence of deceased friends, a world devoid of color. These elements resonate with the emotional turmoil of the King of Thulé, who, having lost his wife, grapples with profound loneliness and a loss of purpose.\n\nGoethe's literary significance would have ensured Poe's familiarity with his work, particularly given Poe's admiration for Tennyson, who was influenced by Goethe. Moreover, numerous reproductions of Goethe's works circulated after their initial publication, further exposing Poe to his writings.",
            "The question of whether a customer injured in a California grocery store from an applesauce spill could receive punitive damages hinges on the actions of the store manager.  \n\nLegally, a plaintiff seeking punitive damages must demonstrate the defendant's conduct was not merely negligent, but rather exhibited a deliberate indifference to the potential harm their actions could cause. This means proving the defendant acted with malice, which in this context, could be characterized as intentional misconduct or, in the absence of intent, a reckless disregard for the safety of others. \n\nIn this case, Jennifer Palmer's claim for punitive damages might be successful. She could argue that the manager, Paul Martin, knew of the potential danger posed by the uncleaned spill, given prior incidents of similar accidents at the store. His alleged disregard for these past incidents and his prioritization of his dinner break over customer safety could be presented as evidence of a willful and conscious disregard for the well-being of shoppers. \n\nThe strength of Palmer's claim rests on establishing the manager's actions as not just negligent, but demonstrably malicious. While the fact that six slip-and-fall incidents occurred in 2009 is compelling, proving the manager's state of mind and  conscious disregard for the risks will be crucial to securing punitive damages. \n\nThe timeline of events is significant. On October 13, 2009, two employees, Rich Wayne and Mary J. Haddigan, alerted Martin about the applesauce spill. Martin, however, dismissed their concerns, stating he was on a dinner break and unable to address customer issues.  Tragically, an hour later, Jennifer Palmer slipped on the spill, sustaining a serious back injury. This incident occurred amidst a pattern of previous slip-and-fall incidents, further strengthening Palmer's argument that Martin was aware of the potential dangers and chose to ignore them.\n\nUnder California law, punitive damages are awarded in cases where a defendant's conduct meets a high threshold of culpability.  It is for the court to determine if Martin's actions rise to this level of malice, taking into account all the evidence presented.",
            "My exploration of Islam began nearly four years ago during a course at CBC. One of the most compelling discussions we had centered around the perception of Islam – a question that feels even more crucial in today's world. Reflecting on the events since 9/11, I've witnessed a significant shift in media portrayals of Islam and its adherents in America, transitioning from a state of hostility to an almost overwhelming embrace.  It's hard to imagine, just over two decades ago, a presidential candidate like Barack Obama, with his family's undeniable Muslim heritage, even being conceivable.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad's biography captivated my attention. My prior understanding of his history painted a picture of a figure who forcefully converted individuals and subjugated tribes through military conquest. However, the biography presented a different narrative, portraying Muhammad as a misunderstood martyr, a figure who humbly engaged with others and invited them to embrace his teachings. This contrast intrigued me, as it challenged my preconceived notions.\n\nFurther comparisons between the ministries of Jesus and Muhammad's documented \"miracles\" also sparked my curiosity.  One striking example is the account of Muhammad multiplying mutton and milk to feed a multitude of people. This narrative style, emphasizing Muhammad's humility and reliance on divine guidance, led me to question whether it aimed to present him as a more relatable figure, somewhat akin to Jesus.\n\nWhile I found this approach intriguing, it also raised concerns for me. The emphasis on Muhammad's supposed miracles, while well-intentioned, seemed to diminish the unique and unparalleled significance of Jesus Christ's life and miracles. It felt as if certain aspects of Jesus's story were being subtly appropriated.\n\nThe biography also presented numerous accounts of individuals converting to Islam independently, supposedly providing evidence of its truth. However, many of these accounts relied on hearsay, recounted through multiple intermediaries. This reliance on second-hand information, while intended to lend credibility, ultimately diminished the stories' impact and introduced a sense of uncertainty.\n\nPerhaps my most significant discomfort stemmed from the biography's attempt to elevate Muhammad as a paragon of virtue – humble, wise, gentle, and endearing. This portrayal clashed with my understanding of historical accounts, which depicted a more complex figure. It left me wondering if modern Muslims are fully aware of the complexities surrounding Muhammad's rise to power.",
            "The evolution of Christian thought after the life of Jesus presents a fascinating study. While the beliefs and teachings attributed to him formed the foundation,  the path Christianity took diverged significantly from its origins.  Contemporary society, marked by a heightened awareness of progress and change, is witnessing a shift in religious landscapes.  Traditional viewpoints, though persisting within certain segments of the population, might not hold sway over the broader trend. \n\nLooking towards the future, a growing awareness of Christianity's historical development is anticipated. This will likely fuel a desire to distinguish the doctrines that emerged over time from the core principles espoused by Jesus.  This process, though potentially spanning decades or even centuries, suggests an inevitable trajectory: a return to the essence of Jesus' message.\n\nImagine a movement gaining momentum, gradually peeling away layers of accumulated doctrines, much like a clock rewinding.  This could lead to a return to a purer form of Christianity, focused solely on the teachings attributed to Jesus himself.  As this trend takes hold in regions like the United States and Europe, it could reshape religious practices and beliefs,  bringing a renewed emphasis on the simplicity of Jesus' original message.\n\nThis shift, however, might not result in a decentralized or fragmented religious landscape.  Rather, the theological pendulum could swing towards greater uniformity.  Denominational and regional differences might gradually diminish, culminating in a more unified expression of Christian faith.  History offers numerous examples of such reversals, from the Roman Empire's transformation from persecutor to adopter of Christianity to the evolution of societal attitudes towards race and equality.\n\nThe success of this envisioned reversion hinges on a reinterpretation of Jesus' words, viewing them through a metaphorical lens rather than adhering to a strictly literal interpretation.  What, then, transpired between Jesus' lifetime and the present day?\n\nTracing the origins of Christianity, we encounter Judaism, from which it emerged.  By the time the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 63 B.C.E., Judaism had already established itself as a monotheistic religion, with a divinely inspired scripture and a strong sense of religious authority.  While united in their core beliefs, the Jewish population was not monolithic, with various factions like the Sadducees, Pharisees, Essenes, Zealots, and common people coexisting within its midst.",
            "Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" presents a stark and unsettling portrait of human nature, suggesting that at its core, humanity is driven by greed and self-interest. This inherent flaw is starkly illustrated through the actions of the factory owners and managers who prioritize their own success above all else. Their relentless pursuit of profit manifests in a callous disregard for the well-being of their employees and the environment. \n\nSinclair vividly depicts the industrial landscape as a menacing force, \"the line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.\" This imagery emphasizes the environmental devastation wrought by the factories, a consequence that the owners seemingly ignore.  The disregard for human life is equally apparent in their treatment of their workforce. They exploit their employees, demanding excessive hours and offering little protection or support. This exploitation is further highlighted by the quote: \"So from the top to bottom the place is simply a seething cauldron of jealousies and hatreds; there is no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there is no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.\"\n\nThe absence of adequate labor laws during this period allowed the owners to operate with impunity, treating their workers as expendable pawns in their quest for wealth.  The workers, trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and desperation, are left to fend for themselves amidst the harsh realities of Packingtown.  Their plight is further compounded by the failure of unions to offer meaningful assistance. In fact, Sinclair portrays these organizations as contributing to the problem, enriching themselves at the expense of the very people they supposedly represent.  The desperate circumstances faced by the working class are compared to slavery, highlighting the dehumanizing nature of their exploitation.  Sinclair states, \"Here is a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances, immorality is exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it is under the system of chattel slavery.\"",
            "Authors often employ various literary devices to guide readers' emotions and perceptions of key themes. The effectiveness of these techniques can vary greatly. F. Scott Fitzgerald masterfully utilizes a range of such strategies in his novel, \"The Great Gatsby.\" One notable approach involves pairing adjectives and nouns in unconventional ways to evoke a specific ambiance surrounding a subject. Fitzgerald also imbues symbols with meaning and subsequently leverages them to achieve a similar effect.  He skillfully employs this latter technique with numerous colors, including gold, green, white/gray, and red/pink. Throughout \"The Great Gatsby,\" Fitzgerald meticulously constructs meaning associated with these colors, particularly white/gray and red/pink, which he later utilizes to trigger specific emotional responses in readers concerning significant objects.\n\nFitzgerald associates white/gray with a sense of uniformity, with white connoting a certain elegance and refinement, while gray suggests a faded, antiquated quality. This association is established early in the novel through frequent depictions of these colors. Daisy and Jordan are consistently described as being \"in white\" (8), a common attire for all characters—Nick wears \"white flannels\" (41) to Gatsby's party, Tom sports a \"white shirt\" (36) during his encounter with Myrtle, and Catherine appears \"powdered milky white\" (30). The sole exception to this monochromatic palette occurs when Nick observes Gatsby's party, where the \"halls... are gaudy with primary colors\" (40). Fitzgerald further solidifies these color associations by applying them to commonplace objects and settings. As Nick commutes to work, he travels \"down the white chasms of lower New York\" (56). At Gatsby's gatherings, the names of guests appear as \"gray names\" (61) on Nick's schedule. Catherine's apartment is described as \"one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses\"—a symbol of uniformity (28). Even ordinary individuals and places are rendered in shades of white or gray: Jordan and Daisy shared a \"white girlhood\" (19), the valley of ashes features \"gray cars\" and \"gray land\" (23), the \"Italian child\" by the railroad track is depicted as \"gray\" (26), and the dog-seller is characterized as \"a gray old man\" (27).\n\nHaving established a clear semantic framework for white/gray, Fitzgerald strategically employs these colors to signify insignificance or uniformity in relation to specific subjects. This technique is notably employed in his portrayal of Daisy. After an extended period devoid of significant use of these colors, Fitzgerald describes Daisy as \"dressed in white\" in \"a little white roadster\"; this visual cue subtly transforms Daisy's perception from a distinct character into a more uniform, almost generic entity, representing an object of Gatsby's desire and longing (74).  Fitzgerald further reinforces this impression of Daisy's homogeneity through additional instances of white and gray: \"a gray haze of Daisy's fur collar\" (18) and her \"white\" (115) dress preceding Tom and Gatsby's confrontation.",
            "San Diego County's agricultural prowess stems from its pleasant, sun-drenched climate.  A variety of crops thrive here, including tomatoes, citrus fruits, leafy greens, squash, broccoli, herbs, tree fruits like peaches and lemons, berries, honey, and peppers. The area boasts a strong demand for organic, community-supported agriculture products, with numerous local organizations facing extended waiting lists.  Organic eggs and milk are also highly sought after. Many organic farms offer tours of their operations, alongside opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, and other recreational pursuits.  This type of agricultural model presents a unique opportunity for landowners to capitalize on government programs while simultaneously enhancing habitat, thereby fostering recreational use and creating avenues for farm tours and educational programs, potentially generating income or serving educational purposes.\n\nBeyond tapping into a potentially profitable niche market, organic farming often leads to increased biodiversity in both plants and wildlife. This is due to the absence of chemicals in the soil and water. However, organic farming practices can come with higher costs compared to conventional methods.  Intensive labor and management are required to control pests and weeds, and to fertilize the soil without chemical inputs. Consequently, losses are frequently greater in organic farming compared to conventional approaches.  Furthermore, smaller organic farms may lack the economies of scale enjoyed by larger operations.  Practices beneficial to wildlife, but unrelated to organic farming, can also add to labor costs. These include planting cover crops, implementing strategic grazing rotations, managing invasive species, and actively shaping plant growth to create specific conditions, such as edge habitat or patches of open ground.  These factors highlight the reasons why a landowner in this scenario might seek financial assistance or expertise in maximizing both profitability and habitat quality.\n\nThe chosen parcel of land is located adjacent to the town of Potrero, in unincorporated San Diego County, California. It encompasses 160 acres of chaparral, non-native Mediterranean grassland, and oak woodland, situated next to the Cleveland National Forest. This land falls within the East County Southern Foothills ecoregion, as defined by the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan.  Although the plan is currently under review, it already recognizes over a hundred plant and animal species that inhabit the area.  Many of these are endangered, including the Stephens' kangaroo rat, the mountain yellow-legged frog, several butterfly species, and the California gnatcatcher; others are declining and may face endangerment in the near future, such as burrowing owls.\n\nThis region has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries before being settled by cattle ranchers and cordwood sellers in the late 1800s. This particular piece of land, part of an original homestead patent, likely served purposes such as grazing and/or wood production for many decades.  \n\nThe selection of this property was based on research conducted on a real estate website. I then explored available government programs to understand the realistic options a small farmer might consider for cost mitigation and wildlife conservation.  As a model of potential outcomes, I identified an organic farm in the same area.",
            "The impact of cultural context on negotiation cannot be overstated.  Culture, a complex and multifaceted concept, is defined as much by its absences as its presences.  It resists simplistic categorization, defying neat labels and generalizations. Statements attributing uniform traits to entire nationalities, such as \"all Russians are stubborn\" or \"all Japanese are accommodating,\" are inherently reductive and ultimately unhelpful. While recognizing broad cultural tendencies can be a starting point, a truly effective negotiator delves deeper, understanding the specific cultural nuances relevant to the negotiation at hand and how they might influence the dynamics at play.\n\nEncountering a new culture inevitably involves personal reflection, as we naturally frame our experiences through the lens of our own cultural background. This can lead to comparisons, but it is crucial to avoid imposing our own cultural assumptions onto the situation.  \n\nComprehending a foreign culture or mindset requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing historical analysis, an awareness of its potential biases, and a willingness to approach it with open-mindedness.  Rather than seeking to judge or alter it, the key lies in acceptance and adaptation. Within the context of negotiation, particularly when facing a weaker bargaining position, respecting and working within the boundaries of another culture becomes paramount.  Navigating unfamiliar territory requires sensitivity to local traditions and beliefs, which can serve as bridges to overcome cultural barriers and facilitate progress.\n\nIt's important to recognize that cultural influences extend beyond national boundaries.  Within any given nation, companies often cultivate their own distinct corporate cultures.  These cultures manifest in various ways, from work hours and dress codes to communication styles, delegation practices, and even philanthropic initiatives. The diversity of American corporate culture, ranging from demanding work environments to more relaxed settings, even within regions and urban versus suburban contexts, highlights the richness and complexity of cultural expressions.  While some cultures may appear more homogenous on the surface, this can be misleading, often masking a deeper layer of internal diversity.\n\nValues serve as the driving forces behind cultural behaviors, providing the \"why\" behind actions. Understanding these values is crucial in negotiation. For instance, a culture that prioritizes saving face or communal harmony might discourage public confrontations or criticism to avoid jeopardizing harmony. Conversely, a culture that values aggressive negotiation tactics might be less inclined to settle quickly.  \n\nWhile acknowledging these broader cultural tendencies is essential, a successful negotiator also benefits from gaining insights into their counterpart's individual values and motivations on a personal level. This personalized understanding can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the negotiation process.",
            "The statement \"The fool hath said in his heart, 'There is no God,'\" originates in Psalm 14 of the Christian Bible. This very phrase serves as the starting point for St. Anselm's argument regarding the existence of a higher power. Notably, this belief also resonates with another prominent figure, Thomas Aquinas, whom we will be analyzing.  \n\nSince both of these thinkers are defending the same concept – the existence of God, specifically the God depicted in the Bible – and our aim is to determine the strength of their respective arguments, we will, for the sake of clarity, assume they both hold this belief to be true.  Exploring alternative conceptions of God would hinder a direct comparison, as their arguments are fundamentally built upon this specific understanding.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge that neither argument ultimately provides a complete or irrefutable foundation for belief in God.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's first delve into St. Anselm's reasoning. Anselm's approach emphasizes the role of faith and introspection in attaining knowledge of God. He posits that because God exists within our comprehension, we cannot fully grasp the idea of his non-existence. While his presentation can be dense and occasionally ambiguous, the core idea is that the proof for God's existence resides within our own minds.  Anselm suggests that we needn't rely on external evidence to discover truth about God; rather, the existence of this being is inherently known through what we inherently understand to be true within ourselves. This concept, often referred to as faith, involves accepting truths that lack concrete empirical proof.\n\nIn contrast, St. Thomas Aquinas proposes a different path – one that relies entirely on reason and observable evidence, eliminating the need for faith. This perspective would be advantageous for spreading religious belief, as it would allow individuals to be persuaded by logic alone, potentially broadening the appeal to those who might be hesitant to accept concepts that cannot be empirically proven. Aquinas presents five distinct logical arguments supporting the existence of God: change, causation, contingency, degrees of excellence, and harmony. Each argument essentially demonstrates that the existence of God is logically necessary. He uses the analogy of a missing puzzle piece: even though we haven't directly observed it, the presence of the remaining pieces logically necessitates the existence of the missing one.",
            "Around the 5th or 6th century BCE, a prince who later became known as Buddha was born. His life journey led him to renounce worldly possessions and achieve enlightenment. His teachings eventually gave rise to Buddhism, with Theravada being its most traditional branch. This ancient religion, spanning roughly 2,500 years, has evolved significantly since Buddha's time.  \n\nThis evolution is evident in various aspects, such as the annual water-cutting ceremony observed in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Theravada nation. Both monks and lay followers participate in this ritual, which holds religious significance despite Buddha not having explicitly mentioned such a celebration. These changes range from external practices to the very core tenets of the faith. \n\nOver time, the Theravada Buddhist community, both monastic and lay, has had to adapt its doctrines. This transformation can be attributed to both internal and external influences, some positive and others negative.\n\nIn this discussion, we'll frequently use specific terms to clarify our points. \"Internal\" refers to forces originating from within the Buddhist community, regardless of monastic status, while \"external\" refers to influences from non-Buddhist sources.  \"Hostile\" forces are those that aim to harm or damage the Buddhist community due to negative perceptions of Buddhism. \"Benign\" forces, on the other hand, have no intention of harming or aiding the community, though their actions might inadvertently lead to one or the other. These terms will recur throughout our analysis.\n\nTo begin, we'll examine the fundamental doctrines of Theravada Buddhism. Buddhists seek refuge in the \"Triple Gem\" – the Buddha, the Dhamma (Buddha's teachings), and the Sangha (the monastic community). The Dhamma is essentially represented by the Tripitaka, a collection of three baskets of Buddhist scriptures: the Sutta Pitaka (containing discourses), the Vinaya Pitaka (containing monastic rules), and the Abhidhamma Pitaka (containing metaphysical teachings). These metaphysical concepts include Anatta (no-self), Dukkha (suffering inherent in life), and Anicca (impermanence of all things). Understanding these concepts is essential to ending Sansara, the cycle of death and rebirth, and achieving enlightenment. Along with ending Sansara, one also transcends lobha (desire), dosa (hatred), and moha (delusion) when enlightenment is attained. The Vinaya Pitaka outlines rules for living, with five precepts for lay followers (non-killing, non-lying, non-stealing, non-sexual misconduct, and non-consumption of intoxicating substances). Monks adhere to a more extensive set of disciplinary rules.\n\nThe most foundational principle in Buddhism is the concept of the Four Noble Truths. First, Dukkha – the reality of suffering. Second, attachment causes suffering. Third, suffering can be overcome. And fourth, there is a path to overcome suffering – the Eightfold Path.",
            "The relationship between the United States and Mexico offers a compelling case study in the dynamics of interstate rivalry.  From 1836 to 1893, these two nations were locked in a protracted conflict, as documented by Diehl and Goerts (2000, p. 145). This period witnessed its most intense phase in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where the United States emerged victorious, annexing Texas and the American Southwest.  Numerous other skirmishes ensued, finally subsiding before the outbreak of World War I. \n\nThe roots of this rivalry lay in fundamental differences between the two societies, encompassing religion, culture, and tradition, as well as competing economic interests (Schmitt, 1974, pp. 30-31). This pattern of neighborly rivalry is not unique to the United States and Mexico.  Bordering nations often find their interests converging and diverging, leading to tensions and strained relations. Pletcher (1977) observes that the United States has faced enduring diplomatic challenges with Mexico and Cuba, both geographically proximate and historically adversarial (p. 41). In contrast, other Latin American nations have generally maintained amicable ties with the United States.\n\nReligious differences also played a significant role in dividing the two nations, a recurring theme throughout history.  Frahm (2001) highlights how, while Americans in the 20th century opposed fascism and communism, in the 18th and 19th centuries they were wary of Catholicism and monarchy (p. 86).  Echoing the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, the conflict with Mexico involved both ideological differences and competition for vital interests. However, in this instance, the ideological struggle centered on religious preferences rather than political systems.  \n\nThis distrust had its origins in the historical antagonism between England and Spain, whose colonial legacies cast a long shadow over relations between the United States and Mexico.  Diehl and Goerts (2000) catalogue 17 disputes between the two nations during this 57-year period, the majority stemming from territorial issues, including border raids and incursions. Banditry and outlaw activity from American border towns posed a persistent threat until both nations deployed military forces along their shared frontier (Schmitt, 1974, p. 97).\n\nSchmitt (1974) suggests that the rivalry began to wane as Mexico's economic dependence on the United States grew (p. 109), ultimately culminating in a shift in American interest from territorial expansion to economic intervention in Mexico by the late 19th century (p. 110).",
            "Fifteen years ago, my life took an unexpected turn. An illness, unknown to me until then, brought my active life as a nurse to a sudden halt.  Nursing was a career choice I made as a young person, driven by a deep-seated need for stability and security, something I hadn't experienced growing up.  The advice I often heard was, \"You'll always be able to find work; people will always get sick.\"  Though my true passions lay in science and journalism, perhaps a blend of both, the practicality of nursing seemed like the safer route.\n\nAnd yet, here I was at 46, single, with limited savings, and facing an uncertain future due to my disability. Fifteen years on Social Security Disability have left me with very little to call my own. Each day is a struggle to maintain my sense of security, safety, and self-worth. Nothing feels certain anymore.\n\nHowever, there is one truth that shines through: I wouldn't have survived these years without the unwavering support of my family and a handful of dear friends.  No matter how strong I thought I was, facing a real crisis exposes the fragility of our human strength.\n\nLife is unpredictable. Emergencies, both big and small, are inevitable.  No matter how well we plan, some challenges are simply too overwhelming to face alone.\n\nI agree that we shouldn't solely rely on government assistance. It's clear that our current system has its flaws. Instead, I believe Americans need to rediscover the importance of community and mutual support. We should learn to trust each other, to offer help when needed, and to ask for help when we're struggling.  \n\nConservative rhetoric often glorifies \"rugged individualism\" as the foundation of our nation. However, the pioneers who traversed the rugged terrain of the American West didn't succeed through isolation. They thrived because of compassion, mutual respect, and the shared responsibility of looking out for one another.\n\nSo, yes, be prepared. I am. I have a disaster kit stocked with first-aid supplies, water purification tablets, and even plastic sheeting and duct tape for potential emergencies. Flashlights, batteries, candles, matches, and canned goods are all part of my preparedness plan.  If you have the means, consider growing your own food or learning preservation techniques.  A wood stove can be a valuable asset, though this might not be feasible for everyone. \n\nBut remember, preparedness isn't solely about gathering supplies. It's also about building strong connections with your neighbors.",
            "The evolutionary trajectory of organisms presents a compelling question: what factors guide their development? Though D'Arcy Thompson mused in 1917 that even the simplest life forms remain elusive in mathematical description,  modern science is striving to bridge this gap. Mathematical modeling has found application in understanding the broader aspects of mollusk skeletal development, encompassing both ontogeny and phylogeny (Raup and Stanley, 1981).  Our research seeks to explore how these models, coupled with experimental investigations, can illuminate the mechanisms driving the direction and magnitude of evolutionary-developmental change in the genus *Prunum*.  \n\nUtilizing X-radiographic images of *Prunum* species, we identified quantifiable parameters that form the basis for modeling both hypothetical and actual skeletal morphologies. These parameters were then input into the software program CerioShell (Stone, 1995). Through this, we constructed hypothetical shell morphologies, aiming to define the boundaries of possible morphological variation within *Prunum*. These findings are being integrated with experimental and observational studies to gain deeper insights into macroevolutionary patterns within this lineage.\n\nThe mollusk shell, in essence, can be conceptualized as a tube traversing a three-dimensional space over time. The revolutions or turns of this coiled structure are known as whorls, spiraling around an imaginary central axis termed the columella. The rate at which these whorls expand varies, and the continuous line separating each whorl is called the suture. Typically, the largest whorl, known as the body whorl, represents the final stage of shell growth. The spire, encompassing all whorls except the last, culminates in the apex, the tip of the spiral. In contrast, the base refers to the opposite end. The aperture, an opening, provides an exit for the animal inhabiting the shell.\n\nShells can be viewed from various perspectives: apical, basal, apertural, and abapertural. Apertural view, where the aperture faces the viewer and the apex points upwards, is the most common orientation.\n\nDetermining the number of whorls involves visualizing the shell from the apical perspective and identifying the starting point of the first suture. A line is then drawn, dividing the shell into two sections. Whorls are counted from this line, with estimations made to a quarter whorl.\n\nViewing a shell as a sequence of apertures traversing time and space as the animal constructs its shell provides a unique perspective. By tracing the path of the aperture using the coordinates of each whorl's aperture center and its horizontal and vertical radius, we can create a graphic and mathematical representation.\n\nThis mathematical formulation allows for the modification of parameters, enabling us to explore the potential variations in mollusk skeletogenesis.",
            "The trends in neonatal and infant mortality in Indonesia have remained relatively stable over the past decade. Despite the nation's progress toward achieving several Millennium Development Goals, particularly in water and sanitation, advancements in child and maternal health have fallen short of the targets needed to reach the 2015 goals.  A deeper examination reveals the multifaceted reasons behind these shortcomings, suggesting a need to bolster the overall health system rather than solely relying on targeted interventions.\n\nIndonesia has witnessed an increase in births attended by skilled healthcare professionals, with 72% of births now meeting this criteria. However, this category encompasses traditional practitioners, such as midwives, who lack the capacity to manage complications during pregnancy, contributing to the high rate of maternal deaths attributed to hemorrhage. Consequently, while this indicator shows progress, it provides a somewhat incomplete picture, highlighting the need for further improvements. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the proportion of children under five years of age with diarrheal illnesses receiving treatment from a healthcare professional.  Data on postnatal care remains limited, but it is evident that this area requires significant attention, with low utilization rates nationwide.\n\nCesarean-section rates remain below what might be anticipated, hovering around 4%. These rates also reveal another concerning disparity. While cesarean-section rates stand at 7% in urban areas, they are significantly lower at 2% in rural communities. This disparity underscores the inequitable distribution of healthcare services, with a concentration of resources in urban centers.  Another pressing issue is vertical equity, as there is a 27% gap in service utilization between the poorest and wealthiest quintiles.  This suggests that accessing healthcare services presents a significant challenge for the impoverished, likely due to financial constraints.\n\nMoving forward, improving neonatal and maternal healthcare indicators necessitates addressing the fundamental issue of inadequate service provision.  Specifically, should Indonesia prioritize program-specific approaches or strengthen the overarching health system without concentrating solely on pre- and postnatal care?  Clearly, program-based solutions to the aforementioned challenges are appealing. \"Vertical\" approaches, focusing on specific areas of improvement, often yield faster results and offer more manageable objectives. However, it is crucial to consider potential drawbacks.  \n\nConcentrating resources on a single health sector can lead to a decline in funding and human resources allocated to other vital areas.  This is exemplified by the impact of international funding for HIV/AIDS on the family planning sector.  Moreover, implementing multiple parallel programs within a single area can result in duplicated services and a lack of coordination, leading to increased administrative burden and complexity in supply chains and funding.",
            "Victorian literature is known for its meticulous attention to detail and its focus on the upper classes of the era. However, there are notable exceptions to this trend, with novels like \"Oliver Twist\" and \"Wuthering Heights\" breaking away from convention. Both works incorporate elements of mystery and the unusual, a departure from the typical Victorian novel, which serves to deepen the characters and illuminate their motivations and emotions.\n\nConsider this passage from Dickens: \"And now, hosts of bewildering and confusing ideas came crowding on his mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were angrily disputing; for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, … he found that he was talking to them…. Suddenly he started back at the report of fire arms; and there rose into the air loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes, and all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which weared and tormented him incessantly.” (Dickens, 220)\n\nThese novels often employ mystery through dream sequences or dreamlike states, although the specific purpose and nature of these moments differ. In \"Oliver Twist,\" these experiences frequently offer glimpses into Oliver's inner world, revealing his pain and his understanding of the harsh realities surrounding him. When the shooting of Oliver is revisited in chapter 28, he relives the event vividly, as if in a dream, while desperately seeking help. The passage highlights Oliver's lack of control over the events that transpired, as well as the dire state of his health, as evidenced by his hallucinations of Sikes and Crackit. The shooting overwhelms him, numbing his senses as he fails to notice the \"unseen hand\" carrying him away. He experiences his despair anew, detached from the initial shock of pain, replaced by a constant, gnawing fear. This raises the question of whose will is responsible for Oliver's misfortune, for it certainly wasn't his own. The shooting reinforces the notion that Oliver has little agency, unable to exert even a modicum of control over his fate, even when his life hangs in the balance. A sense of defeat also emerges, suggesting that Fagin has begun to break Oliver, forcing him to accept this despair and hindering his ability to react. Otherwise, it's reasonable to assume that Oliver would have made some effort, if only to save himself.\n\nAnother example of this dreamlike state is found in \"Wuthering Heights\": “The day passed off – day! There was no day; it was gone as soon as come – and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in it’s dreadful silence and short in it’s fleeting ours.”",
            "A couple of years ago, I volunteered at an after-school program designed to assist elementary school students. While I tried to help all the children with their academic challenges, I excelled at tutoring in English and reading. One instructor asked me to work with a young boy named Adrian, who was in either third or fourth grade, as he was experiencing significant difficulties with reading. I quickly realized something wasn't quite right; his reading comprehension presented unusual obstacles. He would pronounce some letters flawlessly, while others were completely foreign to him – it was truly perplexing. I knew he was of Latino heritage, and while he spoke English fluently, his reading skills lagged behind. We struggled to make progress until the day Adrian's mother arrived. \n\nI was supervising a small group of children while the rest of the program participants were on a field trip when she walked in.  His mother only spoke Spanish, and my grasp of the language was limited, as I had only begun learning it. Nevertheless, we managed to communicate using a combination of broken Spanish and hand gestures.  That's when a crucial realization struck me: Adrian wasn't incapable of reading; he simply lacked a strong understanding of the English alphabet. Whether this insight ultimately helped him, I can't say for sure, but I sincerely hope he's doing better now.\n\nI share this story to highlight the pervasive issue of language barriers in our schools, particularly in California. It also illustrates the importance of recognizing that challenges often aren't as apparent as they seem. Even for a child who speaks English fluently, reading can present formidable hurdles. I believe we can all agree that this issue exists, so the question becomes: what can we do about it? In Adrian's case, the solution was relatively straightforward: tutoring him in English reading, focusing on alphabet recognition and pronunciation. However, for children who have limited English proficiency, the solution is far more complex. There is no single, magic bullet. \n\nDual language systems, mainstream immersion, private tutoring, and ESL classes – none of these approaches, in isolation, can fully address this problem. The key lies in a multi-faceted approach that combines all of these strategies. \n\n[A dual language system, for instance, is a commendable concept.  It benefits not only children whose first language is Spanish, but all students. \"Children in two-way bilingual education programs have been found to outperform their peers academically,\" according to research. Many fear that such programs are a wasteful use of resources and that the majority of students will not reap any benefits. This is a misconception.  If we implemented these programs more widely, rather than as an exception, all children would benefit.  \n\nHow do we achieve this? We don't need to require all teachers to be bilingual, which would be an unreasonable and impractical expectation. However, I believe there is no reason why we can't have bilingual aides or tutors to provide support.",
            "From childhood, many of us are told about a force beyond our understanding, something vast and unknowable.  Some seek answers in organized religion, attending Sunday school or temple, while others find solace in introspection.  Tradition often guides our beliefs, leading us to embrace the faith of our upbringing. Yet, some reject these doctrines entirely, clinging to the certainty of their own limited perspective. Our values shift and evolve, reflecting a journey of self-discovery as we navigate the complexities of spirituality. We all yearn for a guiding light, a beacon in the darkness that illuminates our path.\n\n\"A cardinal,\" my father replied when I inquired about his favorite bird.  We sat on the porch, the rhythmic drumming of rain on the tin roof a constant backdrop to our conversation. The overflowing gutters cascaded water onto the wilting plants lining the edge of the porch.  He gazed out at the downpour, his eyes holding a mixture of contemplation and nostalgia.  He had become increasingly frail, his clothes hanging loosely on his frame. His hair, once thick and full, now seemed sparse and wispy. He avoided my gaze, lost in the relentless rain.  I felt a wave of loneliness wash over me, a fear so profound that I couldn't bring myself to voice my impending grief.  To speak of it would only make the reality more unbearable for both of us.  Instead, I embraced him, settled back into my chair, and moved closer, joining him in his silent contemplation of the fading light.\n\nMy father died in December, just five days after I turned twenty-two. The chemotherapy and radiation had prolonged his suffering, extending his life beyond the doctors' initial prognosis, but at what cost?  The purpose of his prolonged pain eluded me.  \"What kind of God would allow this?\" I whispered into the empty night, my prayers unanswered.  I had chosen not to witness his final moments, unable to bear the sight of life slipping away from the man who had brought me into this world. I wanted to remember him as he had lived, not as he died. I knew him better than anyone else, better even than his own family.  I was certain he wouldn't want me to be a passive observer at his death.  For three days, I retreated into my bedroom, curling up in a ball, waiting for the news.\n\nNo one contacted me.",
            "The concept of the \"Gothic Novel\" presents an intriguing paradox, as aptly described by Ian Watt in his work \"The Rise of the Gothic Novel.\" It oscillates between the familiar and the novel, a blend of \"Old\" and \"New.\" This genre has faced a spectrum of critical responses, from derision and accusations of superficiality to fervent praise for its ability to evoke a sense of the \"terrible sublime\" (Burke). Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto,\" considered the progenitor of the Gothic genre, masterfully merges elements of both ancient and modern romances, establishing a new mode of literary expression. Walpole ingeniously combines traditional theatrical elements with a contemporary emphasis on naturalistic descriptions, as he himself labels it \"A Gothic Story\" (Walpole 4). \n\nThe Gothic literary tradition draws heavily on the aesthetics and conventions of medieval Gothic architecture, theater, and customs.  Even at the time of \"The Castle of Otranto's\" publication, the term \"Gothic\" had already been applied to a diverse range of cultures, styles, and eras. It often carried connotations of archaicism or cultural inferiority in comparison to the perceived advancements of the modern era. \n\nThis juxtaposition of the theatrical \"Gothic\" with the novel's innovative format, which offered readers a more intimate glimpse into the characters' inner lives, contributes to the enduring appeal of the Gothic genre. It simultaneously feels both antiquated and refreshingly new to readers separated by time from its origins.\n\nA prominent theme recurring in Gothic literature is the concept of chivalry.  Medieval notions of chivalry, the rigorous training of a knight, are both preserved and reinterpreted in Walpole's seminal work, \"The Castle of Otranto.\" Chivalry holds particular significance for Gothic authors due to its embodiment of idealized qualities like bravery, honor, and competence. These authors, particularly Walpole, often lament the perceived decline of these ideals in contemporary society. Through the invocation of chivalric principles and conduct, the \"Gothic past\" is idealized and romanticized, foreshadowing the genre's evolution towards Romanticism. This romanticization serves as a vehicle to critique the present and aspire towards a more virtuous future.\n\nWalpole, writing during a period of political turmoil and personal accusations, grappled with anxieties about the future. He may have, consciously or unconsciously, drawn a connection between the perceived moral integrity and inherent \"goodness\" of past eras and the perceived failings of modern society. This sentiment is evident in several characters, notably Frederic.  Before we even meet him, Frederic's character is imbued with chivalric attributes:\n\n[Insert the passage describing Frederic here]\n\nThis description is replete with traditionally chivalric imagery. Frederic, a prince who has endured suffering and tragedy, is marked by the tropes of a \"gallant and courteous Knight,\" albeit exaggerated, foreshadowing the Gothic tendency towards excess (66).",
            "The intricate dance of moving goods from initial concept to satisfied customer is known as supply chain management. Coined in 1982 by consultant Keith Oliver, this term encapsulates the delicate balancing act of planning, implementing, and controlling all stages – from raw materials to finished product delivery – to ensure customer needs are met with both speed and efficiency. \n\nAt its core, a successful supply chain rests on six fundamental pillars: production, supply, inventory, location, transportation, and information.  These elements, carefully orchestrated by skilled business managers, are the building blocks of superior customer service.\n\nProduction, the initial spark in this chain reaction, lays the groundwork for everything that follows. It dictates the \"when,\" \"why,\" \"where,\" and \"how\" of creation, driven by a deep understanding of customer desires.  Market analysis becomes crucial here, acting as a compass guiding managers towards the products in highest demand.  Armed with this knowledge, they determine the precise quantities to be produced and the optimal location for manufacturing, factoring in both production volume and product quality to ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nOnce the production site is established, the focus shifts to meticulous scheduling and equipment maintenance. Every detail within production is a vital cog in the machine; neglecting any could result in costly delays and financial repercussions.  Consider, for example, the meticulous processes employed by retail giants like Walmart and Target. From employee uniforms to receiving shipments, every aspect of their operations is meticulously documented, ensuring smooth workflow and clear expectations.\n\nThe second pillar, \"supply,\" encompasses the strategic choices made regarding a facility's core capabilities and its outsourcing partnerships.  A company might have multiple production divisions specializing in various aspects of a single product, each with unique equipment, personnel, and expertise.  Here, the manager acts as a conductor, strategically assigning tasks to the most suitable division or, in some cases, outsourcing certain processes to external companies. This strategic outsourcing aims to enhance \"velocity\" - the ability to deliver quality products with flexibility while simultaneously minimizing costs.",
            "A street corner in a bustling city. A solitary figure stands, holding aloft a hand-made sign, its message stark and unsettling: \"Hitler is alive in Burma.\" This is Ellen Page, famed for her role in the film \"Juno,\" drawing attention to a distant and troubling reality. \n\nBurma, also known as Myanmar, is a Southeast Asian nation currently under the control of a powerful military junta that seized power in 1962 through a violent coup. In 2007, a wave of protests swept through the country, marking the first public dissent in a decade. These demonstrations, led by Buddhist monks in their saffron robes, earned the name \"The Saffron Revolution.\"  Initially met with a degree of tolerance by the government, the situation quickly escalated into a violent confrontation. Monks were met with force, their peaceful gatherings disrupted, and monasteries were attacked. \n\nForeign journalists attempting to document the events were swiftly detained, with one, Japanese photojournalist Kenji Nagai, tragically losing his life on September 27th, 2007, simply for being present at a protest. While official figures claim a comparatively low death toll of 13, a defected colonel from the Burmese army, Hla Win, asserted that the true number was far higher, citing thousands of casualties. \n\nSadly, this pattern of brutal suppression of dissent is not unique to Burma. Throughout history, governments have sought to maintain absolute control over their populations, often resorting to violence and intimidation. From the Roman emperors who claimed divine authority to the Japanese emperors revered as deities, and even contemporary leaders who wield power with an iron fist, the desire for absolute control remains a persistent threat to freedom.\n\nThe Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 stands as a chilling reminder of this dark reality. Intellectuals, labor activists, and students gathered in the heart of Beijing to express their dissatisfaction with the government's authoritarian rule. The official death toll remains shrouded in secrecy, with conflicting reports suggesting a significantly higher number of casualties. \n\nAnother horrific example is the Rwandan genocide of the 1990s, where Hutu militias, backed by the government, systematically slaughtered Tutsis and moderate political figures.  And of course, the atrocities committed by Hitler's Nazi regime during the Holocaust, where millions of Jews were murdered, serve as a stark reminder of the depths of human cruelty.",
            "Duke Ellington's enduring impact on the realm of jazz is largely attributed to both his prolonged career and his exceptional aptitude for molding his musical ensemble. While his pianistic contributions may not be overtly prominent in the compositions selected for this analysis, Ellington's brilliance as a composer shone through in his ability to craft intricate and multifaceted musical pieces that allowed each band member to showcase their individual talents.  Ellington established a framework within which soloists could freely improvise, while simultaneously composing tightly arranged sections and melodic phrases that specifically catered to the unique styles of his musicians, thereby highlighting specific musical concepts. This approach also served to define the overall tone of the orchestra, resulting in cohesive and original sonic textures tailored to each composition.  Through his mastery of individual instrumental voices and their integration within the evolving ensemble, Ellington produced some of the most groundbreaking and exceptional works in jazz history.\n\nThe Grove Music dictionary, when discussing Ellington's distinctive sound and innovative spirit, cites \"Creole Love Call\" as a prime example of his lifelong practice of utilizing vocalization \"as a jazz instrument.\" This early work exemplifies Ellington's talent for incorporating voice to enrich texture and color without relying on lyrical content. \"Creole Love Call\" also exemplifies Ellington's skill in complementing the styles of his soloists, a recurring theme throughout his career. This languid, measured twelve-bar blues piece unfolds across six distinct choruses:\n\nChorus 1: A call-and-response interplay between vocals and reeds, beginning with a smooth, melodic vocal line that gradually transitions to a more raspy sound towards its conclusion. \n\nChorus 2: A muted trumpet solo that expands upon the fundamental melody, emphasizing several extended blue notes.\n\nChorus 3: A soaring clarinet solo performed in a high register, accompanied by a subtle, syncopated piano passage.\n\nChorus 4: The full band replicates the first chorus, with a call-and-response pattern executed by the brass and reed sections.\n\nChorus 5: The pièce de résistance of the piece, as the reeds initiate the call-and-response in a high register, supported by syncopated stop-time rhythms from the brass and rhythm sections. \n\nChorus 6: A return to the structure of the first chorus, featuring a call-and-response exchange between vocals and reeds. In this iteration, the voice adopts the \"growl\" technique, functioning as an instrument during the solo.\n\nTag: A brief concluding section featuring a vocal flourish and a dissonant, novelistic ending provided by the trombone.\n\nEllington's artful utilization of voice to add another dimension of tonal color to this piece is but one example of a stylistic hallmark that permeates his entire body of work. \n\nIn \"Hot and Bothered,\" recorded a year later, Ellington masterfully blends his talent for meticulous orchestration with his keen ear for tonal nuances. A call-and-response phrase between \"Bubber\" Miley on muted trumpet and Baby Cox's scat singing seamlessly merges the vocal qualities of Miley's playing with the instrumental facets of Cox's voice, generating a rich and complementary sonic tapestry. \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\" extends these ideas, as Ellington expertly employs Joe \"Tricky Sam\" Nanton, a stalwart in Ellington's orchestra, to deliver the melody on muted trombone with exceptional effect.",
            "A persistent void had always resided within her, an unyielding longing that refused to be satiated. This yearning first emerged during her adolescence, around the age of fourteen, and three years later, at seventeen, it remained an undeniable presence.  Over time, she realized her desire wasn't for material possessions but for companionship, a connection she hadn't found with anyone, not even the boys who occasionally expressed interest. They made their clumsy attempts at courtship, but she remained unmoved. This peculiar phenomenon puzzled her, prompting constant introspection and attempts to decipher its cause. Years of pondering yielded several theories, but none that felt convincing enough to warrant serious consideration. So, she navigated life, perpetually wrestling with the enigma of her desires.\n\nHer daily life at home was typically tranquil. Her parents, both inherently calm and composed, rarely engaged in arguments, and disagreements with their daughter were equally infrequent. Their sole point of contention stemmed from her insistence on independence and expressive personality. Despite their serene nature, she countered their balanced energies with an exuberance and infectiously fun demeanor, making her a genuinely likable individual, a quality further enhanced by her inherent kindness.\n\nHowever, today's atmosphere was anything but serene. As she wandered through the house, searching for inspiration, a sharp cry pierced the air, her mother's melodious voice laced with distress. She rushed to the kitchen, panic rising within her as she cried, \"Mom?! Mom, what's wrong?\"  She found her mother lying on the ground, writhing in apparent pain, uttering short, pained gasps. Her daughter immediately knelt beside her, reaching out to offer comfort. \"Ouch... sweetie, I... need you to take me to the... hospital,\" her mother gasped, her words fragmented and strained.  Her daughter understood the gravity of the situation. \"Okay, Mom, just tell me where to pick you up.\"  Her mother weakly gestured, and in that moment, the daughter was acutely grateful for the physical training she had undertaken. She carefully lifted her mother, placing her gently in the car's backseat, and drove them to the hospital.\n\nThe hospital was a symphony of disinfectant and sickness, tinged with an underlying fear. However, her daughter was too consumed with her mother's well-being to notice. She rushed her mother inside and immediately summoned medical assistance. A cluster of concerned faces gathered around as someone swiftly procured a gurney and laid her mother upon it. They whisked her away for immediate attention, leaving her daughter to sit anxiously in the waiting area.\n\nHer mother's injury stemmed from a fall from a stepladder while attempting to reach a vase from the top shelf of their highest cabinet.",
            "This research aimed to investigate the link between adherence to a dietary pattern known as the \"Mediterranean Diet\" (Med diet) and the likelihood of developing chronic heart disease (CHD) and stroke, as well as stroke-related deaths.  A specific measurement, the \"alternate Mediterranean (aMed) diet score,\" was used to gauge how closely individuals followed this dietary pattern. The aMed diet is a refined version of the Med diet, emphasizing plant-based foods like fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, and fish, while limiting saturated fats and animal products. Moderate alcohol consumption is permitted.\n\nPrevious studies have shown a correlation between adhering to a Med diet and a reduced risk of both overall and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. Additionally, a clinical trial demonstrated that the Med diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in helping obese individuals lose weight and improve their cholesterol levels. However, these earlier studies did not specifically focus on stroke or stroke-related deaths.\n\nThis epidemiological study followed 74,886 women, aged 38 to 63, who had no prior history of CVD or diabetes. These women were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, a long-term study involving 121,700 female nurses across 11 US states. Over a 20-year period, from 1984 to 2004, researchers calculated an aMed diet score for each participant six times based on their responses to food frequency questionnaires (\"FFQs\") designed to assess their dietary intake over the preceding year.  More than 95% of the nurses remained in the study throughout this duration. The accuracy of the FFQs was confirmed through validation studies. Reports of CHD, fatal CHD, and stroke were verified by examining medical records, autopsy reports, or death certificates. In cases where records were unavailable, diagnoses were considered \"probable\" and included in the study, with approximately 17% of all strokes and 24% of nonfatal myocardial infarcts falling into this category. \n\nFor each FFQ, factors such as body mass index, smoking status, aspirin use, multivitamin intake, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use were calculated. Beginning in 1986, leisure-time physical activity was also assessed. To account for individual variations and provide a more accurate representation of long-term dietary patterns, researchers calculated the average aMed score across two consecutive years. \n\nTo minimize the influence of confounding factors (variables that could potentially distort the results), adjustments were made for age, smoking, BMI, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone use, multivitamin intake, alcohol intake, physical activity, and aspirin use.\n\nCox proportional-hazard modeling was employed to analyze the association between the aMed score and the risk of developing CHD and stroke. Separate models were used for fatal and nonfatal CHD and stroke occurrences.\n\nThe findings revealed that a higher aMed diet score, indicating greater adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern, was associated with a lower risk of developing both CHD and stroke in women.  Over the 20-year follow-up period, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077 cardiovascular disease deaths (combined fatal CHD and strokes) were identified. Women in the highest aMed quintile had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared to those in the lowest quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71).",
            "The year 2007 marked a period of significant economic hardship in the United States.  Unemployment rates surged, the housing market experienced a dramatic downturn, and several prominent corporations faced severe financial distress. This economic downturn continues to have lingering effects, prompting an examination of its origins and potential solutions. At the heart of this crisis lies a complex interplay of factors, including risky lending practices and a vulnerable financial infrastructure. \n\nThe government's encouragement of sub-prime lending, coupled with the pressure on entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to package these mortgages into complex financial instruments, played a crucial role. As borrowers defaulted on their loans, a ripple effect was triggered, destabilizing the financial system and spreading the crisis throughout the broader economy.\n\nThe seeds of this crisis were sown in the late 1990s, during the Clinton administration.  The administration's pursuit of economic growth and increased homeownership led to the relaxation of lending standards. This, unfortunately, created an environment ripe for the sub-prime mortgage crisis that unfolded years later.  Journalists, such as Steven Holmes of The New York Times, at the time raised concerns about the potential consequences of these relaxed regulations, predicting a possible financial crisis reminiscent of the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s.\n\nThe complex nature of mortgages in the years leading up to the crisis further exacerbated the situation.  Innovations like adjustable-rate mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) interconnected various sectors of the economy with the housing market. This interconnectedness resulted in excessive reliance on the housing market, leaving both households and financial institutions vulnerable to price fluctuations.\n\nThe bursting of the housing bubble exposed the fragility of this system. Financial institutions that had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities suffered significant losses. Major investment banks, including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, faced substantial distress, leading to mergers, bankruptcies, and increased government intervention.",
            "Exposition:  The Dreaded Battlefield of Storytelling\n\nExposition, that crucial juncture in a narrative, can be a double-edged sword.  On one hand, it's a chance to paint a vivid picture with your words, to captivate your readers with your mastery of language and your ability to transport them to another world. On the other hand, it can be the very thing that sends your audience reaching for the \"Back\" button, their eyes glazed over from an overload of information.  \n\nThe seasoned writer, Dr. Merlin, can attest to this struggle firsthand.  She's known to let out a frustrated cry when she encounters a deluge of exposition that drowns out the narrative flow.  The key, as any aspiring writer knows, is to \"show, don't tell.\"  Yet, even the most experienced authors can fall into the trap of long, meandering passages that lack action or tension.\n\nExposition, in essence, involves directly informing the reader about events, often in a straightforward manner.  Think of it as a character in a film delivering a lengthy monologue, spewing out a torrent of backstory or crucial details, reminiscent of the \"Ancient Mariner\" reciting his tale.  In fiction, it's the author taking on the role of the omniscient narrator, delivering information rather than allowing the story to unfold organically.\n\nLet's consider an example.  Imagine a story where a heroine's beloved is murdered.  Would you want the author to spend two pages simply stating facts about their relationship:  where and when they met, the extravagant wedding, the tragic demise?  Certainly not!\n\nInstead, you'd expect the author to delve into the husband's character, revealing his love for his wife through his words and actions.  You'd want to see how his presence enriched the heroine's life, how it shaped her thoughts, beliefs, and dreams. A well-crafted introduction to the husband would allow you to connect with him emotionally, to feel the depth of his love and the weight of his loss.\n\nThe point is, exposition should be used sparingly and strategically.  Don't simply state the facts; bring them to life.  Instead of summarizing a character's history, weave it into the narrative, revealing their complexities through their interactions, their choices, and their inner thoughts.\n\nRemember, as a writer, your goal is to engage your readers, to draw them into your world and make them care about what happens.  Don't let exposition become a barrier between you and your audience.",
            "I watched two local news broadcasts from Columbus, Ohio, on August 13, 2011.  The first was a live report from NBC 4. The lead story involved a stabbing incident in Ashley, Ohio. While the victim's name was withheld, the suspect, Shad Hostettler, was identified, and his mugshot was displayed.  The segment, lasting about two minutes, provided limited details, stating that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and Hostettler apprehended. The coverage seemed appropriately concise given the developing nature of the story. \n\nThe next story focused on the shooting of 18-year-old Travis Buyers in the Sharon Woods area. Buyers was critically injured and no arrests had been made at the time. The SWAT team was investigating. This story felt somewhat abbreviated, and I wondered if this was due to the race of the victim and the neighborhood where the incident occurred.  A pattern I've observed is that media coverage of crimes involving minorities often receives less attention compared to similar incidents involving white victims.\n\nThe third story addressed a gunshot hole found in a MedFlight helicopter. Details about the suspected location and the determination that a .22 caliber rifle bullet caused the damage were provided. Crime-Stoppers offered a five-thousand-dollar reward for information leading to the shooter's arrest.\n\nNext, the news briefly touched upon the anticipated rain and thunderstorms for the weekend, mentioning expected temperatures in the mid to low eighties. The segment felt intentionally short, likely intended as a \"teaser\" to encourage viewers to stay tuned.\n\nA story about a robbery at a UDF on Clime Road was also covered. The suspect was described as a dark-skinned Black man wearing a hoodie, approximately six feet tall and weighing around one hundred and fifty pounds.  The emphasis on the suspect's race and skin tone seemed disproportionately long, which struck me as unusual.\n\nFinally, the news reported on Rene Rodriguez, a convicted Texas drug trafficker. He had been sentenced to 300 months in prison for conspiring to distribute marijuana from Texas to Ohio.  The use of \"300 months\" instead of the more common \"25 years\" felt odd, perhaps an attempt to emphasize the severity of the sentence. The mention of Rodriguez's Hispanic background seemed tangential to the story.",
            "The relationship between brothers is complex, characterized by a powerful and often unyielding connection.  This bond encompasses a spectrum of emotions, ranging from affection and admiration to envy and even cruelty. Brothers possess a unique understanding of each other, a level of insight that transcends typical relationships. They see their own reflection in their brother's eyes, not the image others perceive, but a truer, more authentic self.  It is in times of extreme adversity that the true nature of this bond reveals itself, whether for good or ill. The intensity of these emotions inevitably carries a weighty consequence.  Comprehending the emotions that stem from this fraternal tie involves confronting the repercussions they bring. \n\nThe story \"The Scarlet Ibis\" delves into this theme, exploring the turbulent emotions inherent in a brotherly bond. Set against a backdrop of lush, vividly rendered scenery, two young brothers embark on a journey that ultimately proves futile. The story culminates in a scene where profound disappointment collides with intense pride, leaving only one brother to survive. The narrative weaves together the protagonist's direct experiences and interactions with his brother, providing a glimpse into the protagonist's complex emotional landscape and his perception of the world around him. These factors profoundly influence his actions.\n\nThe protagonist's actions are primarily driven by a powerful emotion: pride.  From their initial outings together to their final, fateful adventure, a sense of resentment festers within the protagonist towards his younger brother, Doodle. He yearns for a companion who can share in his outdoor pursuits, someone who can keep pace with him in physical challenges and adventures. This desire is unmet, as Doodle's physical limitations, stemming from a weak heart, make such activities impossible.  The protagonist's dreams of a brother who could join him in his explorations are shattered. This disappointment manifests as anger, even leading to a fleeting thought of harming Doodle. However, Doodle's innocent smile evokes a surge of affection in the protagonist, suggesting that his darker thoughts were ultimately fleeting. Deep down, a fundamental love for his brother persists.",
            "The human brain is a complex system responsible for processing and generating creative outputs. As technology evolved, so too did the analogies used to describe its function. Initially, comparisons were drawn to rudimentary tools like wax tablets and papyrus scrolls, later evolving to encompass the book and, in modern times, the computer. However, it is crucial to remember that these metaphors, while helpful for conceptualization, possess inherent limitations and can lead to misconceptions.\n\nInformation processing begins with sensory input, where our organs translate physical stimuli – touch, temperature, sound waves, or light – into electrochemical signals. These signals undergo a series of transformations within the brain, guided by intricate algorithms operating in both bottom-up and top-down fashions. Consider, for example, the image of a black box against a white background. Bottom-up processing analyzes fundamental elements like color, orientation, and boundary delineations to identify the object as a box. Top-down processing, leveraging prior knowledge and context, refines this recognition, distinguishing it as a solid box rather than a mere void.\n\nOnce processed to a certain level, an attentional gatekeeper determines the significance of the incoming signal and directs it towards appropriate cognitive processes.  While your brain processes every blade of grass when you glance downward, a healthy attentional filter prevents conscious awareness of each individual blade. Conversely, your name, spoken amidst a cacophony, is readily singled out. This selective filtering occurs across multiple processing stages, constantly modulating the flow of information.\n\nFor effective processing, information must first be stored. The brain employs various memory systems, including sensory, working, and long-term memory. Encoding initiates this process, with different strategies employed for diverse sensory inputs. Verbal information, for instance, can be encoded structurally (based on visual appearance), phonemically (based on sound), or semantically (based on meaning). Once stored, information must be maintained. Studies on animals suggest that working memory, holding information for approximately 20 seconds, relies on a continuous electrical loop within a specific neuronal circuit. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is believed to be anchored in the structural organization of certain protein types.\n\nNumerous models attempt to decipher the organization of knowledge within the brain, drawing inspiration from human memory retrieval patterns, computer science principles, and neurophysiological observations. The semantic network model posits that concepts are represented as interconnected nodes, with links signifying their relationships. For instance, in this model, \"chair\" would be linked to \"table,\" which, in turn, might be linked to \"wooden,\" and so forth.",
            "In Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel, *Brave New World*, a chilling critique emerges regarding the impending dangers of technological advancement and the capitalist system that perpetuates it.  The novel paints a picture of a society where communal harmony takes precedence over individual identity. From their earliest moments, citizens are meticulously conditioned to prioritize instant gratification above all else, becoming unwitting players in a larger societal game orchestrated by the omnipresent World Controller.\n\nThrough the lens of Marxist theory, particularly the concepts of homogenization and reification, Huxley’s anxieties surrounding the trajectory of these emerging systems become increasingly apparent. The novel's exploration of false consciousness, a key tenet of Marxist thought, is particularly striking. The general populace, preoccupied with personal gain, remains oblivious to the true power dynamics inherent in the economic structure. This ideological manipulation, akin to the control exerted over the proletariat in Marxist theory, is vividly depicted in the conditioning of *Brave New World’s* citizens.  The lower social castes, designated Delta, Gamma, and so on, lack independent agency; their desires are  shaped and amplified through hypnopædia, a technique that instills a fervent appetite for consumption and indulgence, ultimately serving the interests of the World Controller.  \n\nThe concept of hegemony, wherein a dominant group exerts control over subordinate groups, is also evident in this societal construct.  The lower classes remain unaware of the manipulative forces at play, effectively \"embracing an ideology that upholds this system\" - namely, capitalism and consumerism. The upper echelons, born with the capacity for awareness, choose to remain complicit, accepting their privileged positions.  Even characters like Bernard, an Alpha, barely challenge the status quo. The interactions between these social strata further underscore the perceived oppression inherent in this capitalist system.\n\nRelationships in *Brave New World* are strikingly superficial, lacking the depth and complexity often found in human connections.  Huxley seems to suggest that the confluence of technological advancement and capitalism simultaneously erodes individual freedom and self-expression.  Love and intense emotions are absent; interactions are reduced to mere transactions, often characterized by superficial observations of physical attributes.  The unquestioning acceptance of their assigned positions within the social hierarchy by each class further exemplifies the socioeconomic impact of capitalism.  Their unwavering obedience reflects a Marxist perspective on the proletariat, who are falsely assured of their superiority as long as they continue to consume, obey, and conform to societal norms.",
            "My time at University Park has spanned roughly two and a half years, encompassing four and a half semesters. Navigating the campus, a common challenge for many students, including myself, has often presented a hurdle. During my first year, I resided in an East Halls dormitory, situated at what felt like the easternmost edge of the campus, excluding the stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center.  Commuting from my home in Stuart Hall to classes held in distant locations, such as the Willard Building near the campus core, could easily consume up to 25 minutes on foot, particularly when adverse weather conditions prevailed, which is frequent in our State College climate. Through conversations with a recent alumnus, not much older than myself, I learned that the East Halls dormitories were once isolated from the rest of the university by vast expanses of unused land. This expanse has since been transformed into a tapestry of athletic fields, imposing new structures including the newly constructed Creamery and health services building, and a ring of apartment complexes. As our campus continues its expansion, traversing from one point to another becomes increasingly arduous. What, then, is the most effective solution to this mobility predicament? On a college campus, the bicycle emerges as a viable answer. However, the bicycle alone is insufficient. Students must embrace cycling, and the campus infrastructure must be designed with the needs of bicyclists in mind.\n\nA recent conversation with a friend who recently rekindled his passion for cycling after a several-year hiatus prompted him to ponder why he ever abandoned it.  “Bicycles are exceptional,” he remarked, “while for a period, cycling wasn't perceived as fashionable, it's undeniably the most practical means of transportation.”  Beyond its physical benefits, cycling is the most efficient mode of travel.  A simple breakfast of oatmeal, accompanied by a moderate amount of exertion, can propel you over 30 miles.  Like many undergraduates, I now reside off-campus, located a comparable distance from the campus center as some dormitories.  The most astute decision I've made this year has been to acquire a bicycle.  Daily, I attend classes in Thomas Building, a location that typically requires a 25-minute walk from my residence. Cycling, however, can significantly reduce this duration to a mere 5 minutes, provided I maintain a brisk pace.  However, Pollock Road, the most direct route to Thomas Building from my home, is not always a smooth ride, whether on foot or bicycle.  Walking possesses its own merits, but personally, my schedule is too demanding to allow for extended walking periods.  Without my bicycle, walking would be my sole reliable option for reaching my classes.  Walking to Thomas daily would add an extra 30 to 40 minutes to my day, equating to over two and a half hours each week.  Adding to this the time required for walking to and from other classes, appointments, and other commitments, it becomes an unmanageable burden."
